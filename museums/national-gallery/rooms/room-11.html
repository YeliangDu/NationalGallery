          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas never painted portraits to commission but instead chose sitters from his family and friends. Hélène was the daughter of Henri Rouart, a Master Engineer and amateur landscape painter, who had exhibited with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>. He had been at school with Degas, but the two began a lifelong friendship when Degas served under Rouart’s command during the Siege of Paris in 1871. Rouart also had a substantial collection of contemporary French painting, including work by Degas, who regularly attended Friday dinner at the family home in Paris.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas had previously painted Hélène, aged nine, sitting on her father’s knee, and decided to paint her again as an adult. In a letter to her father from 1883, he compared her red hair to that of women in Venetian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> paintings. Degas originally planned a double portrait of Hélène with her mother, possibly to complement the earlier picture of father and daughter, but abandoned this idea. Once he had decided upon the final composition, Degas set it down with little subsequent alteration. However, he did rework some areas, even using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a> directly on the canvas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the final composition, the 23-year-old Hélène stands in her father’s study, her hands resting on the back of his empty chair. Although she was now married, Degas painted out her wedding ring, perhaps to emphasise her status as a daughter, rather than as a wife. The chair itself came from Madame Rouart’s father, Jacob-Désmalter, a cabinet maker. Using an empty chair to refer to an absent loved one was not unusual, but Degas may have also been prompted by portraits by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> that show a woman standing by a chair, one of which he had sketched when in Genoa in 1859.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A few carefully chosen works from Henri Rouart’s extensive art collection can be seen behind Hélène. Their full meanings and associations would only have been known to Degas and the Rouarts. On the right, behind Hélène’s head, is Corot’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Castel dell’Ovo in Naples</span> (private collection). Both Degas and Rouart were admirers of early Corot, and Naples was also a reference to Degas’s own Neapolitan origins. Rouart also owned Corot’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Woman in Blue</span> (Louvre, Paris), which may have inspired the choice of Hélène’s blue dress. Below Corot’s Naples seascape is a drawing by Millet of a peasant girl seated at the foot of a haystack (Louvre, Paris). Rouart frequently visited <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F7X-0008-0000-0000.htm">Barbizon</a> at the weekends to paint with Millet, and owned over a dozen of his paintings together with many drawings. Along the top of the picture an embroidered Chinese silk wall-hanging helps bind the composition, in part through its russet red, which echoes the warm reds, oranges and browns that dominate the painting. Below, on the left of the picture, are three wooden Egyptian statues in a glass case, which Henri Rouart may have brought back from his trip to Egypt in 1878. Degas exaggerated the size of the figures, which were in fact quite small (around 70 cms).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a painting of paradoxes. Although a portrait of Hélène, her environment says more about her father and, to a lesser extent, about Degas. Surrounded by pictures and artefacts, Hélène stands impassively, the slight tilt of her stance and position of her head echoing the Egyptian statues. She does not meet our gaze, but instead looks into the distance with an air of sadness (possibly a reference to the recent death of her mother). Her thoughts seem to be elsewhere – indeed, given the empty chair and its history, and Egyptian funerary art, this is perhaps a picture about absence.</p></div>

In 1538, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SW8-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Henry VIII of England</a> was looking for a fourth wife, after the death of Jane Seymour in October 1537. As Henry’s official court artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PSX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Holbein</a> was responsible for painting portraits of the King’s potential matches as well as his brides. In 1538 he was sent to Brussels to capture the 16-year-old Christina’s likeness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The full-length format reflects the preferences of a previous monarch, Henry VI: in 1446 he specified that portraits of potential brides should be in this format, to show both their ‘countenance and their stature’. Christina was, according to contemporary commentators, tall for her age. She is depicted here in sombre mourning dress in honour of her husband, the Duke of Milan, who had died in 1535: she wears a black fur-lined satin gown over a black dress, and a black cap covers her hair. Her face and hands appear pale against the deep black that shrouds the rest of her body, but according to her contemporaries she was ‘Very pure, fair of colour she is not, but a mervelous good brownishe face she hathe, with fair red lippes, and ruddy chekes.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is recorded that Holbein’s sitting with Christina only lasted from 1 to 4 p.m. on 12 March. In this time, Holbein would have made sketches –  to use as the basis for the painted portrait (the drawing for her face does not survive). He would have then transferred the drawing to panel using the same technique as he did for his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D5X-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait of Anne Lovell</a>. Henry received an image from the artist a few days after the sitting, probably just a drawing at that stage. He was apparently so pleased with it that he was reported to be ‘in better humour than he ever was, making musicians play on their instruments all day long’. Although their marriage negotiations failed, Henry kept Christina’s portrait until his death in 1547.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young woman’s calm, imposing presence is enhanced by the symmetry of her features and her body, which is constructed geometrically giving her a serene demeanour. Her chin forms the lowest point of a small inverted triangle placed upon another, outlined by the shape of her arms and hands as they clasp her soft gloves. Both balance upon the base of an upright triangle formed by the train of her dress, which anchors her to the ground. Holbein has left little space around her figure, drawing her closer to the viewer and heightening the intimacy of the image.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is a fine example of Holbein’s ability to create the illusion of the sitter’s real presence, achieved in part by his brilliant facility at evoking texture. The black satin of Christina’s gown has a silver sheen where it catches the light, emphasising its smoothness and coolness. The clear light causes her body to cast a dark shadow against the background, asserting her physical presence as well as suggesting the space between her and the wall behind; as with sculpture, Holbein was inviting Henry to imagine walking around her. The source of the vertical shadow to the right is ambiguous, but is perhaps intended to suggests other objects nearby, in Christina’s space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture eventually passed into the collection of the Dukes of Arundel. In 1880 the fifteenth Duke loaned the portrait to the National Gallery, and it became one of its most admired pictures. In the early twentieth century the Duke proposed to sell the portrait, but the sum requested was beyond the Gallery’s finances at the time and there was a risk that it would be sold abroad, specifically to the wealthy American industrialist and collector Henry Clay Frick. The public distress and outrage at the prospect of losing the painting was reflected in numerous articles in the press: as a potential bride of an English king, painted by the most celebrated artist at the English court, Christina’s portrait was regarded as part of the nation’s cultural heritage. The picture was finally purchased for the nation thanks to a gift from a donor (who, at her request, remains anonymous).</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the only painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Klimt</a> in a British public collection. Hermine Gallia, née Hamburger, was born into a Jewish family in Western Silesia (now part of the Czech Republic). In 1893 she married her uncle, Moriz Gallia, who was 12 years older and originally from Moravia. Hermine and her husband were among the many thousands of Jews in the Austro-Hungarian Empire who had moved to Vienna, where they helped create a newly wealthy middle class in the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unable to match the social pedigree of the established Catholic nobility, this new middle class instead asserted itself through cultural patronage, often favouring the avant garde. By around 1900, the Gallias were part of Gustav Klimt’s circle. Klimt was by then Vienna’s most avant-garde, and expensive, artist. He was a founder-member and the first president of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5O-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vienna Secession</a>, an association established in 1897 to promote modernism in art, design and architecture. By commissioning a portrait from Klimt, the Gallias were making a clear statement about their own social status – one that was based on taste, rather than birth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around 40 preparatory sketches for the portrait have been identified. Klimt produced these quickly, as Hermine moved around his studio. In some she is seated in profile, in others she is shown full-face. As with many of his sketches for portraits, Klimt gave little attention to the face, which lacks any distinctive features except for traces of mask-like features. Instead, he focused on the pose, finally choosing one that allowed him to display much of the dress, which takes up almost a third of the picture. It is a fashionable ‘reform’ dress, which had recently replaced the narrow wasp-waist style.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Klimt chose the dress himself, and he may also have been involved in its design with his partner, Emilie Flöge. Made of layers of semi-translucent creamy white chiffon, it is secured by a pale salmon-pink waistband. It was a challenging material to paint. Klimt differentiated between the various patterns and textures of the delicate fabric – the denser layering of the shoulders of the short jacket, for example, contrasts with the narrow stripes of the almost transparent sleeves of the dress itself. The white boa around Hermine’s neck echoes the swell of her shoulders and sleeves, and forms an oval with her tilted head at one end and clasped hands at the other. In the lower left of the picture, the dress’s gossamer train, which sweeps around Hermine’s legs, has a faintly geometrical pattern. This echoes the modernist design of the carpet on which she stands. The mosaic-like treatment of the carpet is itself a reference to mosaics Klimt had admired when he had visited Ravenna, Italy in early 1903. By this time, the Viennese modernist architect Josef Hoffmann was also using mosaic patterns in his architectural designs. Although limited mainly to the carpet, this mosaic effect hints at the ‘<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a>’ style that Klimt was to adopt from around 1906.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Klimt paints Hermine’s dress with long sweeping brushstrokes, using shorter strokes for the ruffles of the boa. The thin paint not only allows the pale priming of the canvas to come through, but also recreates the effect of the translucent material – for example, around her arms. Although soft whites and pale greys predominate, there are hints of pink and also of a blue undertone. Hermine’s face is painted more smoothly. Partly framed by her distinctively styled dark hair, its paleness echoes the white dress below, just as the touches of orange-pinks on her cheeks, lips and ears echo the pink of the waistband and jacket cuffs. The only area of thickly applied paint is the heavily encrusted brooch, which almost stands out from the canvas. The cluster of rings and the pearl earring also introduce tiny highlights of intense colour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Swathed in billowing diaphanous fabric, Hermine herself seems almost to float weightless above the floor. Her white dress recalls portraits by James McNeill Whistler – for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Symphony in White, No. 2: The Little White Girl</span> (Tate Britain, London) – but her stylised outline also has echoes of geishas in the Japanese prints that were highly popular with many artists in the late nineteenth century. The sinuous outline of the drapery shows the influence of the serpentine lines of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Art Nouveau</a>. Although Hermine looks back at us, her expression seems slightly distant, even dreamy, as if she is absorbed in her own thoughts. In a case of life imitating art, one biographer has described how, in later photographs of herself, she tried ‘to live up to Klimt’s picture’ by replicating her pose, tilt of the head and hairstyle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Moriz and Hermine’s support for contemporary art and design was to extend beyond Klimt. They assembled a substantial collection of silverware and ceramics from the Wiener Werkstätte (Vienna Workshop) – they also became shareholders after it faced bankruptcy – and in 1913 commissioned Hoffmann to design and furnish their apartment in a newly built five-storey residential building on wealthy Wohllebengasse (‘Good Living Street’). The couple’s modernist sensibility is evident in Klimt’s portrait, which was first shown in late 1903 in an incomplete but advanced state at the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Klimt Kollektive</span> exhibition at the Secession. Klimt’s ‘ladies’ portraits’ were intended to be part of a carefully designed environment that was a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Gesamtkunstwerk</span> or ‘total work of art’. A photograph published in a contemporary magazine, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Die Kunst</span>, shows that the Gallia portrait was displayed in the exhibition within a typically Secessionist interior, between two cubic chairs designed by Koloman Moser. When the portrait was hung at the Gallias’ home, Hermine’s white dress and the picture’s long rectangular frame complemented the apartment’s fluted white neoclassical columns.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The couple’s assimilation into Viennese society through patronage of modern art and design was only partially successful. Like many Viennese Jews, Hermine and Moriz had their children baptised as Catholics and themselves converted in 1910. This allowed them to enter Vienna’s ‘second society’, just below the older aristocracy, and for Moriz to secure the title of imperial councillor. However, conversion to Catholicism did not protect their children from the anti-Jewish Nuremberg laws introduced in 1935. Following the Anschluss (the union of Austria and Nazi Germany) of 1938, the Gallia children were no longer Austrian citizens, but became German Jews. They fled Austria in late 1938 and settled in Australia, taking this portrait with them.</p></div>
