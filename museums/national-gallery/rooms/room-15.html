        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of Rembrandt’s most famous self portraits, but it is also a painting concerned with history and illusion. We see the artist in confident pose clearly relishing his success. If you had money and taste in Amsterdam of the 1640s and you wanted to commission a fashionable portrait,  Rembrandt’s flourishing workshop would have been high on your list.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, probably made for just such a client, he looks to us as he would have done to them – self-assured, dressed in expensive-looking fur and velvet, his hat laced with jewels. But his contemporaries would have noticed something we don’t: his costume may be impressive, but it is very old-fashioned. Rembrandt – though he is a Dutchman living in the 1640s – is wearing the clothes of a wealthy gentleman of the 1520s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This fancy dress is not the only reference to the past. Rembrandt is also using an age-old artist’s trick or illusion. The wall or parapet at the bottom of the painting is much more than a prop to emphasise the confident nonchalance of his pose. It deepens the perspective, making it seem less like a flat picture and more like a window onto reality. And strangely, while creating a barrier between the sitter and the viewer, it also unites our two worlds: the way that Rembrandt’s elbow and the swirl of his cloak extend forwards over the wall creates the illusion that they share the same space as the viewer. X-ray images show that originally his left hand was also resting on the wall; by drawing it back and tucking it into his cloak, Rembrandt has made himself just slightly more aloof.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This trick of perspective seems to be a reference to some of the great paintings of the Renaissance. Rembrandt appears to have derived the positions of the parapet and the arm from a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DCU-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait by Titian</a>, and there are strong echoes too of a self portrait by Dürer of 1498. Copies were almost certainly available, but both paintings were in Amsterdam at least briefly in the 1630s, so Rembrandt may have studied them then. Meanwhile, the shape of the figure and the colours used are similar to a portrait by Raphael (painted before 1516) which Rembrandt had seen and sketched the previous year.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The reference to Titian’s portrait is particularly interesting, because it was then believed to be of Ludovico Ariosto, one of the most celebrated Italian poets of the Renaissance. So, as the subject of the painting, Rembrandt is portraying himself both as a Renaissance gentleman and, perhaps, a poet from a previous century. At the same time, as an artist he is paying homage to and directly comparing himself with Raphael, Titian and Dürer. The implications of this double echo would certainly have been understood by Rembrandt’s sophisticated clientele. By taking the pose and clothes of a gentleman he was claiming a much higher social status than was usually afforded to artists at the time, a claim emphasised by the reference to a famous poet. And by citing the works of three of the greatest Renaissance painters, he is implying that he is their rightful heir and equal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He also seems to be asserting his mastery by demonstrating his ability to emulate the smooth and meticulous finish of his Renaissance predecessors – a style quite different to his usual energetic brushstrokes. You can still find one typical Rembrandt touch in the painting, however. Look closely at the back of his neck: a handful of lighter streaks show where he has scratched some of the hairs in the wet paint with the pointed end of the brush handle.</p></div>

Her eyes are emphasised by the blue of the sky and her dilated pupils by the black of her hat, but she doesn’t quite meet our gaze. She seems either to have just looked away, or to be plucking up courage to glance upwards. Rubens was clearly fascinated by Lunden and, just a few years later, he married her youngest sister Hélène, who was 16 at the time (he was 52).</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some portraits, perhaps like the people they represent, seem to have charisma: they catch the eye and stand out from the others on the gallery wall. For many people, this painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> is one such picture – it is certainly one of the most famous by him in the National Gallery’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is hard to explain exactly why it is such a distinctive image. But the sitter’s dark, oversized eyes and the exaggerated length of her neck, as well as the background of billowing cloud and the simple colour palette of grey, red, black and blue all contribute to its singular character. There is something too about how the sitter is presented to us – a sense of ambiguity, perhaps. Her lips and the flush on her cheeks are emphasised by the deep-red sleeves, her eyes by the blue of the sky and her dilated pupils by the black of her hat, yet she doesn’t quite meet our gaze. She seems either to have just looked away, or to be plucking up courage to glance upwards. Her arms are crossed in a way that seems slightly defensive, but that also emphasises the narrowness of her waist and the shape of her bust. Rubens has centred her chest, her skin made luminous by the sunlight, while her face is cast in the shadow of her hat brim.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The hat led to the painting acquiring a nickname: ‘Le Chapeau de Paille’ (‘The Straw Hat’). It was a title first used in the eighteenth century, well before the painting was bought by the National Gallery, but how it came to be known by this name is a mystery. Clearly, the hat is a prominent and distinctive feature of the composition; equally obviously, it is not made of straw. The most likely explanation is that the word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">paille</span> may be an error for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poil</span> (‘felt’ in French) – there may have been a transcribing error in an inventory or sale room catalogue that listed the painting. But the same sitter was actually depicted by Rubens on another occasion wearing a straw hat, in a painting that is now in a private collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In fact, this is a felt hat of a type known as a ‘beaver’, fashionable for both men and women in the Netherlands in the 1620s, when this painting was made. Like the large and expensive teardrop earrings, it was a status symbol. The felt which gives it strength and resilience and allows the creation of its long, sweeping brim was made from beaver fur from northern Europe and Russia. Before transatlantic trade with Canada developed and led to large-scale import of pelts, this was a rare commodity and generally worn only by the wealthy. The plume of ostrich feathers was a typical decorative flourish.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So, who is this expensively dressed young woman? Although there is nothing specific to identify the sitter, it is almost certainly a portrait of Susanna Lunden (1599–1643), daughter of Rubens’s friend and client Daniel Fourment, a silk and tapestry merchant in Antwerp. She was married twice: first in 1617 to Raymond del Monte, who died soon after, and then in 1622 to Arnold Lunden. The fact that she wears a ring and seems to be in her early to mid-twenties suggest that this portrait was probably made soon after her second marriage. Surviving records that suggest it was in the possession of the family of her second husband help corroborate this theory. In December 1630, Rubens married Susanna’s youngest sister Hélène, who was 16 at the time (Rubens was 52). They had five children together before his death in 1640.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A life drawing that is probably a preparatory study to this portrait is in the Albertina, Vienna but it shows only the sitter’s head and shoulders. As was often his practice, Rubens enlarged the painting as the work proceeded. The joints between the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panels</a> now show through the paint surface, so we can tell that he added a strip of wood on the right and then enlarged the picture at the base. These additions allowed him to complete the lower part of the sitter’s hands and arms, and also to create a bigger sky. He added the dark, looming clouds to the right to contrast with the clearer sky to the left, from which the light falls across the sitter’s body and hands. This greater expanse of feathery grey clouds seems almost to merge with the contours of the wrap covering her shoulders, and echoes the ostrich feathers in her hat and the wisps of blonde hair which have escaped from under it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait has influenced other artists – Thomas Lawrence’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lady Peel</span>, made in 1827 (Frick Collection, New York) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Self Portrait in a Straw Hat</a></span> by Elisabeth Vigée Le Brun were inspired by it. Le Brun, for example, has used a similar palette and light effects, and, wryly, depicts a hat made of straw, to match the ‘incorrect’ nickname by which Rubens’s painting was already known.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> painted portraits more frequently than any other type of picture and he painted them throughout his long career. This is one of his earliest. It retains the sense of inner mystery expressed in the portraiture of his teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a> but expresses the sitter’s personality with new strength and realism. Titian has captured his subject in a highly innovative, dynamic pose – turning to look at us over his shoulder and momentarily meeting our gaze.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The ‘turning’ portrait, depicting the sitter looking over his or her shoulder, had been popular in Venice since about 1500, for example in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of Francesco Maria della Rovere</span>, possibly painted by Giorgione and certainly associated with him (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). It was also common in early <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Italian portraits to use an imaginary parapet to resolve the problem of how to crop a figure not portrayed at full length. This device further served to divide the sitter’s space from that of the viewer. But unlike in most earlier portraits featuring a parapet, the sitter here is cut at waist rather than bust level, emphasising the volume of the torso and arms and creating a new sense of monumentality and space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s elbow rests on the parapet and his voluminous quilted sleeve projects into our space, creating a strong sense of his physical presence. The blue of the quilted satin sleeve was painted over a pink ground and fine red lines are threaded through it. It must originally have been more purple in tone but the red lake <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> has faded over time, while surface abrasion has somewhat reduced its sense of volume. The sitter’s right hand appears to be in a fur muff, although this is now difficult to make out. The merging of the shadowed portions of the figure with the grey atmospheric background was, however, certainly intended, and is one of the most innovative and influential aspects of the portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s body forms a stable triangle in the centre of the canvas. The solidity and balance of the composition means that the decisive turn and tilt of his head produces a dramatic effect. Our attention is focused on the raised brow above his right eye, which is positioned midway across the picture. This novel and effective pose was to become highly influential in European portraiture, serving as a model for such famous pictures as Rembrandt’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Self Portrait at the Age of 34</a></span> of 1640, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self-Portrait</span> of about 1640 (National Portrait Gallery, London) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reynolds</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self-Portrait</span> of 1775 (Uffizi, Florence). The pose may have been popular, but it was uncomfortable. The diarist Samuel Pepys records sitting for Van Dyck: ‘I sit to have it full of shadows and do almost break my neck looking over my shoulders to make the posture for him to work by.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was long believed to be a portrait of the celebrated Italian poet Ludovico Ariosto (1474–1533), and it was later thought to be a self portrait by Titian – possibly why so many artists chose to portray themselves in this pose. However, it is likely to be a portrait described by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Giorgio Vasari</a> in his 1568 biography of Titian. Noting that the artist was no more than 18 years old, Vasari identifies the sitter as a member of the aristocratic Venetian Barbarigo family. The most likely candidate is Gerolamo di Andrea Barbarigo, who was the grandson of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Doge</a> Marco Barbarigo. In 1509 Gerolamo was elected as one of the magistrates responsible for navigation, a position for which one had to be at least 30 years old. He belonged to Venetian humanist circles and enjoyed a political and diplomatic career in Venice and its mainland territories.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Vasari records that through Barbarigo’s intervention, Titian was commissioned to paint in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> certain scenes on the Fondaco dei Tedeschi (German merchants‘ warehouse) in Venice, for which his older colleague Giorgione had painted the principal facade. The sitter in a contemporary portrait at Alnwick Castle, probably not by Titian but close to his style, closely resembles the one in Titian’s portrait, but has brown rather than blue eyes. He may be another member of the Barbarigo family, possibly a brother to the National Gallery sitter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is hard to assess the accuracy of Vasari’s statement as to Titian’s age when he painted the portrait. It is certainly possible that he was no more than 18, although he could have been slightly older than that. We know that Giorgione completed work on his frescoes for the Fondaco dei Tedeschi in December 1508 and that Titian began his afterwards, suggesting that the younger artist worked there in the summer of 1509. A later statement by the Venetian author Lodovico Dolce that Titian worked on the Fondaco dei Tedeschi when he was not more than 20 is generally considered to be reliable.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is notable that Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo</span> and Sebastiano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salome</a></span> of 1510 employ the same arrangement. It is impossible to say which picture was painted first, but the fact that Titian’s is more commandingly three-dimensional would suggest that he was upstaging his friend Sebastiano’s picture, rather than the other way round. It is unlikely, however, that they are far separated in date – both artists were close associates of Giorgione, who pioneered the ’turning portrait‘, and they responded rapidly to each other’s innovations at the time. Another related picture is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ carrying the Cross</span> in Scuola Grande di San Rocco of around 1508–9. Thought to have been painted by Giorgione or Titian, its figure of Christ resembles closely the man with the quilted sleeve, and may have been based on the same model or acted as a formal prototype for the National Gallery portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E9K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Lady (’La Schiavona‘)</a></span> Titian has inscribed his own initials ’T. V.‘ (Tiziano Vecellio) on the parapet. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> reveals another V in the centre of the parapet, which has been painted out. The mysterious abbreviation VV once also appeared on ’<span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Schiavona</span>‘ and on other Venetian portraits of this date, such as Giorgione’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Giustiniani Portrait</span>. It may stand for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">virtus vincit</span> (’virtue is victorious‘), <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vivens vivo</span> (’from life by the living‘) or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">virtù e verità</span> (’virtue and truth').</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Elizabeth Louise Vigée Le Brun’s</a> life spanned a tumultuous period of French history. Born in Paris in 1755, she was the daughter of a portrait painter, Louis Vigée. His early death in 1767 left her without a teacher, so she was largely self-taught. Her husband, the art dealer Jean-Baptiste-Pierre Le Brun, played a significant role in her early career by providing her with important contacts and commissions. She adopted his name but eventually left him – the marriage was formally dissolved in 1794.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the years preceding the French Revolution in 1789, Vigée Le Brun enjoyed great success, particularly at the Versailles court. One of the most successful society portraitists of her time, she was also one of only four women admitted to the Académie royale de la peinture et de sculpture during the eighteenth century. She became the preferred painter of Marie-Antoinette and painted over 30 portraits of the Queen and her family. A portrait of Marie-Antoinette wearing a simple white cotton chemise and holding a rose caused a scandal when exhibited at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> in 1783 because of its informality. Following the arrest of the royal family in October 1789, Vigée Le Brun fled Paris and did not return until 1802.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self Portrait in a Straw Hat</span> is a signed copy by Vigėe Le Brun of a very popular self portrait she had painted in Brussels in 1782. The portrait was exhibited in the same year at the Salon de la Correspondance in Paris and at the 1783 Salon of the Académie royale. It is now in the collection of the baronne Edmond de Rothschild. The pose is deliberately modelled on Rubens’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D1A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Susanna Lunden (?)</a></span>, which was formerly, but incorrectly, known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Le Chapeau de Paille</span> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Straw Hat</span>) – ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">paille</span>’ (straw) may be a corruption of ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">poil</span>’ (hair), as the hat is in fact made of beaver felt. Vigée Le Brun had studied and copied paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> and saw his portrait of Susanna when she was visiting Antwerp. The portrait was well known in France, at least by reputation, and several writers had commented on its depiction of light. In particular, they noted how the hat’s broad rim cast the face in shadow, which, as a result, was lit solely by reflected light. In a letter to Princess Kourakin included in her <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Memoirs</span> (published in 1835), Vigée Le Brun similarly commented, ‘its great effect resides in the two different lights, ordinary daylight and the glow of the sun.’ She continues, ‘This painting delights me and inspired me to make my own portrait in Brussels in search of the same effect. I painted myself wearing a straw hat with a feather and a garland of wild flowers, and holding my palette. When the portrait was exhibited at the salon, I dare say it greatly enhanced my reputation.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite its apparent informality, Vigée Le Brun offers us a highly calculated image in which she also explicitly associates herself with a great artist and his sitter. Looking at us directly with an open expression as she holds the tools of her profession (a palette and brushes), she presents herself as an elegant society lady and as an accomplished professional artist. By posing outdoors – and not, for example, in a studio – she replicates the contrasting light effects in Rubens’s portrait by combining ordinary daylight with direct sunlight. Although wearing a plain straw hat (in keeping with the original title of Rubens’s painting), Vigée Le Brun wears a low-cut dress unlike Susanna, who  crosses her arms above her waist while peering out from under her hat. In keeping with the effect of naturalness, Vigée Le Brun’s hair is her own – rather than a wig (which she would be expected to wear for a formal portrait) – and is unpowdered. Her hat is decorated with fresh flowers and a white ostrich feather, whose textures echo the hair and clothing. The hat and flowers were consistent with contemporary fashions in the pastoral mode and especially recall pictures of shepherdesses – a favourite guise also of Marie-Antoinette, who even had a fake rustic village built in the grounds at Versailles.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the National Gallery’s version of the self portrait is a copy that Vigée Le Brun herself made of her original portrait (the copy was probably also painted in 1782), there are some minor, but significant, differences between the two paintings. In light perhaps of her comment that the original portrait had ‘greatly enhanced my reputation’, the National Gallery’s version presents a more assertive and self-assured image. This self-assurance is in part achieved by slight changes to the face – in the copy, for example, the eyebrows are heavier, the shape of the eyelids is given more emphasis, the lower lip is fuller, and the mouth more smiling. Vigée Le Brun has also changed the colour of her satin dress from a shade of lilac to a rose pink. Perhaps in response to comments by Salon critics that the unbroken blue sky of the original painting was too basic or just too blue, she has broken up the sky in the copy by adding wispy white clouds.</p></div>
