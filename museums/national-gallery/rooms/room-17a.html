        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a very small and very unusual painting, showing a view of the Nieuwe Kerk in Delft as though through a wide-angle lens. We look roughly north-west over a canal from the corner of two streets, the Oude Langendijk and Oosteinde. The grey shape just to the left of the church is the town hall. Both these buildings look much the same today, but the canal has been filled in and the houses on the right have been knocked down.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Views of particular streets and buildings were popular in seventeenth-century Holland, and especially in Delft, where Fabritius worked. The exaggerated perspectives the artist created make this one unusual. The church seems to loom towards us and the bend in the cobbled street seems to reflect the curve of a glass lens.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The effect is most strongly emphasised in the two musical instruments, set out on the table by a man who sits watchfully in the shade. He is probably a maker of, or dealer in, such instruments, and this is his stall. Fabritius may have had an aesthetic appreciation of the shape and form of the instruments, but he also wanted to use them to create a visual illusion. He uses a dramatically foreshortened view along the strings and fingerboard of a violin (or possibly a viola da gamba) so that the instrument appears extremely close to us. It follows the line of the street behind, which leads away from the centre of the picture, drawing our eye to the bulbous back of a lute leaning up against the wall. There we also see Fabritius’s signature carved into the wall as though it were a piece of graffiti.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Together, the impression of the instruments‘ closeness, the church as centrepiece in the middle ground and the lines of sight disappearing off into the distance on either side have led many art historians to conclude that Fabritius designed the image to create a specific optical illusion. It was probably made to be fitted into a viewing box and looked at through a lens or peephole. This would have created an impression of depth, so viewers were deceived into believing they were looking at a three-dimensional scene. This was known as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FDA-0008-0000-0000.htm">trompe l’oeil</a> effect (or trick of the eye) and several artists of the time specialised in such illusions.

It has two sight holes which allow a view of an interior and was probably made about five or six years after the Fabritius painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">What hasn’t been definitively proven is exactly how Fabritius’s view was intended to be mounted and looked at. It may be that it was made to be pasted onto a curved surface inside the box, or perhaps viewed through a lens which created a particular optical distortion.</p></div>

It is a rectangular wooden cabinet painted on the inside and outside, and open on one end to let in light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Looking into the open side, which was originally covered with translucent oiled paper, we see a distorted jumble of walls, windows, open doors, crooked floor tiles, misshapen chairs and an oddly proportioned dog. It is only when we peer through a peephole – there’s one on either side of the cabinet – that everything falls into place: we see the illusion of a three-dimensional seventeenth-century Dutch house, with views into a variety of rooms and outdoor spaces. The rooms are quiet: one woman lies asleep in bed, while another reads in a chair. The only other living being in the house is a dog, though a man outside peeks in through a window.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A letter addressed to the artist lies on one of the chairs in the middle room, while a portrait print bearing the van Hoogstraten family crest appears to the left of the bedroom door. This suggests that we are actually peeping into the artist’s imaginary home. And van Hoogstraten further teases the viewer, reminding us of our intrusion into this quiet domestic space. When looking into the box from the left, our behaviour is mirrored by the man opposite, who secretly watches the reading woman through the window. Looking through the hole on the right, our gaze is met by the dog, which has spotted us spying on the women in the house.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The three external sides of the box show allegorical scenes representing concepts that inspired the artist. The Latin inscriptions on scrolls of paper identify them: ‘Amoris Causa’ (‘for the sake of love’), with a young artist drawing Urania, one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F47-0008-0000-0000.htm">the Muses</a>; ‘Lucri Causa’ (‘for the sake money)’, with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putto</a> pouring coins from a cornucopia while a painter works on a portrait; and ‘Gloriae Causa’ (‘for the sake of glory’), with a putto placing a gold chain around a painter’s neck and crowning him with a laurel wreath. On the top lid of the cabinet is an image of a nude woman lying in bed, usually identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, accompanied by the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 12 October 1654 – the date inscribed on the painting – one of the gunpowder stores in the city of Delft accidentally detonated, flattening a large part of the city. A local artist, Egbert van der Poel, was so fascinated by the event that he painted this scene at least 20 times. Judging from contemporary maps and buildings which still exist, the pictures appear to be a largely accurate view of the devastation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">All that was left on the site of the store was a deep pool of water (probably the one we can see on the right side of this picture).

Heard more than 70 miles away, it flattened a large part of the city and, though no records survive, hundreds of people must have been killed.

More than 20 versions still survive, all depicting the same buildings, though the figures are different in each case. As van der Poel was a member of the Delft guild of painters, we can be pretty confident that he based his paintings on his own observations on the day of the explosion or very soon afterwards, even though some of them were painted much later.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Judging from contemporary maps and buildings which still exist, the picture appears to be a largely accurate view of the devastation as seen from the north-east. According to a contemporary account, all that was left on the site of the store was a deep pool of water – presumably what we see on the right side of the picture. The prominent buildings on the horizon are, from left to right: the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Nieuwe Kerk</span> (New Church), the tower of the town hall, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Oude Kerk</span> (Old Church) and, to the right, the chapel of the hospital of St George in Noordeinde.

There’s a sense of confusion and disorientation among the knots of people who have gathered to try to help the wounded, or to come to terms with what has happened. Two men are intent on rescuing possessions in a basket, but most seem dazed or bewildered; they gesture in amazement, or stand with arms open in shock.</p></div>
