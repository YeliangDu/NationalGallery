The sharp cry of pain which distorts his features seems to be what has attracted the attention of his fellow drinkers. It isn’t made explicit whether we are witnessing a prostitute fighting off a drunken client or a sexual assault on a barmaid, or simply watching a lovers’ tiff. Most likely, in this environment, the woman would have been perceived as a prostitute.

Such a tension over whether to react with moral outrage or be entertained by promiscuous behaviour is apparent in many paintings made in Holland and Flanders during the seventeenth century. Brouwer worked in both countries and early biographies of him suggest that he was not unfamiliar with tavern life.

The woman sitting in a red velvet upholstered armchair sports an abundance of gold jewellery. Standing proudly to the right, the man has a commanding presence: he holds a tall staff with one hand and rests the other on his hip, his elbow turned out towards us. He displays a bold red sash and an ornate sword.  The sash, sword and staff all suggest that this man held a military office. The portrait seems to have a slightly comical note: the man’s head is paired with the stone face of a laughing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a> on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilaster</a> next to him, and his bemused expression is mirrored by the little dog looking straight at us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was initially painted three-quarter-length: a horizontal seam running the width of the canvas at a point just level with the man’s knees indicates that the composition was subsequently extended. We do not know whether the patron wished for a full-length portrait at a later stage or if the artist decided on the change.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Once thought to represent Govaert van Surpele (1593–1674) and his wife, from Diest in South Brabant, the sitters in this portrait can now almost certainly be identified as belonging to the Antwerp branch of the same family. Cornelis [van Surpele] van Diest, dean of the guild of cloth manufacturers and captain of the city militia, and his wife Lucretia Courtois seem to be the more likely candidates.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jordaens</a> was not a prolific portrait painter (only around 30 portraits by his hand are known) and it seems that his clientele was exclusively drawn from the well-to-do merchants and burghers of Antwerp. In this case a personal connection between van Diest and Jordaens is likely. From 1634, van Diest owned a house in the same street as the artist’s birthplace, house and studio. Jordaens’ father was also a linen merchant, so there is a good chance the families were acquainted. The single coat of arms in the background, which was probably added soon after the painting was completed, may also be significant for the identification of the sitters. Govaert van Surpele’s wives were from distinguished families with their own coat of arms, which would have been included in the painting, while the family of Lucretia Courtois lacked any armorial insignia.</p></div>

In this case a personal connection between van Diest and Jordaens is likely. From 1634, van Diest owned a house in the same street as the artist’s birthplace, house and studio. Jordaens’ father was also a linen merchant, so there is a good chance the families were acquainted. The single coat of arms in the background, which was probably added soon after the painting was completed, may also be significant for the identification of the sitters. Govaert van Surpele’s wives were from distinguished families with their own coat of arms, which would have been included in the painting, while the family of Lucretia Courtois lacked any armorial insignia.</p></div>

This is an undated self portrait, and going by what his contemporaries said about the artist – Jan Lievens –  we shouldn’t be surprised at his self-confident air. In the 1650s, when he was painting a portrait of Sir Robert Kerr, the English ambassador, Kerr wrote a letter describing him: ‘he thinks there is none to be compared with him in all Germany, Holland, nor the rest of the 17 Provinces [of the Low Countries].’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lievens‘ confidence isn’t just apparent in his bearing. His dress is that of a man of wealth and fashion. The padded silk gown (known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">japonse rock</span>) was expensive and probably imported from Japan. The gown and billowing shirt, sleeves tied back with wide black ribbons, first came into fashion in the early to mid-1650s, which was also the time that gentlemen started to wear their hair long and loose, as Lievens does here. That date also fits with the style adopted by Lievens for the landscape in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait in particular reflects how Lievens’ style, once close to that of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>, had changed after he was exposed to other influences. From 1635 to 1643 he worked with Flemish artists in Antwerp. And before that, in the early 1630s, he was in London, painting at the court of Charles I, where he met <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a>. In fact we know that this is a self portrait in part because the face and features closely resemble a painting Van Dyck made of him in London about 1632 (now lost, but known through an engraving after it).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His chosen dress is interesting in this context. In the seventeenth century self portraits were a way for artists to demonstrate their skills to potential clients, but they were also a way of claiming higher social and artistic status. Rembrandt tended to do this by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">posing in antique-style clothes</a>, aligning himself with the great Italian painters of a century and more earlier. But Lievens’ experience working with the dashing Van Dyck at the English court made him far more interested in emulating the aristocracy’s latest fashions, and also providing them with a more impressive setting than, for example, the shadowy brown background favoured by Rembrandt. The landscape behind Lievens – which unusually appears to be a moonlit rather than a day-time scene – includes a long avenue suggesting the formal grounds of a country estate. The aristocracy were, after all, among his most important customers, and he needed to be able to paint them in a suitable style.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a> was the greatest public artist of the seventeenth century. He was invited to palaces and great churches throughout Europe to paint grand state portraits, rituals of the Catholic faith and opulent allegories. But in this landscape he celebrates what he treasured most: the prosperity and peace of Flanders, his native land.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1630 Rubens returned to Antwerp exhausted and in poor health. His beloved first wife, Isabella Brant, had died four years before, but he was now able to find domestic happiness again with his second wife, Hélène Fourment. There were to be no more diplomatic missions. He took on a few portraits and other commissions, but concentrated on the kind of paintings he wanted to do for himself: landscapes. Rubens had been ennobled both in Spain by Philip IV and in England by Charles I; in 1635, this status and wealth enabled him to purchase the manor of Het Steen, near Malines (now known as Mechelen), with the approval of the Council of Brabant (such a purchase was not open to people of lower rank or prosperity).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sixteenth-century manorial castle with park, pastureland and meadows was a place of retreat in the summer months. There, Rubens could recover his health and paint the landscapes he loved rather than the subjects he was obliged to do for his patrons. At the time, landscapes were considered inferior in status to large images of historical events or biblical stories and to portraits of people of high standing. Only <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre paintings</a> were seen as of a lower order. Rubens was one of the first to recognise and grasp the significance of landscape as a means of expressing mood, atmosphere and, not least, delight in the natural world. His nephew wrote that the estate of Het Steen gave the artist the opportunity ‘to paint vividly and from nature the surrounding mountains, plains, valleys and meadows, at sunrise and sunset with their horizons’ – as he did when painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Autumn Landscape with a View of Het Steen in the Early Morning</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On a crisp autumn morning, the rising sun casts a cool light on the manor of Het Steen. The low rays of the sun flicker across the vast surrounding landscape, bringing it and the inhabitants to life. Shadows are long and there’s a suggestion of dew on the grass of the meadows. The windows of the manor house and the stream meandering past it twinkle, and the few feathery clouds are tinged with gold. We are high up so the view is spread before us, allowing us to pick out each incident within the whole, from the tiny, almost invisible, towers of the city way off in the distance to the turrets of the manor house close by. A man with a gun and a lurcher dog crouches, ready to shoot the partridge feeding nearby. Milkmaids are already at work among the cows in the field beyond. On the left, colours are mellowed in the shadow of the tall, spindly birch trees. A couple set off to market on their sturdy farm cart, the rosy-cheeked wife enthroned on a heap of their goods, a giant brass milk-pitcher on her arm. Behind them, the lord and lady of the manor take a stroll as a nursemaid cradles their baby and a man fishes for breakfast in the moat.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The high view also allows us to see how the wide panorama is achieved through bands of colour that extend across the picture – browns enlivened with deep red for the foreground, greens and golds for the middle ground and blue for the misty distance. This was the ‘bird’s-eye view’ of traditional Flemish landscapes and one of the last in this style that Rubens painted. Many of his other landscapes still have a high viewpoint, but in them we look down on the scene rather than out at it, focusing on one incident. The far distance is often blocked with rocks and trees, as it is in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D2B-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Watering Place</a></span>, another of his most famous landscapes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens painted this picture for his own delight – perhaps as a mark of a life well lived and a reward well earned. We can be reasonably sure that it was never a commission because of the oak panel, or panels, on which it is painted. The supports of other great pictures intended for wealthy patrons, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Samson and Delilah</a></span>, are always in no more than two or perhaps three large sections. The support for this work, however, appears to have been cobbled together from several small and unevenly shaped panels in an almost higgledy-piggledy fashion, with bits added and pinned together with short planks as Rubens went along – a method unacceptable to a collector.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was in Rubens’s possession when he died, together with its companion, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Rainbow Landscape</span> (now in the Wallace Collection, London). That work, which is also painted on patched-together panels, gives a different view of his estate in the evening. It is thought that the paintings once hung in Rubens’s house, on opposite walls of the same room. The wall in between had a window, and the paintings were probably positioned so that the sunlight pouring into the room matched that depicted in each work. The sun shines from the left in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Rainbow Landscape</span>, so that work probably hung on the right-hand wall; in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Autumn Landscape with a View of Het Steen in the Early Morning</span>, the sun appears on the right, so it must have hung on the left-hand wall.</p></div>
          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a> was the greatest public artist of the seventeenth century. He was invited to palaces and great churches throughout Europe to paint grand state portraits, rituals of the Catholic faith and opulent allegories. But in this landscape he celebrates what he treasured most: the prosperity and peace of Flanders, his native land.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1630 Rubens returned to Antwerp exhausted and in poor health. His beloved first wife, Isabella Brant, had died four years before, but he was now able to find domestic happiness again with his second wife, Hélène Fourment. There were to be no more diplomatic missions. He took on a few portraits and other commissions, but concentrated on the kind of paintings he wanted to do for himself: landscapes. Rubens had been ennobled both in Spain by Philip IV and in England by Charles I; in 1635, this status and wealth enabled him to purchase the manor of Het Steen, near Malines (now known as Mechelen), with the approval of the Council of Brabant (such a purchase was not open to people of lower rank or prosperity).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sixteenth-century manorial castle with park, pastureland and meadows was a place of retreat in the summer months. There, Rubens could recover his health and paint the landscapes he loved rather than the subjects he was obliged to do for his patrons. At the time, landscapes were considered inferior in status to large images of historical events or biblical stories and to portraits of people of high standing. Only <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre paintings</a> were seen as of a lower order. Rubens was one of the first to recognise and grasp the significance of landscape as a means of expressing mood, atmosphere and, not least, delight in the natural world. His nephew wrote that the estate of Het Steen gave the artist the opportunity ‘to paint vividly and from nature the surrounding mountains, plains, valleys and meadows, at sunrise and sunset with their horizons’ – as he did when painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Autumn Landscape with a View of Het Steen in the Early Morning</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On a crisp autumn morning, the rising sun casts a cool light on the manor of Het Steen. The low rays of the sun flicker across the vast surrounding landscape, bringing it and the inhabitants to life. Shadows are long and there’s a suggestion of dew on the grass of the meadows. The windows of the manor house and the stream meandering past it twinkle, and the few feathery clouds are tinged with gold. We are high up so the view is spread before us, allowing us to pick out each incident within the whole, from the tiny, almost invisible, towers of the city way off in the distance to the turrets of the manor house close by. A man with a gun and a lurcher dog crouches, ready to shoot the partridge feeding nearby. Milkmaids are already at work among the cows in the field beyond. On the left, colours are mellowed in the shadow of the tall, spindly birch trees. A couple set off to market on their sturdy farm cart, the rosy-cheeked wife enthroned on a heap of their goods, a giant brass milk-pitcher on her arm. Behind them, the lord and lady of the manor take a stroll as a nursemaid cradles their baby and a man fishes for breakfast in the moat.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The high view also allows us to see how the wide panorama is achieved through bands of colour that extend across the picture – browns enlivened with deep red for the foreground, greens and golds for the middle ground and blue for the misty distance. This was the ‘bird’s-eye view’ of traditional Flemish landscapes and one of the last in this style that Rubens painted. Many of his other landscapes still have a high viewpoint, but in them we look down on the scene rather than out at it, focusing on one incident. The far distance is often blocked with rocks and trees, as it is in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D2B-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Watering Place</a></span>, another of his most famous landscapes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens painted this picture for his own delight – perhaps as a mark of a life well lived and a reward well earned.

The rising sun reflects in a pool and reaches through the trees to catch the sleek white hides of some of the cows. It’s an idyllic, rustic scene, but there is energy: people are working and animals moving. Apart from the milkmaid, a youth sits astride one of his horses as they drink in the stream while a man with a pole struggles to release an obstinate animal from the muddy grass on its bank.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> has filled the picture with minute detail, from the many different kinds of foliage to the tiny scarlet flowers on a branch hanging from the cliff. Almost hidden in the undergrowth, two black goats forage for food and two magpies perch in the branches of the central trees. The surrounding landscape is almost shielded from view by the towering cliffs. This follows the Flemish landscape tradition that stems from the paintings of Joachim Patinir, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in a Rocky Landscape</a></span>, painted about a century before Rubens’s picture. But here Rubens has added a dense forest with trees massed together, their branches interwoven and their exposed roots gnarled, with light filtering through the poplar trees in the distance and focusing on the busy figures in the foreground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little to the left of the animals by the water, a flock of sheep grazes on a rocky outcrop at the foot of the cliffs. This section of the painting is a free copy of the central part of Rubens’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CVT-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Shepherd with his Flock in a Woody Landscape</a></span>.

An X-ray image has revealed that the shepherd boy in a red jacket in the other painting once also appeared in ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Watering Place</span>’, in exactly the same pose, but it is thought that Rubens painted him out, possibly because he distracted from the group of figures and animals below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In seventeenth-century Flanders, landscape began to be accepted as a genre of its own instead of as a mere background for narrative paintings or portraits.

This follows the Flemish landscape tradition that stems from the paintings of Joachim Patinir, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in a Rocky Landscape</a></span>, painted about a century before Rubens’s picture. But here Rubens has added a dense forest with trees massed together, their branches interwoven and their exposed roots gnarled, with light filtering through the poplar trees in the distance and focusing on the busy figures in the foreground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little to the left of the animals by the water, a flock of sheep grazes on a rocky outcrop at the foot of the cliffs. This section of the painting is a free copy of the central part of Rubens’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CVT-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Shepherd with his Flock in a Woody Landscape</a></span>. The two pictures were painted at about the same time, both on oak <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panels</a>, and this replication is unique in Rubens’s work. An X-ray image has revealed that the shepherd boy in a red jacket in the other painting once also appeared in ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Watering Place</span>’, in exactly the same pose, but it is thought that Rubens painted him out, possibly because he distracted from the group of figures and animals below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In seventeenth-century Flanders, landscape began to be accepted as a genre of its own instead of as a mere background for narrative paintings or portraits. For Rubens in particular it became a way of celebrating the Flemish countryside he loved. But in England, landscape painting was still neglected, even into the eighteenth century, until artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Richard Wilson</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Thomas Gainsborough</a> turned their attention to it. The latter saw <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Watering Place</span> in London in 1768 and painted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">a landscape inspired by it</a> in homage to Rubens.</p></div>
