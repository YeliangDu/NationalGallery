        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his first letter to the Corinthians, Saint Paul outlines the importance of faith, hope and charity, naming charity as the greatest of the three.  At the time this picture was painted, charity meant combining the love of god with love of one’s neighbour. From the sixteenth century onward, charity was often represented as a woman, shown breastfeeding a child or children; <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> instead shows three infants clinging to his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> figure. She is celestial Charity and her upward glance links her to heaven – the source of her strength as she struggles to fulfil others‘ needs. The three children probably represent Faith, Hope and Love, all of whom need Charity to pave their way to heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In response to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E37-0008-0000-0000.htm">Protestant Reformation</a> there was a resurgence of Catholicism, known as the Counter-Reformation. There was a renewed focus on devotional life and on cultivating a personal relationship with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. Added to this was a growth of mysticism and a widespread cult of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. Here, Charity is clothed in white, symbolising purity. The deep blue cloak billowing behind her is painted in shades of ultramarine, the colour traditionally associated with the Virgin. The radiant blue and the earthy red colour of the satin fabric over Charity’s knees perhaps represent the sought-after link between earth and heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck painted the picture shortly after his return from a long stay in Venice, where he came under the influence of his contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guido Reni</a> and the great Renaissance artist  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>. The rich colours of Titian are evident in the lustrous drapery, although it’s thought that they have changed over time and were once a little more subdued. From Reni, Van Dyck has taken the device of the upward glance towards heaven. Two of Reni’s paintings using this device are in the National Gallery’s collection. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a></span>, it’s the glance of a penitent longing for heavenly forgiveness; in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D6O-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Rape of Europa</a></span>, the nymph may look for a rescuer, though the small Cupid aiming his arrow at her heart suggests that she will no longer want to escape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unusually, Van Dyck painted the image on an oak panel; most of his pictures – especially portraits – were painted on canvas. The wooden support enabled him to paint fluently, particularly on the strong modelling of the infants’ rounded forms and the folds of the white drapery. These were blended from the light to the shadows leaving almost no brushmarks, achieving a surface as smooth and luminous as enamel. This finish may well have been at the request of the person who commissioned the work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was engraved by Cornelis van Caukercken shortly after Van Dyck’s death. It was widely disseminated, perhaps helping to account for the great popularity of the image at the time.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two women in this portrait, Dorothy and Elizabeth, were the eldest surviving daughters of Thomas, 1st Viscount Savage. It was once thought that the picture was painted around the time of Dorothy’s scandalous elopement in 1637, and that she was the sister seated on the right, receiving the roses that were an attribute of her namesake, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Dorothy</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At this time there was strong anti-Catholic feeling in England, and a contemporary account states that ‘Lord Andover had been married to Lady Dorothy Savage by a Catholic priest without the knowledge of their parents, that his father and mother were consequently "in great affliction" and that Lady Savage "pretends a great displeasure"'. It was even rumoured that Dorothy had converted to Catholicism. Elizabeth was included in the gossip as she had also been married by a Catholic priest, to Lord Thimbleby. But it was in fact the Savage family who were Catholic and Lord Andover, a Protestant, who had married without his parents’ permission.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This theory and the attendant rumours have now been disproved. A contemporary copy of the painting has descended through the Savage family, bearing inscriptions that identify Dorothy as the sister standing on the left. Elizabeth wears a saffron-coloured gown – at the time, it was believed that this was the colour worn by brides in ancient Greece. Elizabeth is the newly-wed receiving roses from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, the god of erotic love, and the flowers become a symbol of love and not that of a saint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> was largely responsible for introducing the double or ‘friendship’ portrait to Britain, and this picture is likely to have been entirely by his hand without studio assistants. The informal composition and quantities of shimmering silk perfectly illustrate the appeal of Van Dyck’s new style to aristocratic British patrons eager for innovation. The wide, deep necklines of their dresses reveal the smooth skin of each woman’s décolletage, and their necks are encircled with pearls. The strong colour of Elizabeth’s gown is softened by the deep warm brown of her shawl. Dorothy adjusts her own shawl over her shoulder, revealing a long gold chain over her arm and across her body. Both women have their hair dressed in the height of fashion, with ringlets and corkscrew curls over the forehead and brushing their cheeks. There is a strong family likeness: both women have large brown eyes and long faces with full, pink cheeks and rounded chins.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But the faces of the sisters hardly bear witness to a celebration of wedded harmony. Both appear disengaged and distant, if not outright unhappy; Elizabeth’s hand holding the rose almost seems to crush it. The background too, seems unpromising, with heavy, grey clouds overshadowing a garden revealed by a dark green curtain that is drawn back awkwardly, displaying inelegant, angular folds.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This imposing, life-size double portrait shows the youngest of the seven sons of the 3rd Duke of Lennox: Lord John Stuart, on the left, with his brother Lord Bernard Stuart, later Earl of Lichfield. The two young men – they were probably aged 17 and 18 at the time – ooze aristocratic superiority. There is nothing natural or spontaneous about their poses; they are instead the embodiment of affectation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One brother, leaning nonchalantly on a stone parapet, does not even deign to notice us. The other glances down over his shoulder, lifting his cloak to reveal its fabulous silver lining and to emphasise the tip of his elbow, which juts out directly at the viewer in a distinctly unwelcoming way. In fact, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> seems to have been so concerned with underlining this passive-aggressive gesture that, in order to point the elbow as directly as possible towards us, he has ignored anatomical accuracy: the young man’s upper left arm emerges in a very unnatural way from his shoulder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We tend to overlook this distortion because our eye is distracted by the confidence – or arrogance – of the poses and by the brothers’ extravagant lace-trimmed costumes. Van Dyck’s ability to evoke the sheen and textures of silk and satin on such a large scale was one of the reasons his portraits were so popular with the British aristocracy at the time. Here he has enhanced the effects further by using the clear, simple angular lines and muted colours of the background as a foil for the folds, curves and rich colours of the fabrics.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck was also admired for the way he was able to suggest the relationships between his sitters as well as their characters. In this picture, he has created an interesting tension. The brothers stand close to each other, their postures overlapping, each with his left hand on his hip and his torso turned towards the other. But their eyes do not meet. One leans back rather passively, apparently lost in thought. The other, who looks directly at the viewer, takes an active step forward, his spurs and sword clearly on display. Even their clothes suggest opposites – blue and yellow are complementary (strongly contrasting) colours, while silver and gold clearly evoke very different metals.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait may have been commissioned as a remembrance of the two brothers before they set out on a journey to Europe. We know that they were granted a licence to travel overseas for up to three years on 30 January 1639, with six servants and £100 in cash. However, no other records of their trip have survived and we cannot be completely sure that they made the trip. This was a time of increasing political tensions between the king, Charles I, and Parliament. By 1642 civil war had broken out. As distant cousins of Charles, who was, like them, a descendent of the House of Stuart (or Stewart), the Lennoxes were loyal to the crown. Both brothers were later killed fighting on the Royalist side. Lord John died of his wounds after the battle of Cheriton in 1644 and Bernard died at Rowton-Heath in 1645.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The glorious colours in this portrait are equalled by the delicacy and sensitivity with which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> has captured an intimate moment between us and an unknown woman and her little boy. She looks out at us with a shy half-smile that seems to invite us to share in her pride in the child.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The woman wears the formal clothing of an affluent bourgeois wife: a black silk dress with an elaborate gold stomacher, and fine lace and jewellery at her wrist. The enormous, exaggerated ruff round her neck was worn in the Netherlands long after it had become outdated in the rest of Europe. The child has a miniature version round his neck, keeping to the older tradition as well. It’s the hat that marks him as a boy; voluminous skirts were standard for all children. Boys were formally ‘breeched’ (dressed in a form of trousers called breeches) around the age of five. At this point, a father would become more involved in his child’s upbringing. It’s thought that the boy’s gaze and vivacious gesture towards the left may suggest that there was once a portrait of the father that would have hung next to this one, but which is now lost.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck’s use of colour and texture in this painting is superb. The sheen of the woman’s black satin is rich and intense. The white of her ruff seems to make her pale skin glow and the interlaced pattern of hands foreshadows Van Dyck’s later preoccupation with the portrayal of long, slender fingers. The child’s sleeves are decorated with gold filigree feathers that echo the gold of his mother’s stomacher, and his lace cuffs rival hers for fineness. The soft lilac colour of his skirts is unusual and striking, and the mother catches up one corner of his white pinafore to show it off to advantage – perhaps to demonstrate that no expense has been spared in her little one’s attire. Behind the couple, a curtain is lifted to show a grey sky with a glimmer of light that throws the minimal landscape into silhouette. But the curtain is a deep, opulent crimson, just enough to enrich the picture and give it sparkle. It lifts the image and balances the whites, which would otherwise be too glaring.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During his early career, Van Dyck lived in Antwerp. He painted some of his least formal portraits in the city, mostly – like this one – of the bourgeois citizens and their families (<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Cornelis van Geest</a></span>, a subtle and sympathetic study of an old man, is also in the National Gallery’s collection).

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cornelis van der Geest was one of the most prominent art collectors of his day, so this commission must have been extremely important to Anthony van Dyck, who was only 21 at the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He has taken a relatively conservative approach, using a traditional format: a close up of just the sitter’s face, framed by a white ruff. But his brushwork is virtuosic. For the hair and beard he employed long, wispy strokes, while elsewhere he used much thicker paint – to add texture to the edges of the ruff, for example. The moisture in the sitter’s eyes is evoked with delicate flecks of white. The positioning of van der Geest’s head and gaze is also subtly effective. He looks very slightly back at us, as though he has just reacted to our presence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was later extended, almost certainly not by van Dyck, to bust length, and showed part of the sitter’s hand. The large frame now covers the additions.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait was made in about 1620, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> was only 21 years old – the rising star of his generation, and soon to become one of the best-known portrait painters in Europe. The sitter, on the other hand, is Cornelis van der Geest, who was 65 and a grand old man of the arts.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A prosperous and influential Antwerp spice merchant, van der Geest was one of the most prominent collectors of paintings of his day. He was so revered that Van Dyck’s famous teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> described him as ‘the best of men and my oldest friend, who, since my youth, has been my never-failing patron, whose whole life showed a love and admiration of painting’. And if we doubted Rubens’s word, a painting of the interior of van der Geest’s house in 1615 by Willem van Haecht (now in the Rubenshuis, Antwerp) shows his extensive collection of pictures by some of the most important Flemish artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So for the young Van Dyck, in the early stages of a career in portrait painting, a commission from such an influential patron must have been extremely important. He certainly rises to the occasion, though not by showing off a radically new approach to the composition, as some young artists might have done. Instead he has taken – or perhaps van der Geest asked him to take – a relatively conservative approach using a traditional format: a close up of the sitter’s face framed by a white ruff. What sets the painting apart is Van Dyck’s virtuoso brushwork.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For the hair and beard he employed long, wispy strokes, while elsewhere he used much thicker paint – to add texture to the edges of the ruff, for example, or for the edges of the lower eye lids, which are modelled in three dimensions with thick ridges of paint. The moisture in van der Geest’s eyes is evoked with delicate flecks of white paint. The positioning of van der Geest’s head and gaze is also subtly effective. He looks very slightly back and down at us, enhancing the illusion that he has reacted to the viewer and that we are encountering a real person.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture we see today is somewhat different to what left Van Dyck’s workshop. X-ray photographs show that, instead of the plain dark background, the portrait was originally set in a simulated oval frame painted to look as though it were made of porphyry (a type of red stone). This was a device which Van Dyck used in at least one other picture around this time (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Man</span>, Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts, Brussels). Part of the white ruff has also been painted over by a later hand; it was originally higher at the back, up around the level of his right eye on one side and above his ear on the other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Probably less than 15 years after it was made, new pieces of oak were added to the sides and bottom, and the painting was extended into a bust-length portrait which also showed his left arm. This extension was almost certainly not done by Van Dyck. The large frame now covers the additions so that they are not apparent.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this lively, informal portrait, Anthony van Dyck presents to us someone he had known for several years and whose company he clearly enjoyed.

He has dressed up for the picture, playing the part of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">savoyard</span> – a wandering shepherd and musician – with his cocked hat, an instrument tucked under his arm and a sparkle in his eyes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck has portrayed his friend with great affection and with none of the flattery he used on the English aristocrats at the court of King Charles I.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this lively, informal portrait, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> presents to us someone he had known for several years and whose company he clearly enjoyed. François Langlois was an engraver, art dealer and publisher who lived in Florence and Rome in the 1620s. It’s at that time that he must have met Van Dyck, on the artist’s first trip to Italy, although the picture was painted in the 1630s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Langlois was also an accomplished amateur musician. He has dressed up for the picture, playing the part of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">savoyard</span> – a wandering shepherd and musician – with his cocked hat, a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">musette de cour</span> tucked under his arm and a sparkle in his eyes. His long-snouted dog gazes up at him, but whether he is a dog borrowed for the occasion or Langlois’s own pet, we don’t know. The deep red of Langlois’s costume makes his weather-beaten skin glow and the white of the sleeve and the fragment of shirt at his neck bring brilliance to the image.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">musette de cour</span> is a small bagpipe, with a quiet tone similar to an oboe. It originated as a folk instrument but was taken up by the French royal court. It featured in grander musical entertainments, especially in scenes set in the fashionable <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3D-0008-0000-0000.htm">Arcadian</a> style, in which aristocratic actors and musicians took the part of humble rustic characters against an idyllic background. With the bellows strapped over his white sleeve, Langlois’s fingers already feeling for the finger holes on the chanter, he glances away to the left, smiling an encouraging smile, as if waiting for other musicians to be ready to play.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This image shows quite a different relationship from the formal one Van Dyck had with aristocratic sitters at the opulent and elegant court of Charles I. He has portrayed his friend with great affection and with no attempt at the flattery he used on his English courtiers. Langlois is totally at ease, engrossed in the performance that is about to begin. Set against the sky and a rural landscape, he is himself like a breath of fresh air. Despite Van Dyck’s change of circumstances and his elevation to a knighthood by Charles I, his friendship with Langlois must have continued, as Langlois acted as an agent, acquiring paintings on behalf of the king and other English collectors from his home in Paris.</p></div>

It is the only clue to the identity of the depicted man. Recent genealogical research identifies him as Giovanni Battista Cattaneo Della Volta (1578–1640) of Genoa, son of Filippo Cattaneo di Isnardo (d. 1597), who had a successful career as a merchant in Antwerp while leaving his wife and family in Genoa. Not much is known about Giovanni Battista’s life, who was one of Filippo’s three illegitimate sons born in the southern Netherlands. He lived in Genoa by 1594 and might have followed his father in pursuing a business career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Cattaneos were a rich and powerful Genoese family who included doges, cardinals, scholars, and statesmen. Giovanni Battista’s relatives commissioned a series of family portraits from Van Dyck, probably including <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GD2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Woman</a></span> and the much admired whole-length portrayals of his stepsister-in-law, Elena Grimaldi Cattaneo, and her two children (National Gallery of Art, Washington). The secret sale of the family portraits in 1907 and their export from Italy led to a scandal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting’s condition is compromised. There is reason to believe that it had been formerly enlarged and subsequently reduced in size. Recent conservation revealed the large extent of repaint and the remains of the original costume, including a fur lined cloak wrapped round the sitter’s body, but its rendering is now difficult to appreciate. The work displays stylistic qualities that seem to betray the hand of Van Dyck himself.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central figure in this work is George Gage (about 1582–1638), an English Catholic, art dealer and political agent in the 1620s, acting for King James I and then Charles I. Both he and Van Dyck lived together in the same house in Rome in 1621 and 1622, and it is highly likely that the painting was made then.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck has depicted Gage as an elegant figure negotiating with a dealer in classical antiques. The dealer looks intently at him as he gestures towards the sculpture. While Gage may look diffident, he returns his gaze and seems about to speak. The black figure in the background looks across them and directly at us. He holds the sculpture and is also pointing at it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We could interpret this in different ways. He may be indicating the significance of the piece, or perhaps he is trying to tempt us as prospective purchasers. Either way, we feel drawn into the negotiations.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A clue to the identity of the central figure in this painting lies in the carvings on the antique stone fragment – probably the top of a marble altar – against which he leans so nonchalantly. We can make out the top half of a coat of arms, divided in quarters with a saltire (X-shaped cross), next to a ’sun in splendour' (surrounded by stylised rays). This can be identified as the arms of the Gage family, from Firle in East Sussex; the ram’s head on the corner of the fragment belongs to the family crest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a portrait of George Gage (about 1582–1638), an English Catholic priest, notable connoisseur of art and a political agent sent to Rome in 1621 by King James I to try to negotiate the Pope’s dispensation for the marriage of his son, the future Charles I, to the Spanish infanta, Maria Anna. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> lived together with Gage in the same house in Rome in 1621 and 1622, and it is highly likely that the painting was made then. Despite six years of trying, Gage’s negotiations with the pope failed and he concentrated on another of his specialities, acquiring paintings and antique sculptures for the great English collectors of the early seventeenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck has depicted Gage as a nonchalant English gentleman at ease in what may be intended to represent the portico of a classical villa in Rome. The man on the right, presumably a salesman who deals in antiquities, is clearly trying to interest Gage – looking intently at him as he gestures towards the sculpture. Gage may look diffident, but he returns his gaze and seems about to speak. The black figure in the background is looking across them and directly at us; he holds the sculpture and is also pointing at it. We could interpret this in different ways: he may be indicating the significance of the piece, or perhaps he is trying to tempt us as prospective purchasers. Either way, we feel drawn into the negotiations.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Multiple changes in the composition reveal that the young Van Dyck took great care in developing this portrait of his friend: an irregularly shaped strip of canvas was sewn on to the main piece at the right-hand side later in the painting process; a draped curtain was replaced by architecture; and the faces of all three men and the costume of the attendant on the right were altered. Although no technical evidence has been found conclusively to support the idea, it nevertheless seems that some changes – especially in the figure on the right – date from after Van Dyck’s lifetime.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture has a significant place in the history of art collecting in Britain. Once believed to show a portrait of Peter Paul Rubens, it was owned by the great eighteenth-century artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir Joshua Reynolds</a> before being bought by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T0D-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Julius Angerstein</a>. After Angerstein’s death, 38 of his pictures were bought by the British government to form the founding collection of the National Gallery in 1824.</p></div>

The rose – traditionally a nuptial flower – tucked over her ear accentuates her beauty and might suggest that this engaging young woman is married.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting came from the collection of the prominent Cattaneo family in Genoa and was in 1907 acquired as a companion piece to Van Dyck’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G4F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Giovanni Battista Cattaneo</a></span>, which is also in the National Gallery’s collection. The woman was then assumed to represent the wife of the male sitter. However, pendant portraits of husband and wife in this period were almost invariably painted with the sitters facing each other, so it is highly unlikely that these paintings were conceived as a pair. What is more, Giovanni Battista Cattaneo Della Volta (1574–1649) was never married.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Genealogical research now suggests that the woman in this portrait is a different member of the Cattaneo family from Genoa. She might be Giovanni Battista Cattaneo Della Volta’s cousin, Isabella Cattaneo Della Volta Imperiale (about 1600 – after 1647), who had married Francesco Imperiale di Nicolò (d. after 1647) in 1619 and would have been in her mid-twenties at the time her portrait was painted. She is drawing attention to her long gold necklace with her right hand, which might be a play on the family name, as Cattaneo phonetically recalls catena, the Italian word for chain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is not signed and some parts are in a compromised state of preservation, which makes an attribution more uncertain. But the style and quality of the painting are such that it was Van Dyck himself who painted the portrait during his time in Italy. Recent technical analysis revealed several pentimenti strengthening the attribution, while conservation treatment confirmed the irreversible loss of traces indicating how the black costume was originally decorated with elaborate ornamentation made of gold or silver thread, similar to what can be seen in other Genoese portraits by Van Dyck.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Abbot Scaglia (1592–1641), whose full name was Cesare Alessandro Scaglia di Verrua, was a cleric and diplomat well known in Rome, Madrid, London and Paris for his service to the House of Savoy and Philip IV of Spain. Scaglia was also an art collector of renown who knew, among others, Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens and Velázquez. After they met in the 1620s, Scaglia became one of Van Dyck’s most important patrons.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this portrait, painted in Antwerp in 1634 when Scaglia was 42, Van Dyck shows him as a living statue, his pose and toga-like robes recalling Roman sculptures. Atop a body elongated to give elegance and life sits the head of a man who has seen much of life. He is a formidable figure used to moving in the highest echelons of court circles, whose expression, hard to read, nevertheless confirms Rubens’s estimation of him as ‘a man of the keenest intellect’.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is Cesare Alessandro Scaglia di Verrua (1592–1641), the second son of a count. He initially trained for the church and although he never took holy orders he nevertheless received income from various abbeys. The Abbot’s real career was as a diplomat; he served as ambassador for the House of Savoy in Rome, Paris and Madrid, and went on to become a diplomat and possibly a spy in the courts of Europe. As the Duke of Savoy’s ambassador to the Vatican, he tried and failed to be made a cardinal. In 1624 he moved to Paris; by 1626 he was in London; in 1627 he was in the Low Countries; and in 1628 in Spain. For nearly a decade, between 1629 and 1637, he moved around the courts of Europe with Brussels and then Antwerp as his base. His diplomatic career served as cover for his secondary role as a gatherer of intelligence for the Duke of Savoy and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain</a>, and he was known in official documents as ‘Agent 2X’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Scaglia, an ambitious, intelligent and subtle man, was also an art collector and patron of long standing who knew some of the greatest painters of the age; not just <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jordaens</a>, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velázquez</a>, with whom he travelled from Madrid to Genoa in 1629. He was also friendly with the English architect and cultural adviser to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles I</a>, Inigo Jones, and undertook art-buying expeditions for the king.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck was another well-travelled figure, and he and Scaglia might have met as early as 1623 in Turin. The Abbot became one of his most important patrons and their relationship continued to the late 1630s. Scaglia’s will shows that he owned at least seven paintings, and possibly as many as ten, by Van Dyck – a mixture of portraits, religious works and a mythological scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck’s portrait shows Abbot Scaglia as a somewhat severe figure leaning against a column, his ecclesiastical robes mimicking the togas of Roman statues. Preparatory drawings indicate that Van Dyck initially intended to show Scaglia seated but changed his mind (the chair remains in the background). His elongated pose gives him real presence and the painter imparts a sense of life and movement through the slight twist to the head, the lean into the column and the hands held at different levels. Van Dyck enlivens the severity of the Abbot’s black garb through the elegance of his hands and the way he lifts the hem of his robe just enough to show his shoes poking out. The dark ‘halo’ around Scaglia’s head is the dark background to Van Dyck’s initial head study, which is now emerging through the paint. Meanwhile, the eye contact Scaglia makes with the viewer confirms Rubens’s assessment of him as ‘a man of the keenest intellect’. Van Dyck agrees: here is a man to be reckoned with.</p></div>

The scene shows a tender moment: from his position on her lap, Rinaldo looks up adoringly at Armida, who tends to her long golden hair and glances toward an upheld mirror.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lovers' idyll is about to be disturbed. Armida’s mirror will soon reflect two advancing intruders, whose Spanish-style helmets are just visible behind the bush on the left. These are Rinaldo’s comrades, Carlo and Ubaldo, who compel him to return to fighting in the First Crusade (a Christian military campaign to recapture Jerusalem from Islamic rule).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an episode from Torquato Tasso’s epic <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Gerusalemme liberate</span> (1581), which, through Edward Fairfax’s English translation (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Jerusalem Delivered</span>, 1600), was particularly popular during the early seventeenth century. The tale of bewitchment and love on a ‘Fortunate Isle’ captured the imagination of the English royal court, and a large painting of an earlier episode of the story by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> (thought to be the picture now at the Baltimore Museum of Art) was acquired by King Charles I.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The present picture is a reduced <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a> copy of a painting now in the Louvre, Paris. It has been suggested that the squared-up, grey, yellow and greenish grisaille might be a preparatory study for the finished painting, but it is more likely to be a model for the subsequent engraving of it produced by Pieter de Jode (1644), which is of exactly the same dimensions. Indeed, this copy and the engraving show more of the landscape at the top and bottom of the composition than the Louvre painting, suggesting that it has at some stage been cut down.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is most likely that this copy was made from the original painting while it was in Van Dyck’s workshop in Antwerp, or possibly from another copy soon after. It then apparently remained unused until it became the basis for the 1644 print. Several documentary references suggest that there existed another oil sketch of the subject of the story of Rinaldo and Armida, now lost.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was once owned by the leading portrait painter of Regency London and fourth President of the Royal Academy of Arts, Sir Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830).</p></div>

Van Dyck worked in Rubens’s studio as his assistant, and was heavily influenced by the older artist.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Emperor Theodosius (about 346–395) – the figure in a red cape, laurel wreath and armour – is being blocked from entering Milan Cathedral by the bishop of the city, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Ambrose</a>. Theodosius had massacred the people of Thessalonica for their role in the murder of his general, Butheric, so the saint banned him from the cathedral.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This encounter is recorded in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, a medieval compilation of saints‘ lives. In this painting, the Emperor is accompanied by three soldiers. One of them, on the far left, wears a haughty expression and holds an arrogant pose; the dog at his feet identifies him as Ruffinus, to whom Saint Ambrose declared: ’Thou hast no more shame than a hound.' The rebuke is intensified by the saint’s gaze, which is focused on Ruffinus rather than Theodosius, who stands immediately in front of him and is the subject of the story. Like the Emperor, Saint Ambrose is surrounded by a group of supporters. The man second from the right, whose face is most clearly detailed and illuminated, has been identified as Nicholaes Rockox, alderman of Antwerp. Rockox commissioned <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Samson and Delilah</a></span> from Rubens and may have also commissioned this picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> based his depiction of the story on a version of the same subject by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, dated to around 1615–16 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). Van Dyck worked as an assistant in Rubens’s studio around 1618–20, and he drew much influence and inspiration from the older artist. He brought his own imaginative flare to his pictures, however, and there are significant differences between this painting and Rubens’s original. This version is less than half the size of the original, and Van Dyck also made changes to the composition. He extended the architecture, bringing it further forward so that it dominates the background and pushes the figures together, giving the scene a more immediate sense of confrontation. Some of the figures’ facial features have also been altered: in the National Gallery picture, the Emperor and his followers are beardless, unlike in Rubens’s version.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck made several of these changes while he was painting. He had begun by following Rubens’s original more closely, but altered details as he progressed to infuse the picture with his own distinctive character. Some of these pentimenti can be seen with the naked eye and some can be seen in X-ray and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared</a> images taken of the painting.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Abbot Scaglia (1592–1641), cleric, diplomat, spy and one of Van Dyck’s most important patrons, commissioned this painting while suffering from ill health and in a reflective state of mind. It was meant for the church of the Recollect order of Augustinians in Antwerp; within a few years Scaglia would withdraw from public life and retire to their monastery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture shows the Abbot kneeling before the Virgin and Child and receiving a blessing from the infant Christ, who seems to have paused momentarily from squirming playfully in his mother’s lap. The informality of Christ and the joyous colours contrast with the seriousness of Scaglia, intent on the salvation of his soul, and the calm gravity of the Virgin. Her face, double chin and all, appears to be a portrait, the most likely candidate being Princess Henrietta of Lorraine Phalsbourg, to whom Scaglia bequeathed the picture. Van Dyck has made a scene where the human and the divine interact with touching naturalness.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cesare Alessandro Scaglia di Verrua was born in 1592 and, after entering the Church, served the House of Savoy as a diplomat. At the time this painting was made, Scaglia was largely living in the Low Countries but was in poor health, which undoubtedly directed his thoughts increasingly towards God and the state of his soul. He was drawn to the religious community of the Rýcollets, or Recollects, in Antwerp and would later retire to their monastery where he would die in 1641. This painting, which Scaglia commissioned from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a>, was for their church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of the Adoration already had a long tradition in art and Van Dyck, a much travelled painter, would have seen numerous examples both in the Low Countries and in Italy, many being formal compositions in which the donor is a static bystander. Van Dyck was always concerned that his paintings – whether portraits or religious works – should have a sense of life and movement, and for Scaglia’s picture he took as his model a now lost version of the subject painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> which he had sketched while in Italy. It too showed the Christ Child sitting in his mother’s lap and blessing the donor. Van Dyck had a rare gift for painting children which was to come to the fore in his portraits of the family of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles I</a>, and his Christ Child is very much a living and breathing infant.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At first glance it looks almost as if Scaglia is tickling the Child’s feet since the infant sprawls in his mother’s lap in a pose of playful relaxation. In fact Christ is making the sign of benediction, blessing the Abbot and so ensuring his path into heaven. Curiously perhaps, Scaglia’s gaze is not directed at the blessing hand, or even at Christ’s face, but rather towards the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a>. She, in turn, gazes out of the painting towards the viewer, drawing us into this holy triangle and moment of religious drama. At the centre of the painting is a cluster of hands, a point at which all three figures seem on the verge of touching, that could almost be a still life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin herself is not an idealised figure but has specific features, including a double chin, that suggests she is a portrait. Proposed models for her have included the Duchess of Aremberg; Christine of France, Duchess of Savoy; and Marie-Claire de Croÿ, Duchess of Havré. Perhaps the most likely candidate is Henrietta of Lorraine Phalsbourg, since Scaglia bequeathed the painting to her and Van Dyck painted a full-length portrait of her around the same time as this commission.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For a religious work the painting has a joyous sense of colour: Van Dyck contrasts the Abbot’s sombre clothes with the vivid blues and reds worn by the Virgin, the green of the background drapery, and the blue and white of the sky, with a yellow tint in the clouds showing the end of the day, a metaphor for the declining years of Scaglia’s life. Analysis of the colours shows that the blue contains a high percentage of lapis lazuli, a very expensive mineral <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> – testament to Scaglia’s desire that in his search for salvation his painter should spare no expense.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A more formal <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1H-0001-0000-0000.htm">full-length portrait of the Abbot</a> by Van Dyck, also in the National Gallery’s collection, was probably painted shortly before this one.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three dashing young boys stand on the steps of an impressive building, with classical columns behind them and velvet drapery looped up like a curtain drawn up to reveal them in all their finery. During the six years <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> spent in Italy (1621–27) he frequently stayed in Genoa, where he received many portrait commissions from the city’s elite. He painted his sitters in luxurious settings, often flattering them, and introduced a new style of portraiture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The boys were long believed to represent the Balbi children because the painting was once in the collection of the wealthy ​Balbi family ​in Genoa. But new research suggests these boys belonged to another prominent Genoese family: they are in fact Alessandro (1617–1674), Vincenzo (1619 – after 1690) and Francesco Maria (1624 – after 1651) Giustiniani Longo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The three brothers wear extremely expensive garments of predominantly Spanish fashion – made of satin, velvet and brocade, decorated with silver and gold braid, with fine linen ruffs, collars and lace cuffs – and they seem full of life, ready to be off at any moment. The youngest boy, Francesco Maria is still dressed in a full-length infant’s dress. Little boys wore them until they were put into breeches at about the age of five. His chubby cheeks and hands also mark him out as an infant, and he clumsily grasps a defenceless bird in his fist.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The middle brother, Vincenzo, places a protective hand around the younger boy’s shoulder. His right hand is on his hip, his hair is fashionably long and casual and he has a faraway look in his eye. His costume was also in vogue: gold frogging across the chest, narrow long breeches and a plain flat linen collar. His pose and dress seem to mark the boy as the stylish second son, with fewer responsibilities than his older brother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Alessandro, the eldest boy, stands a little apart from the others. He carries his dress sword with assurance and is the most ornately but also most traditionally dressed of the three. His costume, consisting of a red doublet decorated with silver thread with a matching cloak, a silver and red cassock, worn on top of the doublet, and matching full-cut puffed and slashed breeches with bright red hose (stockings), is a symbol of his status.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He gestures towards two pet birds on the lowest step – they both originally had a bell attached to one of their legs. They are choughs and were perhaps intended to play a similar role to other tamed birds found in portraits of children, their willingness to learn symbolising a good upbringing and education. Choughs were also renowned for remaining loyal to their mates even after death. As such they may have been intended as a symbol of fidelity. The bird clutched by the youngest child in the centre of the composition perhaps recalls the inscription on an ancient gravestone: ‘Life is like a little bird which is held in the hand of a boy; it often flies off at the very outset'. This could refer to the infant death of the brothers’ sibling, Luciano.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Dyck’s fine highlights and sensitive modelling show us what each bright-eyed boy looked like, but it is his subtle and delicate observation of their movements and interactions that conveys their personalities in a groundbreaking way. He formulated a new style of portraiture that was hugely influential for centuries to come.</p></div>

Known as Rupert of the Rhine, he bears a striking resemblance to his cousin the Prince of Wales, later <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0U15-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles II</a> – the long face, the aquiline nose, the heavy brows and cleft chin. Although he looks directly at us, the portrait is designed to place us at his feet, a technique common in paintings of royalty. But his gaze doesn't seem to engage us – he is above us, a distant being to be admired and revered.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His jacket is plain – a soldier’s garment – but he wears it casually unlaced as was the fashion, in keeping with his unsoldierly but rich satin shirt embellished with gold and lace. Round his neck is the metal gorget of his armour, and other parts of it sit beside him on a high table. The portrait hints of his future: a flamboyant and brave, if sometimes rash, military commander.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was painted by the studio of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> during the Prince’s extended stay at the court of his uncle, Charles I. His father, Frederick V, Elector Palatine and for a brief period, King of Bohemia, his mother Queen Elizabeth, and the rest of their large family settled in Holland after being exiled from Bohemia in 1620. His father died in 1632 and shortly afterwards Rupert accompanied his elder brother Charles Louis, Frederick’s heir, to London, hoping to raise money and support to restore Charles Louis to the throne.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the English Civil War, Rupert fought in the Royalist army as a commander of cavalry. At first he met with great success but later, when he failed to hold the city of Bristol for the King, he was banished and returned to Europe. When Charles II was restored to the throne in 1660, Rupert became squadron commander in the Royal Navy, active in government and a leading member of the London social scene. He was a supporter of art and science and, active as an artist himself, practised the technique of mezzotint, a new and innovative form of printmaking.</p></div>
