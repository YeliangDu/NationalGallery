In fact, the same man seems to have sat as a model in several other works made during this period, and the hat was probably a studio prop.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is not a portrait of an individual person in the way we understand the idea today – the identity of the sitter wouldn‘t have been considered relevant, either to the artist or the person who bought the painting. Instead it falls into the category of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronies</span> (literally ’heads‘). These were understood to represent a ’type‘ of person rather than an individual, and they were valued as a demonstration of the artist’s skill at portraying different characters and particular facial expressions in a convincing way.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is one of a group of such studies, almost certainly made from life, by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> in the 1650s. However, we can’t be absolutely sure of the date of this one. While the first three figures painted onto the canvas are clear (’165‘), the last digit is very faint. It could conceivably be the remains of a 3, but more likely the date is 1657. The free use of the brush, the deep background shadows, the very limited palette of browns and ochres and the way the painter has concentrated on the detail of the face, eyes and beard while only sketching in the rest of the picture are all consistent with Rembrandt’s style for the late 1650s and 1660s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sometime in the mid-nineteenth century the painting was given the title ’A Jewish Rabbi‘, probably because the man’s divided, square-cut beard and his exotic hat, which was not typical of everyday dress at the time, suggest that he might be Jewish. Rembrandt lived near the Jewish quarter of Amsterdam and painted several portraits of Jews, and the same man also seems to have been used by the artist as a model for the so-called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Rabbi</span>, 1657 (Palace of the Legion of Honor, San Francisco). However, there’s no evidence that the title ’A Jewish Rabbi' was used before 1844, when the National Gallery bought the painting. The man also seems to have sat as a model in other works which Rembrandt made during the 1650s and 1660s, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aristotle contemplating the Bust of Homer</span> (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Bearded Man</span> (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg). The hat also seems to be the same one used in other paintings by Rembrandt, including his own <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Self Portrait at the Age of 34</a></span>. Far from being the hat worn by an individual rabbi, it was probably a studio prop used when Rembrandt was trying to evoke a sense of history or exotic dress in a painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting caught the attention of the great eighteenth-century portraitist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Thomas Gainsborough</a>, who made a copy of it in about 1770 (Royal Collection, London).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This man is wearing the habit of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> friar (this order of monks was founded to follow the teachings of Saint <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Francis of Assisi</a>). His pose, eyes cast down and apparently lost in thought, reflects the Franciscan way of life – one of simplicity and prayer. The theme was clearly one which interested <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>. Soon after this, in 1660 and 1661, he made two other paintings of men in Franciscan habits. One – apparently modelled by his son, Titus – is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, the other is in Helsinki. He also made an etching of Saint Francis praying beneath a tree (1657).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This raises an intriguing question. Why, at a time when the Christian religion was sharply polarised, when he was a Protestant living in a Protestant community, would Rembrandt have been interested in a Roman Catholic order such as the Franciscans?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In fact, although Amsterdam was officially Calvinist, and membership of the Church was a requirement of all holders of political office, it was a very diverse community. Other religions were tolerated, Catholics were allowed to practise in ‘private’ and thousands did so. Their churches were disguised behind the facades of ordinary houses. There was even a limited market for art on Catholic themes, although the Franciscan monks are the only such paintings that Rembrandt seems to have produced (he did, however, make at least three etchings which focused on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps his interest was piqued because for the first 25 years of his time in Amsterdam Rembrandt lived very close to two of the largest Franciscan churches in the city. Though they were technically secret, and the friars would not normally have worn their habits in public, it is extremely unlikely that Rembrandt would have been unaware of these churches – by 1652 as many as 2,000 people were attending services each week.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps too, there was something about the Franciscans which intrigued or appealed to Rembrandt. He may have known some of the friars as friends. His interest may also have been related to his own difficult financial circumstances during the 1650s. In 1656, around the time that this painting was made, Rembrandt was forced into bankruptcy and by 1661 he had to move to a much smaller house on the other side of the city. A philosophy devoted to poverty and a simple life may have offered the embattled painter some consolation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But while these are all reasons which might help explain the choice of subject, there is still something of a mystery about who or what Rembrandt is actually painting here. This may be a portrait of an individual friar, or perhaps a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span> – a genre of painting depicting interesting character types instead of identifiable individuals. Pictures of this kind were popular among seventeenth-century buyers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is also conceivable, as some have argued, that Rembrandt meant this friar to represent Saint Francis himself. But this seems much less likely, as he has chosen to hide the characteristic which was traditionally used to identify the saint – the stigmata. These are the wounds which Christ suffered on the Cross and with which Saint Francis was later miraculously afflicted. They were on his hands, feet and chest, and, because of the pose Rembrandt has chosen, cannot be seen in this painting.</p></div>

Perhaps the painting was a homage to her strength and loyalty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that the picture is a study for a biblical heroine in a much larger picture, but the plain shift the woman wears is enough to raise a doubt: such a heroine would have been richly dressed or nude. The most likely possibility is that Rembrandt knew and loved this quiet, gently absorbed woman and shared her delight in an unguarded moment of pleasure in some anonymous Dutch stream.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is so immediate, so tenderly intimate, that we sense the young woman he depicted was precious to the ageing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>. But he doesn‘t make it easy for us to understand why. We don’t know who she is, where she is and whether the image is posed or something remembered.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mellow light bathes her high forehead and her neck and breast, giving her flesh a soft bloom. Her face is plump and wholesome; her thick auburn hair is caught back but threatens to tumble about her shoulders – a stray ringlet and a tiny earring tickle her cheek. But her sturdy legs and slightly puffed knees, perfectly reflected in the stream, speak of demanding physical work and someone unused to leisure. She looks down with a little smile at the sensation of the water. Tiny ripples bubble against her skin as she wades forward, feeling her way carefully with a foot, lifting her shift in case it should get wet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This shift is quickly painted in thick strokes in many different tones of white, suggesting a coarse fabric such as cambric. Baggy and shapeless, sleeves carelessly rolled back, the low neck slips off the woman’s shoulder, almost revealing her breasts. This isn‘t the garment of a wealthy client perhaps wanting an unconventional portrait, yet behind the woman is a heap of heavy red and gold brocade of some value. Does this belong to her? Is it simply a prop left behind after one of the dressing up sessions for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history painting</a> that Rembrandt was making?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some have suggested that this is a sketch or a study for a painting of a mythological or biblical heroine (Rembrandt painted several of these, but such characters are usually richly dressed or shown nude). The most likely is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bathsheba</a>, the wife of Uriah, a general in the army of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FA0-0008-0000-0000.htm">King David</a>. David saw Bathsheba bathing and desired her. Wanting to marry her himself, David sent her husband into the thick of battle to ensure his death. Sometimes Bathsheba is shown in paintings as a temptress, in others as David’s victim, with no choice but to succumb to him because of his status. Rembrandt chose the second version for his great painting of Bathsheba that is now in the Louvre, Paris.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">What has this to do with the young woman in this picture, seemingly so unaware of her own allure? It has been suggested that this is a preparatory study for Rembrandt’s painting of Bathsheba. Both were painted in the same year, 1654, and both portray a woman in or near water with rich, heavy fabric nearby – Bathsheba sits, the woman here stands. The settings are equally imprecise, dark shadowy places quickly painted and left simply as a background to the figure of the woman. But is it the same woman?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like the image of the unknown woman, Rembrandt’s Bathsheba seems very real, not an imaginary ideal. Although entirely nude, she is physically similar: wide hipped with a rounded belly and small breasts. The women share the same auburn hair, though Bathsheba’s is more artfully arranged and a ribbon brushes her bare shoulder. The faces bear similarities – the high, round foreheads and the noses are alike, although in both cases their lowered eyes can’t be seen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But it appears that whoever she is, the woman in the stream isn't likely to be posing as a historic heroine. It does seem likely that she posed for Bathsheba but at some other time, and that this is not a study for the Louvre painting. The plain cambric shift is enough to raise a doubt. The most likely possibility is that Rembrandt knew and loved this quiet, gently absorbed woman and shared her delight in an unguarded moment of pleasure in some anonymous Dutch stream.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Hendrickje Stoffels came into Rembrandt’s household to look after his infant son after his first wife, Saskia, died. She is thought to have posed for several of his paintings including a portrait, but there is no evidence to confirm this. Although Hendrickje and Rembrandt became lovers, they were unable to marry because, by the terms of Saskia’s will, he would have lost a considerable amount of income if he did so. In the year that this picture was painted, Hendrickje was 28 years old. She had been subjected to public humiliation and was denied the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a> because she had become pregnant outside marriage with their first child, Cornelia. Perhaps the painting was a homage to her strength, endurance and loyalty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Whoever this woman is, Rembrandt’s revolutionary technique – leaving the warm buff colour of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> uncovered in places to create shadows, stroking wet paint into wet rough ridges to create texture – enabled him to do what he did best: portray a deep understanding of human emotions. In this picture, it’s not only the woman’s emotions that we sense, but also, it seems, Rembrandt’s own.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between the late 1650s and early 1660s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> painted a series of intimate half-length pictures of religious figures. He seems to have been particularly fascinated by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Paul</a>, and even painted himself in the guise of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> in 1661 (Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam). Theologians from the various Protestant denominations in Rembrandt’s Holland also actively engaged with Saint Paul, considering him the most important authority for interpreting the Gospel. The Paul we see here is not a self portrait. It has been suggested that the painting is a portrait of a contemporary sitter in the guise of Paul, a so-called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">portrait historié</span>; alternatively, Rembrandt may have used a model instead of creating an imaginative depiction of the apostle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Paul stares outward, the red hat and his distinctive grey hair and beard framing a pensive face. His hands folded in prayer are a prominent feature that lights up the lower half of the picture. The saint’s traditional attributes, just about visible in the darkness, are what identify him: a book sits open on the table in front of him, and the sword of his martyrdom leans against the wall behind, next to a door opening.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On close examination, there’s another detail that identifies this man as Saint Paul. Above the sword, Rembrandt has painted a sculpted bas-relief roundel that depicts Abraham about to sacrifice his son Isaac on God’s instruction. An angel intervenes, preventing the murder. Rembrandt painted this exact moment some decades earlier, in a picture now in the State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg; he also made an etching of the subject in 1655, with which the painted roundel shares some formal similarities. Another roundel appears to the right of Paul here, but it is badly rubbed and we are not sure if it once contained a related episode from the Old Testament. Both roundels were only rediscovered when the picture was cleaned in 1945–6.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Paul praised Abraham’s response to the test of faith in his Epistle to the Hebrews (11: 17–20), and considered Abraham’s faith an example of piety. By including the attempted sacrifice, Rembrandt introduced in his painting what in Christian theology is called typology; that is, relating an Old Testament event or figure to a New Testament one and examining the relationship between the two. El Greco used the sacrifice of Isaac similarly in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DA6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ driving the Traders from the Temple</a></span>, also in the National Gallery’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt’s painting is dominated by dark brown and ochre tones, typical of the master at this stage of his career. The picture is signed and dated to the right of Paul’s head, and although there is some loss here, the last digit is probably a ‘9’, dating the painting to 1659.</p></div>

He painted them as if every etched line, every crooked bone, every little brown mark on every hand were important, badges of their owner’s longevity, experience and wisdom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, a cold, grey light creeps through an open window into a room that is itself very old – no glass in the window, a heavy wooden shutter, an open fire. The shadows are deep. There’s just a glint of light on an earthenware pot tipped on its side and on the back and side of an old man sitting by the window. He sits wrapped in a long robe with a fur collar, the ruffled neck of an old shirt cupping his wrinkled cheek and grey beard. His head is bound in a white headdress with a black cap on top. He is very still: his hands are clasped on his lap and his head lowered as if deep in thought. This is Tobit. An <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO2-0008-0000-0000.htm">apocryphal</a> story tells us that he was a good and holy man, but that God made him blind to test his faith.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tobit’s wife Anna is closer to us but turned away. She looks down at her hands, busy winding wool on a frame, an occupation that requires great patience. The flames from the fire and her fingers are the only things moving. It is as if the whole room is waiting. The ivy clinging at the window suggests endurance, patience – ‘holding on’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The old couple are waiting for their son Tobias, who has gone on a long journey with their dog to find money owed to Tobit in order to ease their poverty. Tobias has many adventures, finds a wife and meets the Archangel Raphael, who helps him fight a huge fish. At last he returns home with the money, the wife, and the fish’s entrails, which prove a cure for Tobit’s blindness – as the Archangel promised.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The tale was popular in Rembrandt’s time. Tobit’s faith was honoured and the Archangel Raphael was venerated as the protector of travellers and as a healer. After the return of a son after a long, dangerous journey, a picture of Tobias and his family could be commissioned as a thanksgiving, as Rembrandt’s painting may have been, although rather than the return of someone loved, the sensitive portrayal of Tobit and Anna celebrates old age, faith and patience.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Belshazzar’s Feast</span> was painted somewhere between 1636 and 1638, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> was about 30 years old. He had to make his way in Amsterdam, a city crowded with artists all vying for a share in its new prosperity and the seemingly insatiable desire of the middle classes for paintings. We don’t know if the picture was commissioned to hang over a rich merchant’s fireplace or whether Rembrandt simply painted it as a way of establishing himself as an outstanding history painter, hoping to go on to more large narrative pictures of episodes from ancient myths or the Bible.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man in the picture wearing a gold cloak with an enormous turban and tiny crown is Belshazzar, King of Babylon. His story is told in the Old Testament (Daniel 5: 1–5, 25–8): Belshazzar’s father, King Nebuchadnezzar, had robbed the Temple of Jerusalem of all its precious, sacred vessels. These ill-gotten gains sit on the table; using them to serve food at a feast, as Belshazzar does, was seen as sacrilege. In the middle of the feast came a clap of thunder, and a hand appeared in a mysterious grey cloud. The hand wrote on the wall in Hebrew script: ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mene, mene tekel upharsin</span>.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Belshazzar sent for the wise men of Babylon to translate the words for him, but they didn’t understand them either. So the Jewish prophet Daniel was brought in. He told the King that the meaning was clear and that there was no escape: ‘You have been weighed in the balance and found wanting.‘ Within hours, Belshazzar was dead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Deep shadows and shafts of brilliant light capture the drama: the sharp intake of breath from the people at the feast, the rattle of Belshazzar’s chain, the clank of metal as he upsets a dish and the splash of wine as the gold goblets tip over. Rich textures that suggest the opulence of the gathering glow in the candlelight: sumptuous furs and long, silky hair; pearls and velvet; creamy lace and soft flesh. Belshazzar’s cloak, with its exquisite embroidery and intricately jewelled clasp, almost weighs down his out-thrust arm, making it seem weak and useless against the might of God’s message up above.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The expressions on the faces of the onlookers – wide, fearful eyes, gaping mouths – and the figures tipping away from the bright light all heap up the drama. Who is looking at who? Can they see the message or just the back of the King’s head? Do they know what has frightened him? Although it’s a large picture, Rembrandt has made the figures fill the canvas. We look down on the scene almost as if we’re part of it, with a bird’s eye view of the woman spilling her wine on the right. In this way, Rembrandt has created a claustrophobic atmosphere that accentuates the feeling of there being no escape – which we share.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Why didn’t the wise men of Babylon understand the writing on the wall? It was written in Hebrew, a language they would have known, and which is read from right to left. Rembrandt’s neighbour and friend, a Jewish scholar named Menasseh ben Israel, published his interpretation of the letters. According to him, the Hebrew letters had been written from top to bottom as well as right to left, thus confusing the wise men. In the painting, Rembrandt followed Menasseh’s formula.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt called in friends and family to pose for him, and they dressed up in exotic clothes to model as the different characters, as they often did for his paintings. The man posing as Belshazzar appears in several of his other paintings. He wears very similar garments in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Man in Oriental Costume (’The Noble Slav')</span> (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which was not a portrait, but a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span>, a type of painting popular in seventeenth-century Holland, showing an exaggerated facial expression or a stock character in costume. This man was perfect for the overindulged, slack-jawed King Belshazzar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For the woman next to the King – her eyes wide with shock, pearls a little askew, twisting anxious fingers – Rembrandt probably used his first wife Saskia as his model. You can see her in another picture in the National Gallery’s collection painted about the same time as this one – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saskia van Uylenburgh in Arcadian Costume</a></span> – in which she probably represents Flora, the Roman goddess of spring.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt’s Amsterdam was a Calvinist (a strict form of Protestantism) city. Churches were plain, but people had pictures, some of them religious, in their homes. Encouraged to read the Bible, they would have been familiar with Belshazzar’s fate and with the cautionary message of the story of a wicked king watched by heavenly eyes – like the piercing eyes of the recorder player looking out from the shadows.</p></div>

It’s a critical point in the story of the events leading to Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a> – the moment when he is left alone and isolated, spurned and condemned by his own people.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pilate, here shown wearing a turban and rising to his feet, is presenting Christ to the crowd. He rejects the long rod of justice the Jewish elders are offering him, his indication that there is no fault for which he can find Christ guilty. But as a seventeenth-century audience would have known, the priests – depicted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> as ugly caricatures clamouring at Pilate’s feet – continued to accuse Jesus of claiming to be ’King of the Jews‘ and the crowd demanded his crucifixion. ’We have no king but Caesar!‘ was their chant, a sentiment Rembrandt has echoed visually with a monumental bust of Tiberius Caesar that towers over the right-hand side of the scene. The hand of the clock behind him points to six, the time specified in the Bible (John 19: 14), which goes on to tell of Pilate’s weakness and his agreement to Christ’s crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture evokes the fevered atmosphere of this show trial and is dominated by images of earthly power and authority: soldiers, priests, judges, the emperor and the mob. But Christ has an air of detachment, despite the bindings, the crown of thorns that has been mockingly placed on his head and the sharp blades of the soldiers’ spears that stand threateningly behind his head. He is slightly higher than his captors, and is the only figure looking upwards towards the ’true' judge, God.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small black and white painting (known as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a>) was not made for sale. It is a full-scale preparatory study for one of Rembrandt’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGD-0008-0000-0000.htm">etchings</a> – the only known example of such a work. The painting, which is on paper, was laid onto the etching plate, onto which the design was traced with a stylus. A print – a mirror image of the study – would be made from that. Indentations made during this tracing process are visible in the outlines of the key figures and features, and are especially clear around the clock tower. Despite the lack of colour (which wasn’t necessary for an etching) Rembrandt has focused considerable attention on Pilate and the priests in the foreground. He has used thick layers of paint and white highlights to capture the raking light on their exotic costumes and anxious expressions. Much of the rest of the painting, especially on the right side, has been only lightly sketched in. More detail was added to the final etching.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt was a prolific print maker and his studio produced hundreds of images for sale. This was one of his most popular and by the eighteenth century it had become known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Thirty Guilder Print</span>’, reflecting the high price paid for impressions of it.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The optical illusion created by this painting, is a powerful one. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> has used contrasts between light and dark – for example, the blacks and whites of the sitter’s clothes, the highlights on her nose, the heavy shadow under her chin and the lighter, subtle greys of her headdress – to create a highly convincing three-dimensional effect. The old lady’s head seems to project forward out of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But it isn’t only the light effects which make the portrait seem so lifelike. Rembrandt has evoked the old lady’s blotched, blemished and sagging skin using different textures and thicknesses of paint. The furrows and shadows, the wrinkles and pudginess make her face seem almost tangible. He did this with a lively brush, applying the paint fluidly with short and curving strokes, as well as dabs and stipples.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was made when Rembrandt was 28 years old, soon after he arrived in Amsterdam to set up his own studio. The oval shape was conventional in the city at that time, but the energetic and creative way of applying paint to the canvas represents a significant change in Rembrandt’s style from his more smoothly painted portraits of only a year or two earlier. He was clearly excited by the possibilities of his art and keen to experiment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting does not record the sitter’s name, though it does give her age (83), as well as the date it was made (1634) and Rembrandt’s signature. Because of a misinterpreted label on a printed copy of the painting, it was thought for some time to be the artist’s grandmother, but about 25 years ago the sitter was identified as Aechje Claesdr. She was the widow of the Rotterdam brewer Jan Pesser (who died in 1619) and one of the leading figures among Rotterdam’s Remonstrant community.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Remonstrants were Protestants, but their beliefs were slightly different from the Calvinist orthodoxy that dominated religion in Holland at the time. In 1619, they were banned from practising and many of their preachers were persecuted. Two of Aechje’s sons-in-law were Remonstrant preachers and she had to hide one of them in her house, but she managed to escape persecution herself. In 1634 Rembrandt came to Rotterdam to paint not only Aechje’s portrait but also those of her son Dirck and his wife Haesje van Cleyburgh. It may be that the famous preacher Johannes Wtenbogaert, whose portrait Rembrandt had painted in 1633 and who was living in Rotterdam at that time, introduced him to the family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Aechje’s costume is not a fashionable one for 1634 – she is dressed in a style which was in vogue during her youth. Over a plain bodice she is wearing a sleeveless coat, or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">graingat</span>, with large shoulder wings. Her pleated ruff is of moderate size, and she has tied an apron over her coat. Despite her wealth, her clothes are relatively modest – the only hint of luxury are the three tiny gold pins which hold her two-piece headdress in place.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Something doesn’t quite add up about this mysterious portrait. The sitter – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> did not identify her – has an almost regal poise. She looks down on us from a slight height. Her right hand resting on what must be part of the arm of a chair, but which has the lustre of gold and the air of a sceptre. She wears expensive pearl earrings and a gold chain, and the jewels threaded into the scarf or ribbons in her hair shimmer in the light which seems to come from a window high to her right. The mantle around her shoulders has been sketched only roughly and is hard to interpret, but the way it lies in heavy folds suggests it may be a luxurious white fur.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">All these might hint at the trappings of royalty, yet this is also an intimate, even erotically charged, portrait. She is wearing a dress of lilac-coloured silk, which seems to be unfastened at the front; beneath that, a loose undershirt, perhaps also partly undone. She reaches inside the mantle and it falls slightly open, revealing much more of her breast than would have been acceptable in a formal portrait of the time. X-ray images show that Rembrandt changed the arrangement of the hands to create this effect: they were originally clasped much more modestly in her lap.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Since this is far too risqué to be a formally commissioned portrait of a client, who is this young woman whom Rembrandt wanted to depict with such intimacy? It would help if we could be sure when it was painted. There is a date in the bottom left corner, by the signature, which seems to read either 1639 or 1659. But both this and the signature may have been added later, by someone else. Certainly the earlier date, when Rembrandt’s wife <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saskia</a> was still alive, seems unlikely. Rembrandt’s love life provides some clues, however.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After Saskia died in 1642, Rembrandt never remarried, almost certainly because he would have lost much-needed income from the dowry she left in her will. But he had affairs with the two women employed to look after their young son, Titus. Rembrandt fell out badly with the first, Geertje Dircx, when the 23-year old Hendrickje Stoffels joined the household in 1649. He and Hendrickje became lovers and, in 1654, had a daughter, Cornelia. Despite condemnation from the church council on account of her pregnancy outside marriage – she was ’severely punished, admonished to repentance, and excluded from the Lord’s Supper [communion]' – she continued to live with her lover until her early death, probably from the plague of 1663.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While he and Hendrickje were together in the 1650s Rembrandt made and dated several informal paintings of what appears to be the same young woman – someone who looks remarkably similar to the person in this portrait. None of the canvases is documented with a name, but most art historians accept that they must represent Hendrickje. A date of 1659, as inscribed here, is therefore possible, but she would have been about 35 and she seems younger here, so a date of 1654–6 has been suggested. <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D7O-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman bathing in a Stream</a></span> may also be of Hendrickje.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This wise-looking old man is Jacob Trip. He was one of the biggest arms dealers during one of the most turbulent periods of conflict in European history. However, Rembrandt has given him the air not of a warmonger, but of a priest or religious figure – a bringer, perhaps, of peace and thus of prosperity. By 1660, Amsterdam was one of the richest cities in Europe, its citizens profiting from a network of worldwide trade – but that network had to be protected aggressively by a powerful navy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As Amsterdam flourished, it expanded rapidly, with smart merchants’ houses rising along the canals which ringed the city. In 1660, work started on the largest and most distinctive of these new buildings – the Trippenhuis, a palatial residence built for Jacob Trip’s two sons. It survives to this day, and that the Trips were proud of their trade is clear: the chimneys are shaped like cannons, while palm fronds, representing peace, are carved on the facade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacob, now about 85, had built the fortune which made his family one of the wealthiest in the Netherlands. His portrait was almost certainly commissioned – along with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FL7-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait of his wife Margaretha</a> – to hang in the Trippenhuis. The sheer size of the canvases tells us that they were intended to be shown in an impressively large room – and both were once larger still, but have been trimmed by a few centimetres around their edges. Now in his mid-fifties, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> was perhaps no longer the most fashionable portrait painter, but it is testimony to his fame that the Trip family nevertheless turned to him to paint the portraits of this powerful couple.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Trip is dressed informally. These are indoor clothes: a shawl instead of a collar, a loose robe, a nightcap. They also hint at his wealth – the robe is probably padded silk of a type imported from Japan. But the style is also reminiscent of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tabbaard</span>, a robe traditionally worn by scholars and clerics. It is this, combined with Trip’s upright poise and his staff, that gives him the air of a priest or a figure from the Old Testament. Some have argued that the stick, which Rembrandt has been careful to emphasise with white highlights, is indicative of Trip’s frailty. But this one – with no handle to lean on – would have made a poor support, and Trip holds it lightly between his thumb and forefingers. We could see it as an instrument of power – a sceptre rather than a prop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Either way, it is clear that Trip is to be venerated as rich, wise and powerful. The question is why Rembrandt painted husband and wife in two distinct styles. The portrait of Jacob has been executed at some speed and with unusual economy. Rembrandt, usually meticulous in his application of paint when depicting flesh tones, has been very sparing here, especially around the eyes, the shadowed side of Trip’s face and on his hands. Compare this to the much more intensely layered paintwork of Margaretha’s skin. Trip’s scarf is rendered with just a few long, white brushstrokes and much of the lower part of his robe is scarcely painted at all, with only a few suggestive touches applied on top of the background colour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There have been several attempts to explain these differences. We know that Trip died in 1661, around the same time the portrait was commissioned. Perhaps Rembrandt was working unusually fast to capture the likeness of a man who was mortally ill. Perhaps he started painting only after Trip’s death and had to rely on other portraits. Or perhaps he was deliberately contrasting the fading presence of a dying man with the vibrant energy of his wife, who still had another ten years to live.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Margaretha de Geer was the wife of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob Trip</a> and their two portraits were made to hang together, almost certainly in one of the grand reception rooms of a palatial new residence, the Trippenhuis, which was being built in Amsterdam for their two sons from 1660 to 1662.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacob and Margaretha’s marriage seems to have been of economic advantage to both their families. Trip was a young Dordrecht merchant, and his brother was in business with Margaretha’s arms- and iron-dealing brother. They were together nearly 60 years and had 12 children, at least five of whom were still alive when these paintings were made.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It would have been conventional to portray the couple in symmetrical, mirrored poses – each turned slightly towards the other. But here <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> is inventive. Jacob, who was close to death or may even have recently died when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJL-0001-0000-0000.htm">his portrait</a> was made, sits askew, his face and hands half in shadow. He doesn’t meet our gaze but instead stares down and out of the picture with, perhaps, a slight air of melancholy. Margaretha, however, is presented face-on and looks directly at us with determination. She seems to perch upright and intent, somewhat uneasily even, slightly to one side of the chair. Rembrandt had to work on this pose before he got it right: X-ray images show that her left hand at first rested in her lap, but was then repositioned, gripping the arm of the chair. This not only makes her seem more active – about to rise towards us – but pushes the hand forwards, into our space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">And what a hand. Rembrandt had many extraordinary skills, but in his ability to depict flesh, and most especially ageing skin, he has no equal. He used the semi-transparent qualities of oil paint to build up layers, textures, colours – the blue veins and dry yellowy sheen of an old woman’s fingers and the back of her hands. On her brightly lit face, the pinks and greys, and the furrows of her brow, are worked with similar intensity, and this marks another contrast in Rembrandt’s approach to the two portraits. He used quicker, much more sparing brushwork to paint Jacob’s shadowy features.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is difference too in their clothing. While Jacob’s is suggested with minimal efficiency – look at the long, simple brushstrokes used to suggest his scarf – Margaretha’s splendid collar, a millstone ruff, is depicted with extreme delicacy. It is the centrepiece of the portrait. The starched precision of the pleats fills the painting with light which glows around her face. The ruff, highly fashionable in the 1620s, is, by now, 40 years out of date, but its crisp resilience seems to reflect her own inner vitality. Margaretha was 79 years old, and had another ten years to live; her husband was dying, or had already died. The white handkerchief in her right hand may simply be fashion accessory, or it may a sign of mourning added by Rembrandt after Jacob’s death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery also has another <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB8-0001-0000-0000.htm">smaller portrait of Margaretha</a> at about the same age and dressed in similar clothes, although its attribution to Rembrandt is not entirely secure.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made in 1635, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> was 29 years old, just over three years after he had set up his studio in Amsterdam. He had already become one the most famous and successful portrait painters in the city, and the man depicted here, Philip or Philips Lucasz. of Middelburg, was typical of his clients. Lucasz. was wealthy, successful and with some status in Amsterdam society. Then in his thirties, he was an important official in the Dutch East India Company, which was the source of most of Holland’s trading success during the seventeenth century. He had been in charge of the company’s fleet, which had sailed for Holland from the East Indies in December 1633 and was to leave Holland again on 2 May 1635, presumably only shortly after this picture was finished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In August 1634, Lucasz. had married Petronella Buys of The Hague, who was born about 1605. Her portrait (now in a private collection) was also painted by Rembandt and the two were most likely designed to be hung side by side. The first recorded owner of the two pictures, Jacques Specx, was Petronella’s brother-in-law through his marriage to her sister and an important patron of Rembrandt in the 1630s. He and his wife may have commissioned them for themselves, or they may perhaps have been given them by the sitters.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The black tunic and white lace collar Lucasz. wears were conventional at the time, but the gold chain around his neck was not a common item of  men’s dress. However, such chains were often given as a reward for service by the directors of the East India Company to commanders who – like Lucasz. – had brought their merchant fleets home successfully.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the portrait is signed by Rembrandt himself (on the lower right-hand side), there is a clumsiness about the painting which, it has been argued, suggests that one or more of his assistants may have had a hand in it. The thick black line representing the shadow between the sitter’s lips has been made in quite a rudimentary way, for example, and the painting of the lace collar is also unusual. Instead of the details of the white lace being painted over the black fabric beneath, which would be the normal and logical way of creating the effect, the artist has taken the reverse approach: the collar has been painted as a solid block of white paint and the detail of the lace shapes has been outlined in black. In some places, this was done even before the white paint had dried properly. The same method was used to depict the gold chain in the places where it shows through the lace collar – the yellow paint has been applied on top of the white, instead of the other way round. But it is possible that Rembrandt was forced to deliver the painting to a tight deadline, and that what we see here are simply signs of overhasty work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter’s left hand, which X-ray images show was depicted touching the gold chain, has been painted out, perhaps as early as the late seventeenth century. The picture’s elaborate frame was probably made in Holland in the 1690s.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saskia van Uylenburgh, the daughter of a burgomaster of Leeuwarden in Friesland, was Rembrandt’s first wife. Here, she is 23 years old; they have been married for a year.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saskia van Uylenburgh, the daughter of a burgomaster of Leeuwarden in Friesland, was 23 years old and had been married to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> for a year when he painted her portrait. She is in Arcadian costume (in other words, dressed as a shepherdess, though a very grand little shepherdess).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She has gold embroidery on her wide belt and on the brocade edge to her spring-green over-gown. Her sumptuous dress bells out over her cream satin petticoats and the light, almost transparent sleeves fall at her sides in gauzy folds. The low wide neck pushes up her breasts, edging them with delicate lace. Her long red hair waves down to brush her shoulders, and glowing pearls hang from her ears and peep over the crown of her head. The necklace of tiny wild flowers is echoed around her brow and a sprig of juniper sways over her head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her costume is not of the seventeenth century, nor of Roman times: it’s a dressing-up version of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> dress, something that Rembrandt liked to use for intimate portraits and the big biblical scenes he aspired to paint, regardless of when they were actually thought to have taken place. They added drama or poetic meaning to the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is sometimes referred to as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saskia as Flora</span>’, the Roman goddess of spring and fertility, a title much more in keeping with her costume and with the profusion of flowers that she holds, primulas, tulips, roses and tiny pinks among them. In the other hand is her shepherdess’s stick, entwined with delicate green leaves. At the time, such classical representations – the Seasons, Greek or Roman gods and goddesses or more abstract figures such as Justice, Mercy, Envy – were popular in all the arts. Poets, writers and composers all looked back at the ancient world for inspiration.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But it’s possible that there’s another dimension to this portrait. Saskia grasps the stick firmly as if for support, rather than just as a decorative prop. The hand clutching the flowers is stiff and tense from the weight and unwieldiness of the bouquet. She appears to lean back slightly, as if easing discomfort, carrying unaccustomed weight. Suspended across her gown just below the waist, a little chain draws attention to her belly. Her expression is difficult to decipher. Her large blue eyes gaze not at us, but a little over to the right to someone standing near – the artist perhaps. Her oval face with soft cheeks is enlivened by a little half-smile. We can‘t discount the possibility that when Saskia stood as the model for this painting she was visibly pregnant, and that Rembrandt has portrayed her as such.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the seven years of their marriage, Saskia had three children who died very young. Only the fourth child, Titus, survived into adulthood. Titus was born in 1641. Saskia died a year later and Titus in 1668, a year before his father. So for Rembrandt, although the promise of abundant life was fulfilled for a while, it didn’t endure – except in his portrait of Saskia as Flora, goddess of spring.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">You are looking into the eyes of a man in the last year of his life. Rembrandt is 63 and this is one of three self portraits he painted in the months before his death in 1669. About 80 self portraits – including sketches, etchings and paintings – survive from his 40-year career, far more than any other painter of his time. Why did Rembrandt paint himself so often? And what was he thinking as he looked in the mirror?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some self portraits, especially the earlier ones, were made to practise depicting different expressions and poses, or to experiment with lighting effects. Others – such as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">one he painted aged 34</a> – were apparently intended to enhance his image as an artist. Sometimes he may have had an eye to the market, or even worked to a commission. At the time some wealthy patrons collected self portraits by artists. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Charles I</a> owned several, including one by Rembrandt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here his intentions are not so clear. X-ray images show that Rembrandt did, at first, depict himself as an artist at work – hands open, holding what seems to be a brush. But he changed his mind, apparently to avoid distracting the viewer from the detail of his face. Indeed, it seems as though he has turned a spotlight on his features. The beam bounces off his high forehead and the tip of his nose; it catches on his mottled, pitted brow and the tufts of hair around his lips. By contrast, the dark, shadowy background is thinly painted, the texture of his robe and fur collar sketchy and his folded hands are blurred and indistinct.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It wasn’t only light effects that he used to emphasise his face. The paint here is different. It’s much thicker and more intensively applied; so much so that he appears to be modelling the skin in three dimensions. The sagging fold beneath his right eye is made with the swirl of a heavily-loaded brush. The blemishes on his forehead are formed of blotches of coagulated paint. He uses layers too: like skin, oil paint is semi-transparent, so Rembrandt builds up translucent layers and colours – the greys and whites, pinks, purples and pasty yellows which he sees in his own face.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The effect seems to be one of intense self-scrutiny, and many later writers and artists have regarded this, together with his other late self portraits, as part of a process of self examination – Rembrandt coming to terms with the approach of death, searching with unflinching honesty to know himself. In this portrait some see weariness and resignation in his dark, rheumy eyes, some a trace of self satisfaction, others the hint of a wry, knowing smile.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But, if we want to understand why Rembrandt made the painting we need to be careful. In the seventeenth century people had different ideas about self-analysis and how the mind works than we do now. And Rembrandt’s motives may have been rather more straightforward, driven less by soul-searching and more by a professional fascination with the textures, flaws and subtleties of the human flesh.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When he painted himself, he could study his reflection for as long as he liked – and with an intensity which might have been disconcerting for some of his clients, many of whom were the same age as him. So it seems as though Rembrandt was not only studying how time was ageing his own skin, he was perfecting how he might depict theirs. That mysterious look in his eye may not be one of existential angst, but that of a painter deeply engaged in the challenges of his art.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ'</a>s body has just been taken down from the Cross, and his family and followers mourn over him – a moment known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Lamentation</a>. The central group here are defined by their expressions of intense grief. A variety of onlookers surround them, and the scene extends into a receding cityscape that gives this small picture a grandiose air.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt has cleverly used the lighter end of his tonal range so that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and Christ’s body are illuminated, standing out in this dark picture. Mary has fainted, and almost looks like an extension of her son; a woman dressed in a white headscarf holds her limp right hand. The older man supporting her reclining body has been identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nicodemus</a>. Meanwhile, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> passionately embraces Christ’s feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work is accepted as an autograph grisaille (a picture painted in shades of black, white and grey) by Rembrandt. The top and bottom bits, however, are later additions by a different hand, although probably made under Rembrandt’s supervision. The picture has a very complex makeup. Rembrandt himself began by making an oil sketch on paper; he then tore out a section and mounted the rest on canvas. He continued the design on the canvas at the lower right. Finally, someone added canvas strips at the top and bottom, completing what we see today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is likely a study for an etching that was never executed, and there is some iconographical evidence to support this claim. Christ was crucified alongside two men, the so-called Good Thief and Bad Thief. In this picture, the Bad Thief – identifiable by his twisted body hanging in darkness – would have been on Christ’s right-hand side, which was traditionally reserved for the Good Thief. However, when making an etching the whole composition is reversed in the printmaking process; the positions of the two thieves would have therefore been reversed. Rembrandt’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FT3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ecce Homo</a></span>, another grisaille in the National Gallery’s collection, was made as a preparatory study for an etching that we know still exists in two different states.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rembrandt made a drawing of the same subject while he was working on this grisaille, which is now in the British Museum, London – it is a study related to the lower part of the picture. Similarly to the painting, Rembrandt made many alterations and additions to his drawing. The laborious processes of these <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentations</span> must have meant that Rembrandt was invested in the subject.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A woman kneels and weeps. Darkness like a great cavern surrounds her. A shaft of light picks her out on the stone steps. Behind her, huge gold columns and a tall gilded altar loom out of the shadows cast by glimmering candles. They tower up into the gloom, dwarfing the people gathered below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Blurred figures of worshippers by the altar follow an ancient ritual, but the woman is alone in a crowd of men – old men in black with beards, and one in red velvet with a huge, glittering turban. A gnarled hand, caught in the light, indicates her. An armed soldier grasps the fragile veil that almost slips from her bowed head. Her long hair tumbles over her shoulder onto her white shift, an undergarment – her shame is made visible, with not even a simple robe to cover her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The men’s eyes are on a single figure. His brown robe, his red beard and long hair have become an image widely recognisable: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. Calm and unmoving, he looks down at the woman. He waits, as does one of his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> with a shorn head, hand grasping his robe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a moment from the story of the woman taken in adultery, as told in the Gospel of John. The Sadducees and Pharisees – members of the Jewish ruling council – were afraid and jealous of Christ’s preaching and growing influence in the community, and planned to trick him into transgressing the Jewish law. They said to him: ‘Teacher, this woman has been caught in the act of adultery. Now in the law Moses commanded us to stone such women. What do you say about her?’ (John 8: 3–7)</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The tension in the group of men, Christ’s thoughtful air and the woman’s continuing tears suggest that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> has depicted the moment of decision that could entrap the dangerous young preacher. A man in black puts a finger to his lips, as if hushing the crowd. Will Christ plead for mercy or will he uphold the law? It seems that either way, he is condemned as well as the woman.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His reply became one of the most famous quotations in the history of Christianity. ‘He that is without sin among you, let him first cast a stone at her.’ The woman was released, the accusers confounded. Christ was free to preach again – but not without a parting word to the repentant woman: ‘Go and sin no more.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In seventeenth-century Holland, the Church had rejected the Catholic practice of decorating churches with  holy images and statues of saints, which for centuries had served to illuminate Bible texts for ordinary worshippers. The walls in Protestant churches were whitewashed and unadorned, but there was still a market for pictures that told stories from the Bible. The pictures told a moral tale, but the drama in them also entertained and provided a talking point. They were also a symbol of wealth but not least were they appreciated and treasured for their artistic merit. The young Rembrandt was acclaimed for his striking ability to portray drama in a way that struck to the heart.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of Rembrandt’s most powerful paintings – especially those made later in his life – are of men and women immersed in thought, depicted with bold brushwork and dramatic, shadowy light effects. Slumped sideways across a chair, one hand gripping the wooden arm and the other resting lightly on his temple, this elderly man is in just such a mood. His eyes are cast down towards the floor, and the light which slants across his body from behind his left shoulder throws them into a deep shade. This is not a portrait of an individual but a study of a ‘character type’, a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre</a> of painting that lends itself to experimentation far more than would a formal portrait. And this picture does seem to be highly experimental.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> has captured the gleam on the man’s fingernail and the dry skin of his wrist with simple dabs and flecks of white paint. Bright white and yellow pigments evoke the shimmer on the fur collar and on the patch of yellow silk or satin next to it. These highlights, together with the man’s balding head, the fuzz of greying hair, the upper part of his face and the wooden upright of the chair immediately behind are the only parts of the painting which have been articulated with precision. Although they have been evoked economically in places, with relatively few brushstrokes, they remain convincing even when we look quite closely at the painting. The rest of the picture is much more roughly sketched in. The highlights on the left sleeve, for example, are depicted with only half a dozen very broad brushstrokes. We have to stand well back from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> for the illusion to work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This highly suggestive, sometimes quite rough, style of painting was very innovative for the time, and it was an approach which became more typical of Rembrandt’s work as he grew older. However, some studies have argued that inconsistencies – and some perceived clumsiness – in the painting style do not amount to experimentation. And they point to some unusual use of pigments that raise questions over the painting’s authorship, suggesting that, even though Rembrandt has apparently signed and dated (1652) the picture himself in the top left-hand corner, it may be at least partly by a contemporary pupil or follower. In seventeenth-century Holland, a signature did not necessarily guarantee authorship in the way we think of it today. Rembrandt employed several apprentices who were encouraged to copy his paintings and to create their own independent compositions inspired by motifs or themes borrowed from his original works. While still apprentices, pupils were not allowed to sign their works; some of their better efforts may have been signed by their master before leaving the studio.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is hard to believe that a painter would have taken such a bold and innovative approach when attempting to imitate the style of his master, and it has recently been convincingly proposed that this work does indeed represent an important early and experimental step in Rembrandt’s development towards the rough manner of his later works.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Margaretha de Geer was married to Jacob Trip – an extremely wealthy merchant and arms dealer – for nearly 60 years. Rembrandt painted large-scale likenesses of each, which were originally designed to hang together. Both are now in the National Gallery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This smaller portrait of Margaretha was painted at about the same time, in 1661. It is dated and signed ‘Rembrandt’, but technical analysis and some differences between the way that this and the larger portrait were painted have raised questions about authorship. Although it is a convincing likeness painted with great skill, the signature is not authentic, and this has led some to think this may be a contemporary or slightly later version of Rembrandt’s original. But the painting is of such high quality that this is not a satisfying solution to the problem either.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an excellent example of how tricky it is to be sure who painted a picture made more than 350 years ago. Until recently, people thought this portrait must be by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>. After all, on the left, a little below shoulder height, you can just make out the signature in his usual style, along with the date, 1661.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another strong clue is that this is clearly Margaretha de Geer, the wife of the extremely wealthy arms dealer <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob Trip</a> – Rembrandt painted portraits of each of them in or around 1661. They are very large canvases and hang together in the National Gallery today. This painting is a smaller version of the portrait of Margaretha – the face is very similar, as are the clothes she is wearing. Surely, we might think, she liked the way Rembrandt depicted her first time around, and immediately commissioned him to make another portrait, either for herself or perhaps for one of her children or grandchildren. Lastly, the quality of painting is extremely high – this is a convincing likeness, rendered with great skill and worthy of an artist of Rembrandt’s stature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, in the late 1980s, technical analysis revealed unexpected differences between this and other paintings produced by Rembrandt. In particular, the materials used for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> are unusual, though not unknown, for the seventeenth century, and certainly different from the kind Rembrandt usually used. The way that the canvas was mounted on the frame also differs from his normal practice. Neither of these inconsistencies are hard proof that Rembrandt or his workshop did not prepare the canvas. But, because they are unusual, they have also focused attention on some differences in style between the two portraits of Margaretha.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this version, the paint has been applied with more fluidity and speed. Look, for example, how the brush has made swirls around her mouth and the sides of her nose, compared with the more precisely applied colour in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FL7-0001-0000-0000.htm">the other portrait</a>. And while Rembrandt has worked on the face of the larger portrait with enormous care, there are several places where the artist of this version has left the ground unpainted – the areas around her left temple and above her left eye are good examples. The folds and highlighted outlines of Margaretha’s ruff are also rendered slightly differently in each painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Again, such variations in technique do not prove that Rembrandt had no part in the painting. Maybe he was forced to work much faster on this portrait than on the other. Perhaps, having just done one, he felt more confident of capturing a likeness, so simply worked more swiftly. Perhaps he was simply experimenting with different techniques – he had used a more rapid, fluid technique in, for example, his portrait of Margaretha’s husband.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As for the signature, unfortunately we can’t rely on that either. Rembrandt’s name was often forged on unsigned paintings which have survived from when he was alive, and also on some made long after his death. However, in this case, the date is consistent with the other portrait, and it is unlikely that it would have been added without a signature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We will probably never know for sure. But because the two paintings normally hang near each other in the same gallery, they provide a good opportunity to try to divine, and get closer to understanding, the hand of Rembrandt.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This atmospheric painting shows a lonely figure seated in front of a huge volume open on the table before him. He has closed one of the window shutters, but brilliant sunlight floods through the others and onto the wall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Much of the image’s power lies not just in the dramatic tension between light and dark, but in the way the artist has used thick white paint and grey detailing to capture the refraction and reflection of light by the glass. This contrasts subtly with the clear light which pours in through the open window below the glazed ones. In the deep shadows beyond these highlights we can make out shelves of books and two globes mounted on the wall above them. This is a library and so the man at the table must be a scholar searching in the gloom for enlightenment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But while it is highly evocative, this painting has also proved controversial. When bought by the National Gallery in 1917 it was described as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Philosopher</span>, by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>’ and was believed to be an important early work dating to about 1628–9. Now it has a different, much more neutral, title and is no longer thought to be by him. Why the change?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The question of attribution to a single artist is always somewhat problematic. Many paintings signed by a single artist who, like Rembrandt, ran a busy workshop, would have been made with at least some help from assistants (though in this case the painting’s small size makes that less likely). Over the last few decades many paintings once attributed to Rembrandt have come under scrutiny and been reattributed as predominantly the work of his studio assistants, or as works by contemporary followers or later forgers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Close examination of this painting has thrown up some inconsistencies which, though not enough to disprove Rembrandt’s authorship altogether, have cast significant doubt on it. Most of this evidence is based on very detailed examination of the brushstrokes, the unusual way that lines have been incised in the paint (look at the outlines around the hinges of the open shutter in the window jambs) and the rather rough way the figure has been depicted. The method used to join the boards on which the work is painted is one which has not been documented before in a Rembrandt work. True, there is an extremely faint ‘Rembrandt’ signature in the right foreground of this painting, but this is generally accepted as a later, fraudulent addition, and since Rembrandt didn’t always sign his paintings, it doesn’t prove anything either way.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Whoever the artist in this case, the style and subject matter is consistent with Rembrandt’s early work of 1625–31, before he moved to Amsterdam from his home town of Leiden. The image of a melancholic scholar, philosopher or scientist lost in thought was a popular one at the time, but it was not a subject which Rembrandt painted after 1631. Scientific dating of the wooden panels suggests that they are consistent with this period and analysis of some of the paint suggests that it was made and used in a similar way to Rembrandt’s usual practice. So it seems highly likely that this painting was made by an artist who had at least some familiarity with his workshop, subject matter and techniques.</p></div>
