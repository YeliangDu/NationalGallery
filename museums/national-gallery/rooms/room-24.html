          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">How do you paint music? It was a challenge which fascinated many Dutch artists in the early sixteenth century, when pictures of musicians and musical parties were very popular. Here ter Brugghen focuses on a lute player lost in his art, drawing us close to his subject by using strong, dramatic lighting to highlight the folds under his eyes, the long shadows of his fingers and his shiny red nose – so red that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P2F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hendrick ter Brugghen</a> may have been exaggerating for comic effect. Perhaps he was suggesting that the player had a few glasses of wine before launching into song. All this makes him seem more real, as though he is singing directly to us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such pictures of single musicians painted half-length were particularly popular among a group of painters based in Utrecht. They were know as the ‘Dutch Caravaggists’ because several, including ter Brugghen, had lived and studied in Rome and been heavily influenced by the distinctive style of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a> and his followers. They imitated his dramatic lighting effects and his preference for painting his subjects close up – and copied his subject matter too.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Genre paintings</a> of solo instrumentalists were not new – there are examples from the early sixteenth century – but Caravaggio’s two (or possibly three: the authorship of one version is disputed) paintings of a lute player of around 1596/7 seems to have reignited interest in the subject. Caravaggio included flowers, a violin and, in one version, a recorder in his compositions, perhaps to suggest an intellectual link between music, love and the transience of life. His Dutch imitators preferred to strip out extraneous detail, focusing entirely on the relationship between musician and instrument. A clue as to how the painting may have been understood at the time has been found in an engraving, made in 1624, of another painting of a singing lute player by ter Brugghen.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">How do you paint music? It was a challenge which fascinated many Dutch artists in the early sixteenth century, when pictures of musicians and musical parties were very popular. Here ter Brugghen focuses on a lute player lost in his art, drawing us close to his subject by using strong, dramatic lighting to highlight the folds under his eyes, the long shadows of his fingers and his shiny red nose – so red that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P2F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hendrick ter Brugghen</a> may have been exaggerating for comic effect. Perhaps he was suggesting that the player had a few glasses of wine before launching into song. All this makes him seem more real, as though he is singing directly to us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such pictures of single musicians painted half-length were particularly popular among a group of painters based in Utrecht. They were know as the ‘Dutch Caravaggists’ because several, including ter Brugghen, had lived and studied in Rome and been heavily influenced by the distinctive style of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a> and his followers. They imitated his dramatic lighting effects and his preference for painting his subjects close up – and copied his subject matter too.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Genre paintings</a> of solo instrumentalists were not new – there are examples from the early sixteenth century – but Caravaggio’s two (or possibly three: the authorship of one version is disputed) paintings of a lute player of around 1596/7 seems to have reignited interest in the subject. Caravaggio included flowers, a violin and, in one version, a recorder in his compositions, perhaps to suggest an intellectual link between music, love and the transience of life. His Dutch imitators preferred to strip out extraneous detail, focusing entirely on the relationship between musician and instrument. A clue as to how the painting may have been understood at the time has been found in an engraving, made in 1624, of another painting of a singing lute player by ter Brugghen. Underneath was printed: ‘I play expertly on the sweet full strings of the lute / Thereby I can also sing lustily and know that it sounds good.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ter Bruggen and his fellow Utrecht painters – such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q04-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Honthorst</a>, who had been in Rome at the same time – made many such paintings.

The tension is palpable: clearly we are being presented with a key moment in a story, but since the picture has no surviving title we have to make an educated guess as to what it is.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely to be a biblical scene, since these were the most popular type of narrative painting in Utrecht in the 1620s, and it probably comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3K-0008-0000-0000.htm">Old Testament</a> since <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> does not appear.

When Jacob discovered the deceit the morning after the marriage, he was bitterly disappointed, as ‘Rachel was beautiful and well favoured’ (Genesis 29: 17). He reproached his new father-in-law, but Laban argued that the elder daughter must be married first. He compromised by offering to allow him to marry Rachel as well – in return for another seven years work. The determined Jacob agreed, and was eventually simultaneously married to both sisters and their handmaids, and had 12 children.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This story would explain the young man’s shepherd’s crook, and his apparent disagreement or discussion with an older man over a young woman. It could represent the initial moment when Jacob asks Laban for Rachel’s hand, in which case the woman in blue must be Rachel herself. But the dinner table suggests the remains of the wedding breakfast and so, combined with the young man’s pointed finger, we are more likely to be looking at Jacob’s admonishment of Laban the morning after the wedding.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central character of this painting is hidden in the shadows. Here, an austerely dressed man with long hair and a beard seems to draw the attention of the people gathered before him. He can be identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>, standing on what looks like an improvised pulpit and pointing with his right hand, index finger outstretched.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject is taken from the Gospels, which begin the New Testament and are an important source for the life and teaching of Saint John. The Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 3: 1–12) locates John’s preaching in the wilderness, but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PHP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cornelis van Haarlem</a> has painted a landscape that does not seem very wild. It also describes John as wearing clothes made of camel’s hair with a leather belt around his waist, which does resemble the clothing of the figure here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Matthew recounts how people flocked from Jerusalem, Judea and ‘all the region round about Jordan’ to hear John’s message and to be baptised by him. Cornelis took great care in painting a great variety of people. Many look like his Haarlem contemporaries, while some – the group of five men in exotic headdress on the left side of the painting – resemble <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pharisees</a> or Sadducees. In the left foreground, men and women picnic; in the middle foreground one man casually leans on a drum as he chats. A small dog walks by, seemingly picking up on John’s voice, while a group of soldiers on horseback appears on the right side of the picture. The crowd is divided between conversation and close attention to John’s announcement of the coming of Christ – the boy who has climbed a tree stump to have a better view is an example of the latter. In the far background, the grouped silhouettes of even more people are visible.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three distinct ’spotlights' illuminate the foreground of the large, horizontal landscape. Gradually, the greens of the lush  vegetation make way for a blue atmospheric hue in the mountainous background. Cornelis seems to have adopted the large-scale landscape with a biblical subject from his Haarlem contemporary, the Flemish painter and biographer Karel van Mander, who situated his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dance around the Golden Calf</span> in a similar setting (Frans Hals Museum, Haarlem). Netherlandish artists of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries often painted the subject of Saint John the Baptist preaching, and its popularity may reflect contemporary debates about open-air sermons by Calvinist preachers, taking the saint as an example.</p></div>

When his men failed to return, Cadmus set out after them and came face to face with the monster. After a fierce struggle he killed it, and was told by Athena to sow its teeth in the ground.

The dragon’s black wings are outlined against a thundery sky, but a glimmer of hope is offered by a distant view of Cadmus fighting it to its death.

Following the direct orders of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, Sebastian’s fellow soldiers tied him to a post and shot him with so many arrows that, according to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, his body looked like a porcupine. He miraculously survived, but was clubbed to death on the Emperor’s command.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of Sebastian’s incredibly violent death was favoured by painters throughout Europe across centuries. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q04-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit van Honthorst</a> has shown the saint on the brink of death in this arresting close-up depiction. Four arrows pierce his partially naked body, which hangs lifelessly from what looks like an oak tree. The one that has stabbed through his leg points outward, and emphasises the painter’s signature in the lower left corner. Blood drips from this arrow’s tip in a steady stream, seemingly into our space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sebastian’s tormented body takes centre stage in Honthorst’s painting. The beautiful torso echoes classical sculpture, like the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Belvedere Torso</span>, which had been admired by artists in Rome since the fifteenth century. At the same time, the saint’s physical suffering was intended to inspire devotion: viewers were prompted to imagine his intense pain and the strength of his faith.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cult of Saint Sebastian was especially strong in Rome, where he was venerated as the city’s third patron saint after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Peter</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paul</a>. His remains were buried in the catacombs, at a spot now occupied by the Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura, a church dedicated to him. In the years that Honthorst spent in Rome, a number of ecclesiastical building projects dedicated to Sebastian were being planned or completed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was likely finished around 1623, three years after Honthorst had left Rome for his native Utrecht. There were a number of outbreaks of the plague in the city between 1624 and 1626, following renewed hostilities between the Dutch Republic and Spain that lead to food shortages and severe malnutrition in large parts of the population. From the seventh century onward, Sebastian was the most important saint to invoke for protection against the deadly disease. The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span> recounts how, in that century, the Italian city of Pavia had been scourged by the plague until an altar dedicated to Sebastian had been erected and relics of the saint brought in.</p></div>

Following the direct orders of the Roman Emperor Diocletian, Sebastian’s fellow soldiers tied him to a post and shot him with so many arrows that, according to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, his body looked like a porcupine. He miraculously survived, but was clubbed to death on the Emperor’s command.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of Sebastian’s incredibly violent death was favoured by painters throughout Europe across centuries. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q04-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit van Honthorst</a> has shown the saint on the brink of death in this arresting close-up depiction. Four arrows pierce his partially naked body, which hangs lifelessly from what looks like an oak tree. The one that has stabbed through his leg points outward, and emphasises the painter’s signature in the lower left corner. Blood drips from this arrow’s tip in a steady stream, seemingly into our space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sebastian’s tormented body takes centre stage in Honthorst’s painting. The beautiful torso echoes classical sculpture, like the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Belvedere Torso</span>, which had been admired by artists in Rome since the fifteenth century. At the same time, the saint’s physical suffering was intended to inspire devotion: viewers were prompted to imagine his intense pain and the strength of his faith.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cult of Saint Sebastian was especially strong in Rome, where he was venerated as the city’s third patron saint after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Peter</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paul</a>. His remains were buried in the catacombs, at a spot now occupied by the Basilica of San Sebastiano fuori le Mura, a church dedicated to him. In the years that Honthorst spent in Rome, a number of ecclesiastical building projects dedicated to Sebastian were being planned or completed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was likely finished around 1623, three years after Honthorst had left Rome for his native Utrecht. There were a number of outbreaks of the plague in the city between 1624 and 1626, following renewed hostilities between the Dutch Republic and Spain that lead to food shortages and severe malnutrition in large parts of the population. From the seventh century onward, Sebastian was the most important saint to invoke for protection against the deadly disease. The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span> recounts how, in that century, the Italian city of Pavia had been scourged by the plague until an altar dedicated to Sebastian had been erected and relics of the saint brought in.</p></div>

The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> presents the baby, who has a bright halo of light around his tiny head, to the kneeling king, who takes the child’s small foot in his hand in order to kiss it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PYL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Spranger</a> has positioned the two other kings, both proudly bearing ornate gold vessels containing their gifts, around the mother and child. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, the shadowy figure in a lime green tunic, encloses the group from behind. The kings and Joseph all take elegant poses, their limbs curving and arching gracefully. The elderly, kneeling king may be Melchior, from Arabia. The Black king is probably intended to represent Balthasar, who was thought to be African; his jewelled turban-style hat with a feather is an approximation of North African dress. The king in yellow, dressed in the style of a Roman soldier, is probably Caspar, King of Tarsus, a Roman city. The citrus colours of their glamorous clothing – peach shot with bright orange and acidic yellow – stand out in the darkness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These dazzling hues contrast dramatically with the gloominess of the upper part of the scene where, on the left, is the stable in which Christ was born. Shepherds load hay into the partially open wooden structure; an ox has emerged and seems to be scrutinising the unusual visitors. This rugged vignette, which includes a shepherd playing bagpipes, reminds us of paintings by Spranger’s contemporaries from his Flemish homeland. The stable is enclosed by ruined classical architecture – a nod to the buildings Spranger would have seen in Rome and a common feature of images of the Adoration of the Kings, where they symbolise how Christ‘​s birth overturned paganism. ​The guiding star appears in the sky at the top left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The self-conscious glamour of the foreground figures is a feature of the style known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mannerism</a> (the term comes from the Italian word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">maniera</span>, meaning manner or style). Its elegance and flamboyance suited the tastes of its wealthy and sophisticated patrons and it became a popular style in court circles. The style first developed in Italy in the sixteenth century, where Spranger (who was born in Antwerp) had spent ten years. Shortly afterwards, his skills earned him the position of court painter to Rudolf II, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, taking him to Vienna and then Prague. He has proudly inscribed this picture with an elaborate signature that proclaims his background and credentials, adding after his name: ’born in Antwerp and painter to his Holy Majesty the Emperor'.

Rudolf may have presented the painting as a gift to thank him for his support. In 1763 the castle collapsed, but the painting survived. It was moved to the chapel of nearby Seehof Castle, where it has been suggested the top corners were cut down to create the present framing arch.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> have arrived to worship the newborn Christ and offer him gifts – according to the Gospel of Matthew (2: 1–12), they followed a star to find him. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> presents the baby, who has a bright halo of light around his tiny head, to the kneeling king, who takes the child’s small foot in his hand in order to kiss it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PYL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Spranger</a> has positioned the two other kings, both proudly bearing ornate gold vessels containing their gifts, around the mother and child. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, the shadowy figure in a lime green tunic, encloses the group from behind. The kings and Joseph all take elegant poses, their limbs curving and arching gracefully. The elderly, kneeling king may be Melchior, from Arabia. The Black king is probably intended to represent Balthasar, who was thought to be African; his jewelled turban-style hat with a feather is an approximation of North African dress. The king in yellow, dressed in the style of a Roman soldier, is probably Caspar, King of Tarsus, a Roman city. The citrus colours of their glamorous clothing – peach shot with bright orange and acidic yellow – stand out in the darkness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These dazzling hues contrast dramatically with the gloominess of the upper part of the scene where, on the left, is the stable in which Christ was born. Shepherds load hay into the partially open wooden structure; an ox has emerged and seems to be scrutinising the unusual visitors. This rugged vignette, which includes a shepherd playing bagpipes, reminds us of paintings by Spranger’s contemporaries from his Flemish homeland. The stable is enclosed by ruined classical architecture – a nod to the buildings Spranger would have seen in Rome and a common feature of images of the Adoration of the Kings, where they symbolise how Christ‘​s birth overturned paganism. ​The guiding star appears in the sky at the top left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The self-conscious glamour of the foreground figures is a feature of the style known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mannerism</a> (the term comes from the Italian word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">maniera</span>, meaning manner or style). Its elegance and flamboyance suited the tastes of its wealthy and sophisticated patrons and it became a popular style in court circles. The style first developed in Italy in the sixteenth century, where Spranger (who was born in Antwerp) had spent ten years. Shortly afterwards, his skills earned him the position of court painter to Rudolf II, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a>, taking him to Vienna and then Prague.
