He used a dark background and dramatic lighting to highlight the contrast between different shapes and surfaces, such as the translucence of ripe gooseberries and the musty sheen on the plum.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The high degree of precision gives the impression of a realistic scene – you might assume it has been painted from life. But this can’t have been the case, because the food depicted here would not have been available at the same time. Asparagus spears are cut in May; strawberries usually ripen from June; gooseberries are picked in early July and plums in August.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Compositions which belied seasonal availability in this way were common in Dutch still-life and flower paintings, however. There was a long tradition of artists working from studio drawings rather than painting direct from nature.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QHL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen Coorte</a> is one of those unusual artists whose work was forgotten after his death and then rediscovered centuries later. This is a typical example of the small, exquisitely executed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still-life paintings</a> in which he specialised, and which only started to be appreciated again in the early twentieth century. The National Gallery owns just this example and acquired it only recently, in 2015.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The formula Coorte followed most often – as here – was to depict fruit, nuts, vegetables or shells set on the edge of a stone shelf. He used a dark background and dramatic lighting to create strong highlights and deep shadows, an effect which emphasises the contrast between the smooth finish and sharp edges of the stone and the softer curves of his subject. He was highly skilled at rendering the textures of natural surfaces, like the translucence of ripe gooseberries, the tiny pocks in the skins of the strawberries and the musty sheen on the plum. The curled, bug-nibbled edges of the leaves are also depicted with painstaking delicacy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This high degree of precision gives the impression of a realistic scene – you might assume it has been painted from life. But this can’t have been the case, because the food depicted would not have been available at the same time. Asparagus spears are cut in May; strawberries (these are small wild ones) can ripen as early as May, but June is much more likely; gooseberries are picked from early July; and it’s very unlikely that you would have found a ripe plum in seventeenth-century Holland before August.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Compositions which belied seasonal availability in this way were common in Dutch still-life and flower paintings, however. There was a long tradition of artists working from studio drawings and oil studies, and they were adept at reusing the same references. Indeed Coorte painted what seems to be the same bunch of asparagus several times – there is a version in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, for example – and the bowl of strawberries appears in at least two other pictures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This particular combination is unique in Coorte’s work. There may be no significance in his choice other than the aesthetic appeal of the different textures, and the strong, clear red and green colour contrasts. But a neat sequence does emerge from his selection: asparagus spears shoot directly from the earth, strawberries grow a few centimetres above it, gooseberry bushes mature at about one metre high and plums hang highest of all. Perhaps in his highly controlled, pared down way, Coorte was hinting at the rich variety which emerged from the market gardens and orchards of the Netherlands from soil to tree between May and August each year.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a warm and dark room Courbet’s rich, ripe apples seem to glow as if in firelight. Among them is a single pomegranate, squeezed in at the base of the heap. The heavy earthenware bowl lined with pale blue slip seems almost too small for the weight of the fruit piled into it. On the brown oak table, two apples sit in front of a pewter coffee pot that glints in the light. Close by is a tall, straight glass of red wine. The painting quickens all the senses. It is as if Courbet is saying that this simple scene holds all that is needed for fulfilment and contentment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1871 Courbet was arrested for his part in the toppling of the Vendóme Column, erected in 1820 by Napoleon I to commemorate the Battle of Austerlitz, during the Paris Commune, the radical government that ruled Paris from March to the end of May that year. Always opposed to imperial rule, in 1870 Courbet had refused the Légion d’honneur and became a founding member of the Arts Commission of the Commune. When the Commune fell, Courbet was taken to Sainte Pélagie, a jail in Paris, because of his fierce, rebellious stance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Sainte Pélagie he was treated not as a political prisoner but as a commoner, and was denied painting materials. Although he was eventually given permission to paint, he was confined to his cell and forbidden to have models to pose for him. His sister Zoé brought him flowers and fruit, and he was able to explore still-life painting, a genre almost new to him. After an illness he was transferred to a clinic in Neuilly for the rest of his sentence, as a ward of the state.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Courbet was now painting prolifically. In the tradition of jailed artists of the past, and as a matter of pride that he had been imprisoned for his political beliefs, Courbet inscribed his paintings with the name of the prison. But while this picture is  inscribed ‘Sainte Pélagie’, it’s not clear whether he was in the jail or the clinic when he painted it. He was denied an exhibition, but collectors greeted his prison pictures with enthusiasm. Still-life pictures were increasingly appreciated at the time and he wrote that ‘my paintings are selling marvellously, and I am obliged to take advantage of it in order to make up for my disasters’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The apples aren’t perfect. The shapes are uneven and knobbly, and the skins thick. A sharp knife would be needed to pare them, but the juice would run sweet from the red ones and sharp or bitter from the green. Several carry the brown marks of bruising or the beginnings of decay. Courbet had studied the still-life paintings of seventeenth-century Dutch artists in which rotting fruit, dying flowers, short lived insects or the embers of a fire were symbols of the fleeting nature of life. While flawed, Courbet’s apples are things of beauty. Rather than a warning of death, they are his affirmation of life – each one singular, sweet-smelling and tactile.</p></div>

Look at the way the artist has depicted the subtle highlights on the weave of the Turkish carpet, the sheen and lustre on silver and glass, the moist flesh of the lemon and waxy texture of its peel. The detail is so fine and convincing that if you look closely at the gleam of light on the rim of the left-hand glass you can even make out the reflection of a window.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But this picture is full of energy as well as detail. Look at powerful curves of the buffalo horn which sweep down from the top of the picture, and how they are countered by the arched tail of the lobster poised below. The lobster’s bright red shell and its drooping antennae confirm that it has been cooked, but the set of that tail and the menacing glint in its eye seem to suggest otherwise, adding power and tension to the composition. There are moments of stillness and serenity too, captured by the sunbeams which glow in the decanter and glasses.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These objects were not only chosen to display the painter’s virtuosity, they also celebrate a sumptuous lifestyle. Lobster was a luxury dish and lemons were rare and expensive, as were the fine glass, oriental rug and silver tableware. There’s red and white wine, adding to a sense of indulgence and plenty – a sense also reflected in rich colours, offset by the dark background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is a combination which is typical of what was known at the time as a ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Pronkstilleven</span>’ or ‘ostentatious still life’. The artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Willem Kalf</a>, was its most famous and successful exponent. He had been born in Rotterdam but in 1653, at the age of 34, he settled in Amsterdam. This painting was probably made just after that, when he was establishing himself as the leading still-life painter in Holland.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work was probably commissioned by a member, or members, of the Saint Sebastian Archers’ Guild in Amsterdam. It formed part of the civic guard, which was intended to protect the city from attack but was also a sort of high-status gentlemen’s club. The connection with the guild is suggested by the intricate base of the silver mount which holds the drinking horn. It depicts the martyrdom of their patron, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a>: he’s tied to a tree, shot with arrows and guarded by his persecutors, two Roman soldiers. At the top of the mount a lion holds a shield bearing the arms of the city of Amsterdam. The theme of archery is also echoed in the support underneath the table, which has been carved into a figure of the Roman god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, famous for his arrows of love.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If it was a guild, rather than a personal, commission, it may well have hung in their headquarters, a shooting range on the Singel Canal in Amsterdam which was known as the Handboogdoelen. The building still exists.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Various foods and containers compete for space on a bare wooden shelf or table. A plate is piled high with walnuts, with chestnuts and oranges scattered alongside and a colossal melon behind. There are earthenware jugs, probably containing oil or wine, and a small barrel, possibly filled with olives. The round boxes were normally used for storing cheese, the rectangular ones for sweets such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">dulce de membrillo</span>, a thick quince jelly eaten in slices. Someone may have started to prepare the food: some of the walnuts have been opened, though they remain uneaten, and one jug has lost the twine that secures its paper cover.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Meléndez</a>’s close-up view makes these ordinary objects appear monumental. Their placement might seem arbitrary but the artist has arranged his composition carefully: our eye moves along the boxes' diagonals from the smaller items in the foreground to the larger ones at the back. The unevenly stacked boxes are sharply foreshortened, helping to create a sense of depth. Though the colour range is limited, the intense light emphasises the range of textures on display, from the dimpled peel of the oranges to the delicate woodgrain of the barrel and boxes. A similar selection of objects, though differently arranged, appears in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I5B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still Life with Lemons and Oranges</a></span>, suggesting that Meléndez may have owned them or kept them as stock in his studio.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Meléndez placed his signature prominently, with a date of 1772, on the end of one of the boxes closest to us. He painted it at a time when he was hopeful of becoming court painter, having recently worked on a large series of still-life paintings for the Prince of Asturias, the son of Charles III, King of Spain. He was, however, unsuccessful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This composition has been painted over another work: an X-ray image shows a bust-length portrait of Charles III underneath, which might also have been painted by Meléndez. Its composition is based on a portrait that Anton Raphael Mengs made for the King in around 1761 (Museo del Prado, Madrid). As the monarch’s official image, various copies of Mengs’s painting were made and distributed across the vast Spanish empire during the 1760s and 1770s. Meléndez’s decision to paint over the portrait may reflect his bitter disappointment at being rejected for the royal post of court painter. Or perhaps he was unable to present it to the King or to a member of his court, and subsequently cut the canvas down and reused it, creating a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still-life painting</a> instead – the genre for which he is best known today.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Loosely painted in vibrant colours against a plain brown background, Monet carefully placed a still life of fruit on a tabletop covered with a crisp white tablecloth. In his still lifes of the 1860’s, the artist, like many of his contemporaries, took inspiration from the 18th-century artist Jean-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779). Chardin was well-known for his modest still lifes of humble domestic objects set on a table or ledge. Monet would paint similar yet more dynamic compositions, carefully balancing the vibrant colours and dark shadows.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet possibly painted the work because still lifes were popular with Parisian dealers and collectors. The interest in Chardin had resurfaced in the early 1860’s and so had the enthusiasm for his genre. Whether a strategic choice or the outcome of a rainy day staying inside, Monet’s still lifes are a remarkable fusion of traditional genre and personal vision.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Loosely painted in vibrant colours against a plain brown background, a still life of fruit is set on a tabletop covered with a crisp white tablecloth. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> places two brightly coloured apples in the foreground, one red and the other red and green, shimmering with touches of white paint. In the wicker basket lined with vine leaves, four pears are meticulously stacked. A fifth stands to the left, partly behind three bunches of plump grapes. Monet carefully places a source of light to the left of the composition, as the shadows of both apples and pears fall sharply to the right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The work was painted in 1867 when Monet was 27 years old. Like his contemporaries <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Edouard Manet</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Cezanne</a>, in his early works Monet took inspiration from the 18th-century artist Jean-Siméon Chardin (1699-1779). Rediscovered in the 1860’s, Chardin was greatly admired for his modest still lifes consisting of humble domestic objects such as fruit, poultry, pots and kitchen utensils, placed on a table or ledge. Like Chardin, Monet would depict homely objects, but unlike that artist he would often depict his still lifes on top of white table linen. This simple cloth was possibly inspired by Manet’s still lifes of the 1860’s, in which he also included draped linen. Where Chardin’s still lifes are austerely arranged, Monet would intricately stage the fruits to create a dynamic composition. Here, the triangular pile of pears is placed strategically in the wicker basket, adding a diagonal line to the otherwise horizontal arrangement. In addition, the artist also carefully balances the variety of colours, contrasting the red and green apple with the yellow pears and multi-coloured grapes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But why would Monet choose to paint a still life at a time when he was also working on more complex group portraits and vibrant seascapes? It is possible that he did so because they were a genre popular with dealers and collectors. In the same year, his submissions to the influential Paris Salon were rejected. Possibly, to conform with the more conservative trajectory of the Salon jury and Parisian collectors, Monet chose a subject and style he knew would be appreciated. Another possibility is that the work was painted simply on a rainy day, when the artist couldn’t go outside. After all, for most of 1867, Monet was living in Saint-Adresse on the Normandy coast, where wet summers are no exception. Whether a strategic choice or the result of bad weather, Monet’s still lifes are a remarkable fusion of traditional genre and personal vision.</p></div>

These were exotic and highly desirable goods, and this painting is a celebration of luxury.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">Still life</a> compositions were one of the most popular genres of Dutch painting in the seventeenth century. A painter’s ability to create a picture with what we now think of as almost photographic realism was highly valued, and the objects depicted were selected partly to demonstrate artistic skill in showing different surfaces and textures. Here <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Jansz. Treck</a>, a native of Amsterdam, has risen to the challenge of evoking the lustre of and distorted reflections in silver, pewter, glass, porcelain and eggshells as well as the complex shadows in a crumpled linen cloth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But the choice of objects, how they were arranged and the tone or atmosphere of such paintings varied hugely. In some, a narrative or a moral might be implied and highlighted with dramatic lighting, such as in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D1C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still Life: An Allegory of the Vanities of Human Life</a></span> by Steenwyck. Objects depicted might be expensive or everyday, the colours rich or muted, the arrangement relatively orderly, or apparently teetering on the verge of disaster.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Looked at in this context, we can see that this rather beautiful example has a particularly calm aesthetic. Though the blues would once have been brighter (the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> used, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMS-0008-0000-0000.htm">smalt</a>, has faded over time) the overall colour scheme is muted, dominated by greys, greens and browns. Only the bright red berries stand out in this otherwise almost monochrome composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The selection of objects also contributes to this quietened atmosphere. Very often still-life paintings featured a diverse range of objects which had obviously been gathered together for the painting. And while the montage here clearly didn’t happen by chance, there’s a certain naturalism to it: we might believe that we have stumbled on the aftermath of a meal. Here is one end of a table where the plates, dishes and a flagon have been temporarily pushed to one side, together with a tall wine glass and a discarded napkin. There is only a little wine left in the glass, and someone seems to have had their fill of the berries. There aren’t many left, and only two small bird’s eggs remain in the smaller dish. A bread roll has also been left half eaten, crumbs scattered on the cloth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One feature does deliberately undercut the naturalism: the vine entwined around the flagon was a motif particular to Treck which he used in several paintings. And a viewer from seventeenth-century Amsterdam would have known that the two blue and white dishes were not normal domestic tableware, but very expensive late Ming-period Chinese porcelain. These were exotic and highly desirable goods, just as the silver spoon and knife were of a design which had come into fashion only recently. So we can see that this is more than just a depiction of the remains of a meal – it is a celebration of luxury typical of Dutch still lifes. Indeed, Treck had used most of the objects shown here in another painting which he made four years earlier (now in the Museum of Fine Arts, Budapest), but there the atmosphere is much more stressful, with one of these expensive dishes balanced precariously near the edge of the table.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this small and intimate painting – it only measures around 20 by 30 cm – everyday objects appear monumental and take on a mystical intensity. On a tabletop or ledge, a ceramic cup of water with delicately curved handles sits in the centre of a shiny metal plate, made of pewter or silver. A rose in full bloom balances on the plate’s edge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">That these objects have religious significance would have been immediately obvious to devout Spanish viewers in the seventeenth century. The cup full of water was seen as a symbol of purity of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, having been the one chosen by God to give birth to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. The rose is also often associated with Mary, and its thornlessness may refer to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> (the belief that she was conceived without sin). According to the third-century saint, Ambrose, the roses in the Garden of Eden only grew thorns after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam and Eve</a> had sinned. The rose – and lily, another flower associated with the Virgin – also appears as a symbol in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0NQ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still Life with Lemons in a Wicker Basket</a></span>, a work by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan de Zurbarán</a>, a gifted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still-life</a> painter and Francisco’s son. There, we also see a reference to the Virgin’s purity in the delicate porcelain cup containing water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, the cup, plate and rose are bathed in light, creating a marked contrast with the darkness behind. The stark simplicity of the surrounding space provides no distractions, and we are invited to appreciate the beauty of light reflecting on water and bouncing off polished surfaces. Different textures – the delicate rose petals, the cool smooth surface of the ceramic cup, and the reflections on the metal plate – are vividly conveyed. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francisco de Zurbarán’s</a> painting encourages meditation and quiet contemplation, an approach not dissimilar to that which he adopted in his religious paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was probably made in the early 1630s, shortly after Zurbarán had moved to Seville and established a workshop there. Very few still-life paintings by him are known, though he frequently included still-life elements in his religious works. This painting is closely related to Zurbarán’s most celebrated still life, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Still Life with Basket of Oranges</span> (Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena), which is dated 1633. It is a larger composition which incorporates the three objects on show here, though with a minor variation in the position of the rose and a slightly different viewpoint. These differences suggest our painting is not merely a replica after a detail in the Norton Simon painting, but that it was produced as an independent work. It may have been cut down from a larger composition – the left edge of the canvas is intact, while the other three sides appear to have been reduced (though we don't know by how much) – but what we see now is probably close to its original size.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was acquired in the 1930s by Kenneth Clark, Director of the National Gallery from 1934 to 1945, for his private collection. It did not come to the National Gallery until 1997, however, and was the first seventeenth-century Spanish still-life painting to enter our collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of only a dozen or so surviving pictures by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan de Zurbarán</a>, son of the celebrated Spanish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francisco de Zurbarán</a>. Although Juan is recorded as having painted religious works these have not survived, and he is known today exclusively as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still-life</a> painter. This work probably dates from the final years of Juan’s life, which came to an abrupt end when he died, aged 29, during the plague epidemic that hit Seville.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He depicts an array of objects with extraordinary delicacy and accuracy. At the centre stands a large wicker basket piled high with fresh lemons, seemingly just picked from a tree, their waxy green leaves still attached. Sprigs of flowers – lemon blossom, red carnations, blue delphiniums, white roses, day lilies and a tulip – are scattered throughout the composition. A goldfinch perches on the edge of a porcelain bowl filled with water, and a single day lily floats on the surface.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These objects are almost certainly intended to be symbolic. The water and lily both refer to the purity of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>; the same is true of the water and rose in Francisco de Zurbarán’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CFS-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Cup of Water and a Rose</a></span>. The goldfinch is often associated with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ’s Passion</a> and sacrifice. According to legend, the bird flew down towards Christ on the road to Calvary, the site of his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>, and plucked a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKD-0008-0000-0000.htm">thorn from his brow</a>, splashing its feathers with a drop of his blood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The porcelain bowl, which has a distinctive repeating motif of a deer, was made in China for export and reappears in another painting attributed to Francisco de Zurbarán, suggesting that it was in his studio. An example of the bowl, salvaged from a galleon that sunk off the Philippines in 1600, is in the Museo Naval, Madrid.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Juan delights in conveying the textures of the objects on display – coarse lemon rind, delicate flower petals, the reflective surface of the silver tazza. The objects are astonishingly realistic and the curling leaves create a sense of energy and movement throughout the composition. The basket, with its regular weave, appears in two other paintings by Juan, which are also dated to the late 1640s. In each of these paintings Juan adopts strong lighting effects, and the vivid colours of the fruit and foliage contrast with the stark setting and darkness behind.</p></div>
