Badalocchio may have drawn inspiration for his composition from a work by Annibale, and it has been suggested that a painting now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, may be Annibale’s original. According to Annibale’s two principal biographers, it was commissioned in 1594 by Astorre di Vincenzo Sampieri, a canon of the cathedral of Bologna, as a gift to an unidentified collector in Rome. Sampieri apparently left the choice of subject to Annibale, who decided on the burial for the opportunity it gave him to create a picture ‘filled with expression, with tears, with movement ... variety in showing young and old men and women and similar learned contrasts’. The picture was so successful that Sampieri decided to keep it for himself and sent a copy made by the young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guido Reni</a> to Rome instead. The popularity of Annibale’s design is demonstrated by the existence of numerous copies – at least ten survive, ascribed to different artists, including a fine example in Dulwich Picture Gallery, London. Badalocchio may have used Annibale’s design as a starting point for our painting and for his large canvas of 1618 for the Oratorio della Morte in Reggio Emilia, which exists today only in fragments in the Galleria Estense, Modena.</p></div>

The Cardinal had been deeply impressed by Annibale’s work on the Farnese Gallery – for which see the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HY8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Farnese Gallery cartoons</a> – and his personal secretary, Giovanni Battista Agucchi, knew Annibale well and may have been instrumental in the commission of this painting</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Annibale had done a preparatory study (now in the Albertina, Vienna) for a version of the subject by his pupil Taconi, painted on the vaulted ceiling of the Cerasi Chapel in Santa Maria del Popolo, Rome in 1600–01. In the drawing, Christ is fully clothed and Saint Peter kneeling. Annibale radically revised the design in this picture, rotating it to fit an upright panel, which had a dramatic effect on the composition.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is perhaps the most poignant image in the National Gallery’s collection of the pietà – the lamentation over the dead Christ following his crucifixion. It was a subject to which Annibale Carracci returned frequently, especially during the last decade of his life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, the limp and lifeless body of Christ lies in the lap of his mother, the Virgin Mary. A distraught Mary Magdalene kneels on the right, hands raised and mouth open in a wail of anguish. At the back an older woman in dark green reaches out towards the fainting Virgin, whose weight is supported by a fair-haired young woman.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is built on strong diagonals and our eye is guided around the picture by colour, gaze and expression.

Christ is filled with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, represented as a dove descending through a circle of naked winged cherubs. Translucent rays of light extend like spotlights from heaven. This moment of divine sanction was the beginning of Christ’s ministry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ is shown bending down in the river as John baptises him. The shape of his bent knees is mirrored by the folds of the red drapery being carried towards him by a large angel, which two cherubs prepare to wrap around him; its colour symbolises his divine kingship. With his left hand, Christ gestures towards the figure in the lower right corner who is removing a shoe. He is completely in shadow, but his silhouette is striking against the dazzling light of the rest of the scene. In a picture in which the divine is strongly associated with bright white light, he might be shown in darkness to represent the spiritual emptiness of those who have not yet been baptised. Behind him are a woman breastfeeding a baby, a Black man and – prominently highlighted by the trunk of a dead fir tree – a man in a turban (this was a traditional way to represent people from the East). He is prompted to watch the baptism by a figure dressed as a knight in a plumed headdress.  It has been suggested that these figures might represent Africa, Asia and Europe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ and John’s connection to each other is emphasised by the position of their right arms: they both seem to project into the viewer’s space, focusing attention on the most crucial element of the picture. Their left hands overlap at their wrists, closing off a semi-circle which rises through the sweeping curve of John’s left arm, leading the eye towards his face and right hand. The intense light from heaven has highlighted the muscles and sinews of Christ and John, and their dynamic poses make them appear like a strongly lit sculptural group. This is the first time that Elsheimer had included the naked body in a complex pose in his painting, and he may have been inspired by the work of his contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PLX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Johann Rottenhammer</a>, a fellow German painter who was also working in Venice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another German painter, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P2T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Altdorfer</a>, may have been the source of the ring of dancing angels. Altdorfer included the motif in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Nativity of the Virgin</span> (Alte Pinakothek, Munich), which Elsheimer may have seen in the south German city of Regensburg, the painting’s location in the sixteenth century.

Naked but for the shroud which will envelop him in the tomb, Christ’s lifeless body anchors the lower half of the composition. He lies back, his head resting limply against a stone block. His face is turned away towards the angel in the centre, who looks intently at him. The other angel is overwhelmed with sadness, his eyes turned downwards and his head leaning mournfully on his hand.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Guercino has not emphasised the horror of the Crucifixion – Christ’s wounds are barely visible and his youthful body appears luminous against the foreboding sky. A halo glimmers around Christ’s head, a sign of his divinity, but his lifeless body is a reminder of his humanity as he leaves his mortal life behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work is much smaller than others by Guercino, who is known primarily for his large-scale religious paintings. It was painted on copper, a material more expensive than canvas, and such pictures tend to be of reduced dimensions. They were primarily used for private devotion, and the subject of this painting, which encourages prayer and contemplation, reflects this. The copper support also gives the paint surface a fresh, textured quality – there are areas of thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>, such as in the highlights on the angels’ wings, where the artist’s brushwork stands out.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted around 1617–18, this work is characteristic of Guercino’s early style. The rich, earthy tones contribute to the soft but powerful contrast between light and shade. Although the overall colour palette is subdued, the vibrant red of the central angel’s robes stands out, as does the deep grey-blue placed next to the yellow ochre on the right – a colour combination typical of Guercino’s early works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is not known for whom Guercino painted this work, but it is first recorded in the Borghese Collection in Rome in 1693.

The Gospel of Luke says the Holy Ghost had told Simeon that he would not die until he had seen the Messiah. With the aged priest about to receive the infant Christ in his arms, Guercino captures the moments preceding this story’s climax. In the seconds that follow, Simeon recognises Christ and realises that his destiny has been fulfilled. Embracing death, he utters, ‘Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation’ (Luke 2: 29.)</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guercino</a> painted this work in 1623, shortly after returning to his native Cento from a two-year stay in Rome. During his time there he had seen the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a>, whose influence is apparent in the clearly defined planes and recession of space in this picture, as well as in the evenly dispersed light and vibrant use of colour. Architecture features more prominently here than in Guercino’s pre-Roman works, which are often crowded with figures tightly cropped by the picture frame (such as, for example, in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GC7-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Incredulity of Saint Thomas</a></span>). Guercino has used the architecture to carefully construct the space, and has paid attention to the decorative elements, including the stone steps and sculpted bas-relief on the altar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite some evolution, aspects of Guercino’s early style remain. The naturalistic, aged figure of Saint Joseph in the centre resembles Elijah from Guercino’s 1620 painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DC6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Elijah fed by Ravens</a></span>. With his aged, weathered face, Joseph presents a contrast to the young Virgin and infant Christ.

The painting was later returned to the artist in settlement of a debt.

Guercino eventually sold it in 1660 to Raphael Dufresne, who offered a substantial sum and presented the artist with an inscribed copy of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo da Vinci’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> Trattato della pittura </span> (Treatise on Painting).</p></div>
          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> brought the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, forty days after his birth, to be presented in the Temple in Jerusalem. According to Jewish custom, all first-born male children were to be taken to the Temple to be presented to God in a ceremony that involved the sacrifice of two doves or pigeons, which can be seen here at the foot of the altar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The elderly seated figure on the right is the high priest Simeon. The Gospel of Luke says the Holy Ghost had told Simeon that he would not die until he had seen the Messiah. With the aged priest about to receive the infant Christ in his arms, Guercino captures the moments preceding this story’s climax. In the seconds that follow, Simeon recognises Christ and realises that his destiny has been fulfilled. Embracing death, he utters, ‘Lord, now lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to thy word. For mine eyes have seen thy salvation’ (Luke 2: 29.)</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guercino</a> painted this work in 1623, shortly after returning to his native Cento from a two-year stay in Rome. During his time there he had seen the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a>, whose influence is apparent in the clearly defined planes and recession of space in this picture, as well as in the evenly dispersed light and vibrant use of colour. Architecture features more prominently here than in Guercino’s pre-Roman works, which are often crowded with figures tightly cropped by the picture frame (such as, for example, in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GC7-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Incredulity of Saint Thomas</a></span>). Guercino has used the architecture to carefully construct the space, and has paid attention to the decorative elements, including the stone steps and sculpted bas-relief on the altar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite some evolution, aspects of Guercino’s early style remain. The naturalistic, aged figure of Saint Joseph in the centre resembles Elijah from Guercino’s 1620 painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DC6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Elijah fed by Ravens</a></span>. With his aged, weathered face, Joseph presents a contrast to the young Virgin and infant Christ. His slightly dishevelled appearance and simple clothing are set against the immaculately dressed high priest. Simeon’s embroidered cope is remarkably similar to that of Saint Gregory in Guercino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CQ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Gregory the Great with Saints Ignatius Loyola and Francis Xavier.</a></span></p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is unusually large for a work on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1R-0008-0000-0000.htm">copper</a>.
