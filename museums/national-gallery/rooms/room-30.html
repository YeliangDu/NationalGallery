Bartholomew is the sole protagonist in this almost monochromatic, intensely psychological picture. Stark light illuminates the mantle and the flesh, which provides the only colour in a work otherwise composed of silvery grey tones. We are not confronted here with violence: rather, it is the threat and imminence of violence that is so menacing. White highlights gleam on the blade and handle of the knife; the rope, which will be used to bind the apostle, dangles ominously above. Instead of witnessing Bartholomew’s flayed flesh, the picture is dominated by the creamy mantle, whose folds are so elaborate that they cannot help but make us think of skin. Whether in the crisply delineated edges of the fabric or the strong sense of outline created by pulling the white paint right up to the flesh, everything seems to allude to layers and unpeeling, the act of incision unseen but ever-present. The skin itself is beautifully painted, the visible brushmarks on the shoulder, for example, giving it a strikingly realistic texture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the leading Neapolitan artists of the seventeenth century, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P15-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cavallino</a> was renowned for his harmonious colours, virtuoso brushwork and dramatic compositions. Extraordinarily little is known about his life, and only one of his paintings is signed and dated.

Although we do not know for whom he painted it, its size and grandeur suggest it was an important commission.

His white lace collar, shimmering silk sleeves and red sash stand out against his sombre black clothing and the non-descript background. This is a portrait of Don Adrián Pulido Pareja, a distinguished captain in the Spanish royal navy – his name is inscribed in Latin in the lower left corner, though this was probably added later. He fought against the French fleet in several major naval battles: near Fuenterrabía in 1638, near Cádiz in 1640 and off Cape St Vincent in 1641.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was painted in or after 1647, the year in which Don Adrián joined the Order of Santiago – the Knight’s badge, a gold medal decorated with a red cross in the shape of a sword, hangs off the sash across his chest. He holds a wide-brimmed hat in his left hand and grasps the wooden baton of a commander in his right. We can just see the hilt of his sword at his waist, a nod to his role within the military.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When the National Gallery bought this portrait at the end of the nineteenth century it was thought to be by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diego Velázquez</a>, whose name appears in the inscription centre left, along with the date ‘1639’. The handwriting is unlike any other signed painting by Velázquez and the inscription has been shown not to be original, but a similar painting by Velázquez probably did exist. His biographer Antonio Palomino described seeing a life-size portrait of Don Adrián bearing Velázquez’s signature and the date 1639. Some art historians have suggested that our picture is the work mentioned by Palomino, although Don Adrián did not receive his badge of honour until 1647, or it may be a copy after it by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo</a>, Velázquez’s son-in-law and principal assistant, who succeeded him as court painter to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV</a> after his death in 1660.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is skilfully executed, but on closer inspection the head and costume seem to lack Velázquez’s characteristically vibrant and economical handling of paint. If you compare Don Adrián’s silk sleeve with a similar detail in Velázquez’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FNW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain in Brown and Silver</a></span>, you can see how much more masterful the latter’s application of paint is. Even so, Mazo shows an accomplished familiarity with Velázquez’s technique. This includes the brush marks in the background, created by wiping excess paint off the brush – something for which Velázquez is especially known.</p></div>

Some art historians have suggested that our picture is the work mentioned by Palomino, although Don Adrián did not receive his badge of honour until 1647, or it may be a copy after it by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan Bautista Martínez del Mazo</a>, Velázquez’s son-in-law and principal assistant, who succeeded him as court painter to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV</a> after his death in 1660.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is skilfully executed, but on closer inspection the head and costume seem to lack Velázquez’s characteristically vibrant and economical handling of paint. If you compare Don Adrián’s silk sleeve with a similar detail in Velázquez’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FNW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain in Brown and Silver</a></span>, you can see how much more masterful the latter’s application of paint is. Even so, Mazo shows an accomplished familiarity with Velázquez’s technique. This includes the brush marks in the background, created by wiping excess paint off the brush – something for which Velázquez is especially known.</p></div>

        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was part of a series of six large paintings <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Murillo</a> made for the church of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville. The Caridad was a charitable brotherhood dedicated to helping the poor and sick; Murillo himself was a member.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted between 1667 and 1670, when the artist’s work was in high demand, the series was among the most important commissions that Murillo undertook for the city. It promotes six of the seven acts of charity described in the Gospel of Matthew: helping the sick, feeding the hungry, replenishing the thirsty, dressing the naked, sheltering the homeless, and visiting prisoners. The seventh act, burying the dead, is represented by a sculpture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHE-0008-0000-0000.htm">entombment</a> which forms part of the church’s high altar and remains there today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture shows the act of helping the sick. We see the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem, which was periodically visited by an angel – here hovering in the sky amid golden light. Whoever first touched the water after this would be cured of illness. Christ went to the pool, where he heard a sick man complain that someone always stepped into the water before him. Christ spoke to him – ‘Rise, take up thy bed and walk’ (John 5: 8) – and the man was cured. Christ’s gracefully outstretched arm invites the elderly man to stand; the eloquent mirroring of their hands captures the powerful connection between them. The man’s raised arms create an upward motion, as if he is being lifted from the ground by an invisible force – a visual evocation of the miracle taking place. Peter, John and a third <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> witness the event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We view the scene from beside the man, looking up towards the tall and dignified figure of Christ. His expressive face – the tense brow, widened eyes and open mouth (he is mid-complaint or stunned into silence) – leaves us in no doubt as to his despair. Murillo encourages us to adopt the same empathy as that visibly felt by Christ and his followers.

Here, the deep, rich tones of the robes of Christ and his apostles contrast with the rather monochromatic buildings beyond. Murillo’s use of perspective is particularly accomplished: the atmosphere becomes softer and hazier as our eye is led deeper into the scene, and areas of light and shade alternate throughout the composition.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was part of a series of six large paintings <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Murillo</a> made for the church of the Hospital de la Caridad in Seville. The Caridad was a charitable brotherhood dedicated to helping the poor and sick; Murillo himself was a member.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted between 1667 and 1670, when the artist’s work was in high demand, the series was among the most important commissions that Murillo undertook for the city. It promotes six of the seven acts of charity described in the Gospel of Matthew: helping the sick, feeding the hungry, replenishing the thirsty, dressing the naked, sheltering the homeless, and visiting prisoners. The seventh act, burying the dead, is represented by a sculpture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHE-0008-0000-0000.htm">entombment</a> which forms part of the church’s high altar and remains there today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture shows the act of helping the sick. We see the pool of Bethesda in Jerusalem, which was periodically visited by an angel – here hovering in the sky amid golden light. Whoever first touched the water after this would be cured of illness. Christ went to the pool, where he heard a sick man complain that someone always stepped into the water before him. Christ spoke to him – ‘Rise, take up thy bed and walk’ (John 5: 8) – and the man was cured. Christ’s gracefully outstretched arm invites the elderly man to stand; the eloquent mirroring of their hands captures the powerful connection between them. The man’s raised arms create an upward motion, as if he is being lifted from the ground by an invisible force – a visual evocation of the miracle taking place. Peter, John and a third <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> witness the event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We view the scene from beside the man, looking up towards the tall and dignified figure of Christ. His expressive face – the tense brow, widened eyes and open mouth (he is mid-complaint or stunned into silence) – leaves us in no doubt as to his despair. Murillo encourages us to adopt the same empathy as that visibly felt by Christ and his followers.

Christ’s pallor is striking – his lips and skin are turning grey-blue – and his body seems to radiate light, as does the white sheet beneath him. Christ’s hands and feet bear the wounds he suffered by being nailed to the Cross and his brow is smeared with the blood he shed from wearing the crown of thorns, a symbol of Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>.

Her golden tresses cascade over her back evoking the biblical passage in which she used them to wipe Christ’s feet in the house of Simon (Luke 7: 36–8). The scene is one of extreme pathos, enhanced by the sombre atmosphere and dramatic lighting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an early work painted by Ribera in Naples, where the artist had moved in 1616 after spending several years in Rome. The painting is thought to have been commissioned by the Genoese nobleman and collector Marcantonio Doria (1572–1651) in 1619 but was not delivered to him until 1623. Doria commissioned works from the leading artists of the day including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a>, whose works Ribera had had the opportunity to study in both Rome and Naples. Caravaggio’s style was to have a lasting influence on Ribera: here, the forceful chiaroscuro and naturalistic rendering of the body of Christ – surely modelled on a real person – are both inspired by him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the earliest representation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Lamentation</a> by Ribera. It relates stylistically to two other works he produced for the Collegiate Church of Osuna in Spain, both of which can be securely dated: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Crucifixion</span> (1618) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Sebastian</span> (1617–18). Saint Sebastian’s bare torso resembles that of Christ and all three paintings are dramatically illuminated, with the figures spot-lit against an almost pitch-black background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Technical examination</a> of this painting, including X-radiography, has revealed that Ribera originally painted Mary Magdalene’s face much closer to Christ’s right foot, in the act of kissing it. This gesture appears in other Lamentations by Ribera, such as those in the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid (1633) and the Certosa di San Martino in Naples (1637). It is not clear why Ribera changed his mind here, but he may have preferred not to have anything interfere with the pure outline of Christ’s body.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There has not always been general agreement about who painted this picture. Generally thought to be by Ribera until 1925, it was subsequently assigned to various artists including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PUM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Massimo Stanzione</a>, Nicolas Tournier and an anonymous seventeenth-century Sevillian painter. Ribera’s authorship was proposed again in 1952 but was not universally accepted until after the painting was cleaned in the 1990s.</p></div>

Saint Sebastian’s bare torso resembles that of Christ and all three paintings are dramatically illuminated, with the figures spot-lit against an almost pitch-black background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Technical examination</a> of this painting, including X-radiography, has revealed that Ribera originally painted Mary Magdalene’s face much closer to Christ’s right foot, in the act of kissing it. This gesture appears in other Lamentations by Ribera, such as those in the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid (1633) and the Certosa di San Martino in Naples (1637). It is not clear why Ribera changed his mind here, but he may have preferred not to have anything interfere with the pure outline of Christ’s body.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There has not always been general agreement about who painted this picture. Generally thought to be by Ribera until 1925, it was subsequently assigned to various artists including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PUM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Massimo Stanzione</a>, Nicolas Tournier and an anonymous seventeenth-century Sevillian painter. Ribera’s authorship was proposed again in 1952 but was not universally accepted until after the painting was cleaned in the 1990s.</p></div>

Mary sits at Christ’s feet, listening to him, and her sister Martha complains that she should not be left to serve the food alone. Christ replies: ‘Martha, Martha, thou art careful and troubled about many things.

Its relationship to the figures in the foreground is also debated; dressed in contemporary costume, they may be intended as a latter-day Martha and Mary. The elderly woman’s pointing finger suggests that we should perhaps think about how these two scenes – the everyday and the biblical – are connected.

We do not know who commissioned it. It may have been intended for a domestic setting, such as the home of the wealthy 3rd Duke of Alcalá, whose inventory of 1637 mentions a painting by Velázquez of ‘a kitchen where a woman is pounding garlic’ – though there is no reference to the religious subject in the background.

He was at the height of his career in the 1630s, having previously been appointed Bishop of Teruel (1625) and Bishop Elect of León (1632). Valdés’s noble expression conveys his power as a member of the Church and government. His grey beard and the dark circles under his eyes show his age – we see him in the later stages of his life and career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During his seven years in Madrid, Valdés commissioned a full-length seated portrait from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velázquez</a> (now lost); a copy of this painting survives in the Count of Toreno collection, Madrid. The bust-length portrait we see here, and another painting of a hand holding a letter signed by Velázquez, could be fragments from a larger, full-length work. Valdés died in 1639 and this is probably a posthumous portrait made during the 1640s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Velázquez used his skill as a portraitist to secure a position as court painter in 1623. During the 1620s and 1630s, he painted numerous portraits of Philip IV, other members of the royal family and various dignitaries present at court – two of them, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FNW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain in Brown and Silver</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain</a></span>, are in our collection.</p></div>

In spite of this the king, and wealthy Spanish art collectors in his circle, did own mythological paintings depicting nudes by artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, the goddess of love, reclines languidly on her bed, the curve of her body echoed in the sweep of sumptuous satin fabric beneath her, which was originally more purple than grey in tone. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, her son, holds a mirror up to her, its intertwining pink ribbons – used to hang it on a wall – knotted at the top.

Soon afterwards the painting was purchased by renowned art collector Gaspar de Haro, 7th Marqués del Carpio y de Heliche, in whose collection it was paired with a sixteenth-century Venetian picture of a naked nymph in a landscape, seen from the front. It hung in a large room alongside other mythological paintings and copies of works in the Spanish royal collection, to which Gaspar had privileged access thanks to his close relationship with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1687 the painting was inherited by Gaspar’s daughter, Catalina Méndez de Haro, who married Francisco Álvarez de Toledo, 10th Duke of Alba, shortly thereafter.

Her father, a pagan priest, cast her out when she converted to Christianity and she was left to fend for herself tending sheep. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Zurbarán</a> shows her holding a crook, with a brightly coloured saddlebag (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">alforjas</span>’) slung over her arm. She marks a page of her prayer book with one finger, suggesting she was in prayer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She is dressed as a wealthy shepherdess. Her white cotton shirt with curled collar and cuffs peeks through the sleeves of her blue woollen jacket (known as a ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">sayuelo</span>’). She wears a lambskin jacket (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">pellica</span>’) over her picturesque costume, and a wide-brimmed straw hat is fashionably cocked on her head. Her simple sandals are made of leather – you can see the stitching on them really clearly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Margaret seems oblivious to the snarling dragon crouched at her feet; she gazes directly towards us with a sober, determined expression. The creature is condemned to darkness behind the glowing saint.

She burst from its belly unharmed and later assumed the role of patron saint of childbirth, the dragon becoming her symbol.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The strong lighting emphasises the saint’s flawless skin and the vibrant colours and rich textures of her clothing, but also the scales on the dragon’s curled tail, its piercing eyes and pointed fangs. Her head and dress show the artist’s careful and smooth painting technique: the brushstrokes are particularly difficult to see in her skin tones. His attention to detail is obvious in the pattern and texture of her woven saddlebag, which is decorated with colourful stripes and geometric patterns.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike most of Zurbarán’s paintings of female saints, which were commissioned as series and largely painted by assistants, this one is entirely by the artist himself and does not appear to be part of a series. Zurbarán worked for churches and monasteries in and around Seville, where he lived from 1629, and in Extremadura. Many of his works were exported to South America: in 1647 he received an order for 24 paintings of virgin saints for Lima, Peru, and two years later he sent 15 paintings of the same subject to Buenos Aires, Argentina. During the 1640s he produced several series of virgin saints, but this one probably dates from the previous decade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Zurbarán’s intensely spiritual paintings perfectly express the ideas of the Counter-Reformation – compare this work with his other saints in our collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis in Mediation</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis in Meditation</a></span>.</p></div>
