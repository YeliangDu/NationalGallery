With a startled expression etched across his face, the boy is caught mid-motion, snatching his hand away from the unexpected pain. In the foreground is a magnificent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a> of cherries and plums, with a rose and sprig of jasmine arranged in a glass vase.

The scene might refer to the pain that can derive from love – a warning against the perils of love and the unexpected dangers that lurk behind beautiful things.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young man with curling locks, full lips and a rose tucked behind one ear, recoils in surprise at being bitten by a lizard, which clings tenaciously to his finger. With a startled expression etched across his face, the boy is caught mid-motion, snatching his hand away from the unexpected pain. In the foreground is a magnificent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a> of cherries and plums, with a rose and sprig of jasmine arranged in a glass vase.

With an economy typical of his mature works, Caravaggio has reduced the story to its essentials, focusing on the human tragedy.

The brutish executioner places John’s head on a salver held by Salome, whose serious expression and sidelong glance are enigmatic: is she turning away from the head in disgust or shame, appalled at the horror of what she has brought about? In contrast to the young and beautiful Salome is the elderly maidservant beside her, her face wrinkled with age and her hands clasped together in grief. The half-length format brings the figures up close, enhancing the dramatic impact of the scene. Although the composition appears simple and straightforward, it hides a sophisticated physical and psychological interplay between the main protagonists. Salome and the executioner are subtly linked by their poses – the angles of their heads echo each other and a strong raking light falls across their faces – but their role is very different.

As well as a vast canvas in St John’s Cathedral in Valletta, Malta, he produced a scene closely related to ours showing Salome with the Baptist’s head (Palacio Real, Madrid). The Madrid painting is the earlier of the two, probably dating from the artist’s first stay in Naples (1606–7), while the looser handling and pared down colours in our version – which lacks the bright red drapery enveloping Salome in the Madrid picture – suggests that it was painted in the final months of Caravaggio’s life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technically, this painting is typical of Caravaggio’s late style.

On the road they met the resurrected <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, but failed to recognise him. He questioned them about what had happened, and explained that Christ had to suffer in order to enter into his kingdom. That evening he joined them for supper and  ‘... took bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight’ (Luke 24: 30–31).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted at the height of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a>’s fame, this is among his most impressive domestic religious pictures and perhaps his most famous. It was commissioned from Caravaggio in 1601, following the sensation caused by the public unveiling of his first major religious works – the paintings of Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in the Roman church of San Luigi dei Francesi. The painting was made for Ciriaco Mattei (1542–1614) who, along with his brother Asdrubale (1554–1638), was an enthusiastic patron and protector of Caravaggio, commissioning three works from him in just two years (1601–2): our picture, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Taking of Christ </span> (on indefinite loan to the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint John the Baptist </span> (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Supper at Emmaus</span> soon left the Mattei collection and entered the possession of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, remaining in the Borghese collection in Rome until the early nineteenth century. It is one of three paintings by the artist in the National Gallery – the others being <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DHK-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Boy bitten by a Lizard</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salome receives the Head of John the Baptist</a></span> – and was the first to enter our collection in 1839.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Caravaggio captures the dramatic climax of the story, the moment of revelation when the disciples suddenly see what has been in front of them all along. Their actions convey their astonishment: one is about to leap out of his chair, his elbow jutting out towards us, while the other throws out his arms in a gesture of disbelief. Typically for Caravaggio, he has shown the disciples as ordinary working men, with bearded, lined faces and ragged clothes, in contrast to the youthful beardless Christ who, with his flowing locks and rich red tunic, seems quite literally to have come from a different world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the picture seems to capture a fleeting moment it is nevertheless carefully staged. The artist uses contrasts of light and shade (known as chiaroscuro) to heighten the drama. A strong light from the left falls on the faces of Christ and the disciple on the right, who is often identified as Saint Peter. It casts a shadow on the blank wall behind Christ, almost like a reverse  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN7-0008-0000-0000.htm">halo</a>, and illuminates the hand which the disciple thrusts towards the viewer, in a pose evoking Christ on the Cross during his crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The geometric structure which underlies the composition helps guide our eye around the picture.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the third day after the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> two of Jesus’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> were walking from Jerusalem to Emmaus. On the road they met the resurrected <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, but failed to recognise him. He questioned them about what had happened, and explained that Christ had to suffer in order to enter into his kingdom. That evening he joined them for supper and  ‘... took bread, and blessed it, and brake and gave to them. And their eyes were opened, and they knew him; and he vanished out of their sight’ (Luke 24: 30–31).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted at the height of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a>’s fame, this is among his most impressive domestic religious pictures and perhaps his most famous. It was commissioned from Caravaggio in 1601, following the sensation caused by the public unveiling of his first major religious works – the paintings of Saint Matthew in the Contarelli Chapel in the Roman church of San Luigi dei Francesi. The painting was made for Ciriaco Mattei (1542–1614) who, along with his brother Asdrubale (1554–1638), was an enthusiastic patron and protector of Caravaggio, commissioning three works from him in just two years (1601–2): our picture, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Taking of Christ </span> (on indefinite loan to the National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin), and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint John the Baptist </span> (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Supper at Emmaus</span> soon left the Mattei collection and entered the possession of Cardinal Scipione Borghese, remaining in the Borghese collection in Rome until the early nineteenth century. It is one of three paintings by the artist in the National Gallery – the others being <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DHK-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Boy bitten by a Lizard</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salome receives the Head of John the Baptist</a></span> – and was the first to enter our collection in 1839.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Caravaggio captures the dramatic climax of the story, the moment of revelation when the disciples suddenly see what has been in front of them all along. Their actions convey their astonishment: one is about to leap out of his chair, his elbow jutting out towards us, while the other throws out his arms in a gesture of disbelief. Typically for Caravaggio, he has shown the disciples as ordinary working men, with bearded, lined faces and ragged clothes, in contrast to the youthful beardless Christ who, with his flowing locks and rich red tunic, seems quite literally to have come from a different world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the picture seems to capture a fleeting moment it is nevertheless carefully staged. The artist uses contrasts of light and shade (known as chiaroscuro) to heighten the drama. A strong light from the left falls on the faces of Christ and the disciple on the right, who is often identified as Saint Peter. It casts a shadow on the blank wall behind Christ, almost like a reverse  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN7-0008-0000-0000.htm">halo</a>, and illuminates the hand which the disciple thrusts towards the viewer, in a pose evoking Christ on the Cross during his crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The geometric structure which underlies the composition helps guide our eye around the picture. The back view of the disciple on the left, thought to be Cleophas (the only apostle named in the Gospel), and the other disciple’s outstretched arms, shown in extreme foreshortening, act like tram lines focusing our attention on Christ’s serene face. He and the disciples form an inward-facing triangle, united in the moment of miraculous revelation. Unmoved, and standing outside it, is the innkeeper: his thumbs are tucked into his belt and he looks on impassively with his face in shadow, implying that he has not yet ’seen the light' – a metaphor for spiritual understanding.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The same light illuminates the astonishingly detailed and realistic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a> laid out on the crisp white tablecloth – loaves of rustic bread, a chicken, and a basket of fruit teetering dangerously on the edge of the table – and is both reflected in and refracted through the carafe of water and wine glass.

The diagonal slant of Susannah’s body is echoed by that of the leading elder, who stretches out his fingers to almost – but not quite – touch their victim. Susannah leans forward and to the right, clutching modestly at her robe which seems to be slipping through her fingers, while the elder in the background grabs at it, leaning his whole body backwards to add weight to his efforts to disrobe her.

        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Three Kings kneel before the  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, presenting their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. This is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a> as related in the Bible (Matthew 2: 11). The Kings have travelled from the East following the star which has led them to Bethlehem and the stable in which Christ was born.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the finest and most complex of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Carlo Dolci’s</a> versions of the subject. The Virgin sits serenely in the centre, the golden-haired child on her knee blessing the King who kneels before him, his turban on the ground beside him. The Kings are dressed in sumptuous robes: the one on the left, seen from behind, wears a turban and a jacket embroidered with flowers and trimmed with blue tassels; the one on the right has a gleaming gold crown studded with jewels.  The metal vessels containing the gifts are meticulously painted, as are the jewels which adorn the Kings‘ robes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is in superb condition: the richness of paint and refinement of detail are extraordinary. The Kings’ gifts appear gold but are executed in paint, while the haloes of the holy family are made of real (shell) gold, as is the light radiating from the Christ Child. This has the effect of making them glow in the darkness of the stable. The architectural details of the stable, the wooden rafters and stones of the door frame are painted with exemplary realism.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Through an opening on the right we can see the Kings‘ exotic retinue, including camels and more turbanned figures, and a mountainous landscape, evoking their long journey from the East. Peering round the door at far right is Dolci himself, wearing a red hat: his self portrait is recognisable from other paintings.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Three Kings kneel before the  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, presenting their gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh. This is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a> as related in the Bible (Matthew 2: 11). The Kings have travelled from the East following the star which has led them to Bethlehem and the stable in which Christ was born.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the finest and most complex of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Carlo Dolci’s</a> versions of the subject. The Virgin sits serenely in the centre, the golden-haired child on her knee blessing the King who kneels before him, his turban on the ground beside him. The Kings are dressed in sumptuous robes: the one on the left, seen from behind, wears a turban and a jacket embroidered with flowers and trimmed with blue tassels; the one on the right has a gleaming gold crown studded with jewels.  The metal vessels containing the gifts are meticulously painted, as are the jewels which adorn the Kings‘ robes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is in superb condition: the richness of paint and refinement of detail are extraordinary. The Kings’ gifts appear gold but are executed in paint, while the haloes of the holy family are made of real (shell) gold, as is the light radiating from the Christ Child. This has the effect of making them glow in the darkness of the stable. The architectural details of the stable, the wooden rafters and stones of the door frame are painted with exemplary realism.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Through an opening on the right we can see the Kings‘ exotic retinue, including camels and more turbanned figures, and a mountainous landscape, evoking their long journey from the East. Peering round the door at far right is Dolci himself, wearing a red hat: his self portrait is recognisable from other paintings. The painting remains on its original <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> and stretcher – an inscription on the reverse (in the artist’s own hand) tells us that the painting was commissioned in 1649, when Dolci was 33 years old.

During the infamous trial that followed, Artemisia testified and was tortured. After the trial she married and moved to Florence, where this painting was probably made. Saint Catherine’s facial features, the turn of her head and three-quarter pose, are all closely related to those in Artemisia’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self Portrait as a Lute Player</span> of about 1615–8 (Wadsworth Atheneum, Hartford, Connecticut).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Artemisia seems to have used her own image frequently in works she produced in Florence – a number of self-portraits are known and others are recorded in seventeenth-century inventories. New to the city and keen to demonstrate her talent, she may have painted these pictures in a conscious act of self-promotion. Many of Artemisia’s paintings, in particular those depicting a strong female heroine, have often been read in biographical terms.

The painting is contained in a tight square of approximately 70 cm and the saint is shown life-size and close up, against a plain background. She stands in the centre of the image, her head turned to gaze directly out at the viewer, while her body faces the wheel – the instrument of her torture. Only part of the wheel is visible and the close cropping adds to the intensity of the work, as does the theatrical lighting – a strong light from the right illuminates the claw-like spikes on the wheel, Catherine’s outstretched arm and the gleaming skin of her neck and shoulder. By contrast, the inside of the wheel and the folds of her dress are in deep shadow, the darkness to her right offsetting the light tones of her skin and turban.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perseus and Andromeda’s wedding feast has been violently interrupted by Phineus, to whom Andromeda was formerly betrothed. Giordano has illustrated the dramatic moment when Phineus and his followers attack Perseus. Heavily outnumbered, Perseus has unveiled the severed head of the gorgon Medusa, who he had recently slain. He averts his eyes, because all those who look on Medusa immediately turn to stone. His attackers have had no time to react, and Giordano has vividly portrayed their flesh turning from pink to stone grey.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Phineus is most likely the figure at the far left wearing the elaborate helmet and breastplate.

Heavily outnumbered, Perseus has unveiled the severed head of the gorgon Medusa, who he had recently slain. He averts his eyes, because all those who look on Medusa immediately turn to stone. His attackers have had no time to react, and Giordano has vividly portrayed their flesh turning from pink to stone grey.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Phineus is most likely the figure at the far left wearing the elaborate helmet and breastplate. His head and his whole left side are already stone grey and his mouth is frozen in a petrified scream, but his right arm and right leg are painted with pinkish hues, indicating that the transformation is not yet complete. His two companions are suffering a similar fate. One has already turned to stone, perhaps because he is closest to Medusa’s head. The upper body of the man in the foreground, seen from behind, is grey, but his legs are still pink with life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The striding figures of the attackers are statuesque, their feet firmly planted in the ground. Their solidity greatly contrasts with Perseus’s graceful pose and the movement suggested by his flowing costume, billowing drapery and the fluttering plumes in his hat. Giordano was no doubt aware of an ongoing debate – or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">paragone</span> – over whether painting or sculpture was the superior art form. He is making a clear reference to it here, and as a painter he is demonstrating the power of his art. Not only does he show Phineus and his companions from three different angles, as one would be able to view a sculpture in three-dimensions, but he also adopts a witty conceit for the portrayal of the petrified warriors.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The poses of two of them are based on antique sculptures, a fact which would not have been lost on Giordano’s contemporaries. Phineus’s striding figure echoes that of the famous ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Borghese Gladiator</span>’ (Louvre, Paris), then in Cardinal Scipione Borghese’s collection in Rome. The pose of the foreground warrior derives from the main figure of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Laocoön</a></span> (Vatican Museums), seen from behind.

Having predicted that a terrible drought would ravage the land, Elijah was instructed by God to hide on the banks of the stream Cherith.

The prophet sits awkwardly, his right leg jutting out from beneath his cloak and his body twisting as he turns his aged face expectantly toward the ravens. He clasps his cloak out in front of him, preparing to catch the food brought by the birds – they represent both physical and spiritual nourishment as Elijah places his faith in God’s commands.

        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">King David was a biblical warrior king, who ruled ancient Israel and Judah. Famous for defeating the giant Goliath, he was also a musician and poet, and he is credited with writing many of the Psalms in the Old Testament. The painting is an unusual representation of David, both within Guercino’s oeuvre and more generally. David is not young but not yet old. Vestiges of youth are suggested in his powerfully muscular calves, his pensive yet largely unlined face, and his glossy beard, unmarred with grey. He is presented as a warrior king, poised between his youthful career as a fighter, suggested by footwear that is reminiscent of armour, and his later life as a ruler, poet and philosopher, indicated by his staff, crown and inscribed tablet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David sits in a rare moment of introspection, looking towards a tablet inscribed with a line from Psalm 86 (87 in the King James and Hebrew Bibles): ‘Glorious things of thee are spoken, O City of God’ (GLORIOSA / DICTA SVNT / DE TE CIVITAS / DEI). David had conquered Jerusalem, but God had not permitted him to build a temple there because of his bloody deeds as a warrior. Here, David contemplates Jerusalem’s glorious future which he will not witness during his lifetime. It is a moving image of a man at a turning point in his life, reckoning with his history and his limits. The luminous colouring and complex psychology exemplify Guercino’s assurance as a painter at the height of his maturity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was commissioned in 1651 by Giuseppe Locatelli of Cesena, together with a painting of one of the ancient Sibyls. The pairing of King David with a Sibyl had its precedent in medieval hymns; both were considered prophets of the coming of Christ. Locatelli was only twenty-four years old at the time and had recently come into his inheritance following the death of his father in 1649.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">King David was a biblical warrior king, who ruled ancient Israel and Judah. Famous for defeating the giant Goliath, he was also a musician and poet, and he is credited with writing many of the Psalms in the Old Testament. The painting is an unusual representation of David, both within Guercino’s oeuvre and more generally. David is not young but not yet old. Vestiges of youth are suggested in his powerfully muscular calves, his pensive yet largely unlined face, and his glossy beard, unmarred with grey. He is presented as a warrior king, poised between his youthful career as a fighter, suggested by footwear that is reminiscent of armour, and his later life as a ruler, poet and philosopher, indicated by his staff, crown and inscribed tablet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David sits in a rare moment of introspection, looking towards a tablet inscribed with a line from Psalm 86 (87 in the King James and Hebrew Bibles): ‘Glorious things of thee are spoken, O City of God’ (GLORIOSA / DICTA SVNT / DE TE CIVITAS / DEI). David had conquered Jerusalem, but God had not permitted him to build a temple there because of his bloody deeds as a warrior. Here, David contemplates Jerusalem’s glorious future which he will not witness during his lifetime. It is a moving image of a man at a turning point in his life, reckoning with his history and his limits. The luminous colouring and complex psychology exemplify Guercino’s assurance as a painter at the height of his maturity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was commissioned in 1651 by Giuseppe Locatelli of Cesena, together with a painting of one of the ancient Sibyls. The pairing of King David with a Sibyl had its precedent in medieval hymns; both were considered prophets of the coming of Christ. Locatelli was only twenty-four years old at the time and had recently come into his inheritance following the death of his father in 1649. These paintings were intended as decorations for the remodelled family home.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">King David</span> was completed first.

Both Jesuit saints are dressed in the simple black habit of their monastic order, placing them in contrast with the Pope in his brocaded cope. The carved stone plinth on which the Pope is seated is partly in shadow, as is the ornate jewelled tiara near the base of the picture.

Here, books are included in the foreground, at the putto’s feet, and in the Sibyl’s hands. The Cumaean Sibyl is referred to several times in classical literature, including in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgil’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aeneid</span>, and was one of the most commonly featured sibyls in Italian art. The sibyls became particularly popular subjects in the seventeenth century and Guercino, like Domenichino, painted numerous pictures of them throughout his career, especially in the late 1640s and early 1650s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The warm tones in this painting are achieved through Guercino’s use of an orange-brown <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, exposed and visible near the lower right corner of the stone tablet. The range of delicate colours is punctuated by accents of blue in the Sibyl’s cloak and hairband, and in the cloudy sky at upper left. Through his rendering of fabric, the artist has endowed the Sibyl with a great sense of monumentality. Her green stole is tucked into her bodice and winds itself around her shoulders and right arm, to rest on the cloak lying over her lap. Her bright, peach-coloured sleeve, whose folds are wonderfully modelled, draws our attention to the centre of the painting and our eye is led to the fine details of the Sibyl’s dress, such as the embellished velvet band running across her neckline. The putto’s cloak, too, billows out dramatically behind him, further demonstrating Guercino’s skill in articulating drapery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was commissioned in 1651 by Gioseffo Locatelli of Cesena as a companion to Guercino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">King David</span>, now in a private collection.

The Cumaean Sibyl is referred to several times in classical literature, including in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgil’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aeneid</span>, and was one of the most commonly featured sibyls in Italian art. The sibyls became particularly popular subjects in the seventeenth century and Guercino, like Domenichino, painted numerous pictures of them throughout his career, especially in the late 1640s and early 1650s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The warm tones in this painting are achieved through Guercino’s use of an orange-brown <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, exposed and visible near the lower right corner of the stone tablet. The range of delicate colours is punctuated by accents of blue in the Sibyl’s cloak and hairband, and in the cloudy sky at upper left. Through his rendering of fabric, the artist has endowed the Sibyl with a great sense of monumentality. Her green stole is tucked into her bodice and winds itself around her shoulders and right arm, to rest on the cloak lying over her lap. Her bright, peach-coloured sleeve, whose folds are wonderfully modelled, draws our attention to the centre of the painting and our eye is led to the fine details of the Sibyl’s dress, such as the embellished velvet band running across her neckline. The putto’s cloak, too, billows out dramatically behind him, further demonstrating Guercino’s skill in articulating drapery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was commissioned in 1651 by Gioseffo Locatelli of Cesena as a companion to Guercino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">King David</span>, now in a private collection. Before the canvas could be sent to Locatelli, it was seen in Guercino’s studio by Prince Mattias de' <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, who convinced the artist to sell it to him instead. Guercino painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0MG0-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Samian Sibyl with a Putto</a></span> for the original patron as a replacement. That Guercino chose to produce a new composition rather than an identical copy is a testament to his originality as a painter.</p></div>

In the inventory of the Giustiniani family made up in 1638, it is recorded as Christ before the priest Caiaphas. Another argument suggests that Christ is before Annas, a different priest before whom Christ was brought for judgement.

When her hometown of Bethulia was besieged by Assyrian forces, Judith infiltrated the enemy camp. Disarmed by her looks, the soldiers believed her when she offered them assistance. She gained entry to the tent of the Assyrian general Holofernes, and when he was drunk after a banquet she seized his sword and cut off his head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Liss shows the moment immediately afterwards, with Judith placing Holofernes‘ head into a sack held open by her maid; the white of his upturned right eyeball is just visible. Her gaze is steely and resolute as she turns to look at the viewer, but her cheeks are flushed, her skin shiny with sweat and her fleshy lips glossy. Tendrils of hair in a spiral have escaped from her turban and rest against the smooth flesh of her neck. Judith’s body is partly bare – the exertion has loosened her chemise, revealing her back and shoulders. Holofernes is half-naked, with only his wrinkled bed sheets covering the lower part of his body. These hints of sensuality reflect the intimacy of the murder, which took place when the two were alone at night in the tent: Holofernes believed that Judith was trying to seduce him, not kill him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is impossible to avoid the streams of blood, so thick that they catch the light, gushing relentlessly from Holofernes’ mutilated neck, depicted more squarely than Judith’s face. His muscular torso is cast partly in shadow by her body, highlighting the juxtaposition of their brightly lit left arms. His muscles are echoed by the billowing folds of her voluminous sleeves, emphasising the victory of feminine guile over masculine strength.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Their limbs and bodies are positioned so that they create a continuous circle up through the sweeping curve of Judith’s body, through the three heads – Judith’s, the maid’s and Holofernes‘– and down to Holofernes’ bloodied wound, along his right arm and back to Judith. Her thick silk draperies and the creamy texture of her thickly painted turban contrast with the yellow sheen of Holofernes' corpse and the glint of his cold armour at the very bottom of the picture. Contemporary viewers would have known that, according to the Book of Judith, she remained pure and undefiled, the chastity of her conquest making her victory all the more righteous.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The events following the destruction of the sinful city of Sodom, from which Lot and his daughters are here shown fleeing, are recounted in the Old Testament (Genesis 19: 30–38). Forewarned of the city’s demise by God, the trio escaped to the mountain town of Zoar. We see them in a moment of conversation, perhaps contemplating their next move – the daughter on the right raises her right index finger, while her father opens his palm, as if in response, and his other daughter looks on.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Conspicuously absent from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reni’s</a> composition are narrative details typically associated with the subject and common in other seventeenth-century depictions of it: Sodom burning in the background, for example, or Lot’s wife as a pillar of salt (her punishment for disobeying instructions not to look back at the doomed city). Later in the biblical account, the daughters ply their father with alcohol and seduce him, in order to ensure the survival of their family line.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This subject enjoyed renewed popularity in Europe after the Council of Trent, not least because it provided a just, moral context in which to illustrate a social taboo. While many artists seized this as an opportunity to paint a scene rife with eroticism and nudity, Reni deviated from such tradition by illustrating the family as fully clothed, sober and chaste. The monumental figure of Lot in the centre of the composition is not that of a helpless, drunken, old man, but rather a powerful patriarchal figure.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The events following the destruction of the sinful city of Sodom, from which Lot and his daughters are here shown fleeing, are recounted in the Old Testament (Genesis 19: 30–38). Forewarned of the city’s demise by God, the trio escaped to the mountain town of Zoar. We see them in a moment of conversation, perhaps contemplating their next move – the daughter on the right raises her right index finger, while her father opens his palm, as if in response, and his other daughter looks on.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Conspicuously absent from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reni’s</a> composition are narrative details typically associated with the subject and common in other seventeenth-century depictions of it: Sodom burning in the background, for example, or Lot’s wife as a pillar of salt (her punishment for disobeying instructions not to look back at the doomed city). Later in the biblical account, the daughters ply their father with alcohol and seduce him, in order to ensure the survival of their family line.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This subject enjoyed renewed popularity in Europe after the Council of Trent, not least because it provided a just, moral context in which to illustrate a social taboo. While many artists seized this as an opportunity to paint a scene rife with eroticism and nudity, Reni deviated from such tradition by illustrating the family as fully clothed, sober and chaste. The monumental figure of Lot in the centre of the composition is not that of a helpless, drunken, old man, but rather a powerful patriarchal figure. The large antique vase held by the daughter on the left, probably filled with wine, and the drapery gathered around the other daughter’s midriff, which makes her appear pregnant, may serve as subtle indicators of the events that were soon to follow.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made around the time of Reni’s celebrated <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aurora</span> fresco in Rome, where he lived and worked for more than a decade; the statuesque figures and solid handling of paint are illustrative of the style that he had developed there.

Celestial light seems to spill from the heavens through a gap in the clouds surrounded by a group of joyful putti. The scroll they carry reads: GLORIA IN ECCELSIS DEO (‘Glory to God in the highest’). The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration</span> was a popular devotional subject addressed frequently by artists in Europe in the seventeenth century and in the preceding centuries. The subject has been interpreted by different artists with great variety – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EEM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolas Poussin’s representation</a>, for example, sets the scene in daylight and depicts the holy family in a stable built among classical ruins.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work was completed in Reni’s final years and is recorded by his biographer, Carlo Cesare Malvasia, as one of the paintings left in the artist’s studio at the time of his death. Many of these works were left unfinished when Reni died in 1642, though the loose, painterly brushwork of his late style often makes it difficult to tell which works are finished and which are not. Reni has used a deep blue for the Virgin’s drapery and bright orange and blue for Joseph’s robes – a deliberate use of complementary colours that highlights the distinction between the holy family and the shepherds, whose garments are more sombre. Reni has used a high-quality variety of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> ultramarine for the blue of the Virgin’s robes. Considered to be the most expensive pigment on an artist’s palette – at one time worth more by weight than gold – the purest ultramarine would often be reserved for depictions of the Virgin, as in Sassoferrato’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4I-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin in Prayer</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to Malvasia, the majority of the paintings that remained in Reni’s studio upon his death were either sold or delivered to the client who commissioned them by the executor of the artist’s will. This painting is one of two very late large-scale treatments of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration of the Shepherds</span> by Reni; the other was painted for the Certosa di San Martino in Naples (where it remains). The paintings are close in date, but show some variations between their compositions. Malvasia names the two works as examples of great altarpieces created by Reni at the end of his career, describing the National Gallery work as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">per germania</span>’ (for Germany). It is possible that the painting was commissioned by Prince Karl Eusebius von Liechtenstein (1611–1684), or that the prince acquired it from Reni’s studio following the dispersal of its contents after the artist’s death. The painting hung in the royal chapel at the castle in Feldsberg, before being moved to the family’s palace in Vienna in 1706. It was purchased from the prince’s descendants by the National Gallery in 1957.</p></div>

The National Gallery painting has been identified as that which, according to Malvasia, was made for the King of Poland shortly before 1640, during Reni’s final years. Early in 1640, the King wrote to Reni from Warsaw: ‘it is not possible for us to express by any means other than our letters how pleased we are with the Europa... and how great is the esteem we have of your renowned ability.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, we see the moment before Europa’s alarm at being abducted turns to love.

During this time, according to Malvasia, Reni moved away from the ‘forced shadows’ or shadows that ‘are caused by the light that is too artificial’ (as exemplified by the chiaroscuro technique used by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a> and his followers).

It is taken from Aesop’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fables</span>, a collection of ancient Greek tales with moral lessons. In the story, the god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a> takes pity on a woodsman who has accidentally dropped his axe into a river. He retrieves two axes from the water, one gold and one silver; the woodsman claims neither as his own and, as a reward for his honesty, Mercury gives him both, along with the original axe. On hearing this a dishonest woodsman threw his own tool in the river and pretended that it was made of precious metal. Rosa’s painting shows Mercury in his winged helmet emerging from the water holding a golden axe, and the woodsman dashing forwards to claim it. The god, disgusted by the man’s dishonesty, denied him the axe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like many themes selected by Rosa, this one has a strong moral message: the virtue of honesty, even at the price of self interest. Rosa was familiar with many of Aesop’s stories; he included references to the author’s work in his satirical poetry, and a volume by Aesop is depicted in his painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Moral Philosophy</span> (private collection). Rosa became increasingly interested in classical philosophy through the group of intellectuals he befriended in Rome during the 1650s and 1660s. He longed to be accepted as a painter of philosophical subjects and greatly resented his reputation as a specialist in landscape and genre scenes. But his dark and awe-inspiring late landscapes, like this one, are among his most powerfully inventive works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the 1660s, Rosa’s style became increasingly dramatic and turbulent, characterised by stormy clouds, rushing torrents of water and windswept trees that loom threateningly over small figures. In contrast to Rosa’s earlier landscapes, which took inspiration from the balanced and harmonious work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicholas Poussin</a>, his contemporaries in Rome, this untamed and hostile scene is theatrical and dynamic. The figures seem tiny and insubstantial beneath the dark, voluminous clouds and masses of dense foliage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was commissioned around 1663 by Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna, a major collector of landscape painting in Rome. In the dramatic posing of the figures and the contrast between the dark foreground and blue distant mountains, there are similarities with the late works of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ORX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dughet</a>, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with Elijah and the Angel</a></span>, which also entered Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna’s collection during the early 1660s.

Rosa took inspiration from the philosophers, scientists and actors he met in Florence and Rome, many of whom shared his fascination with dark and disturbing subjects, such as the one explored in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EBQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Witches at their Incantations</a></span>. He wished to be recognised as a painter of philosophical subjects rather than a specialist in types of art considered inferior at the time, like landscapes and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre</a> scenes. To his frustration, this was a reputation he never quite achieved, and he was most original as a landscape artist.</p></div>

This composition is based on an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGD-0008-0000-0000.htm">etching</a> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guido Reni</a>, a seventeenth-century painter from Bologna whose work deeply influenced Sassoferrato. However, Sassoferrato’s style, with its intense colours, soft modelling of form, and highly finished, enamel-like quality, is most deeply indebted to earlier artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>. We know that he produced copies after these masters' works (the National Gallery owns a copy after Perugino that is probably by Sassoferrato: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHX-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Baptism of Christ</a></span>), and used elements from their paintings and drawings in his own compositions. Sassoferrato was so closely linked to these artists that his popularity in the nineteenth century was in part thanks to a renewed interest in the work of Raphael. He in turn may have influenced the Pre-Raphaelites.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like his contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dolci</a>, Sassoferrato produced multiple versions of his smaller paintings, which could be sold to private patrons. The relatively small size of this picture, the tender relationship between mother and child and the intimate, somewhat domestic nature of the setting suggest that it was intended for private devotion. It may never have been delivered to its patron, however, since it was probably one of a group of late works left in Sassoferrato’s studio at his death in 1685. The painting is thought to have passed to his son, Alessio Salvi, and then to Salvi’s granddaughter, remaining in the family until the early nineteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4I-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin in Prayer</a></span> were both acquired by the National Gallery in the mid-nineteenth century, when Sassoferrato’s star was high in the London art world. The bright colours of both pictures were initially toned down by the Gallery using tinted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR1-0008-0000-0000.htm">varnish</a> and overpainted with cobalt blue to better align with the Victorian taste for more subdued colouring. When this picture was cleaned in 1986, these layers were removed, and the Virgin’s dazzling ultramarine robe and the vivid green curtain can now be appreciated as the artist originally intended.</p></div>

Through an archway, we see <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Joseph</a> coming towards the house and, behind him, a view of distant mountains.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QC7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassoferrato</a> was born Giovanni Battista Salvi and took his nickname from the town of his birth, but he spent the majority of his career working in Rome, where his immaculately polished paintings were consciously anachronistic. This composition is based on an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGD-0008-0000-0000.htm">etching</a> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guido Reni</a>, a seventeenth-century painter from Bologna whose work deeply influenced Sassoferrato. However, Sassoferrato’s style, with its intense colours, soft modelling of form, and highly finished, enamel-like quality, is most deeply indebted to earlier artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>. We know that he produced copies after these masters' works (the National Gallery owns a copy after Perugino that is probably by Sassoferrato: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHX-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Baptism of Christ</a></span>), and used elements from their paintings and drawings in his own compositions. Sassoferrato was so closely linked to these artists that his popularity in the nineteenth century was in part thanks to a renewed interest in the work of Raphael. He in turn may have influenced the Pre-Raphaelites.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like his contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dolci</a>, Sassoferrato produced multiple versions of his smaller paintings, which could be sold to private patrons. The relatively small size of this picture, the tender relationship between mother and child and the intimate, somewhat domestic nature of the setting suggest that it was intended for private devotion. It may never have been delivered to its patron, however, since it was probably one of a group of late works left in Sassoferrato’s studio at his death in 1685. The painting is thought to have passed to his son, Alessio Salvi, and then to Salvi’s granddaughter, remaining in the family until the early nineteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4I-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin in Prayer</a></span> were both acquired by the National Gallery in the mid-nineteenth century, when Sassoferrato’s star was high in the London art world. The bright colours of both pictures were initially toned down by the Gallery using tinted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR1-0008-0000-0000.htm">varnish</a> and overpainted with cobalt blue to better align with the Victorian taste for more subdued colouring. When this picture was cleaned in 1986, these layers were removed, and the Virgin’s dazzling ultramarine robe and the vivid green curtain can now be appreciated as the artist originally intended.</p></div>

It was there that he was nicknamed ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">il prete Genovese</span>’ (‘the Genoese priest’) because he belonged to the Capuchin Order (though he was granted permission to leave the monastery of San Barnaba in Genoa in 1610 to care for his ailing mother and unmarried sister, and subsequently swapped his monk’s habit for that of a priest). The bright colourful palette and virtuoso brushwork evident on Fame’s skirt and white shirt are typical of Strozzi’s technique.
