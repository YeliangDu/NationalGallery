It must be shortly after dawn: the sun is rising in the east and a cockerel crows on a windowsill to the left of this scene. Workmen chisel away at pieces of stone scattered across the foreground and in front of a simple wooden hut on the right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This square – the Campo San Vidal – was not usually a mason’s yard: it appears to have been temporarily transformed into a workshop while repairs are done to the nearby church of San Vidal. The blocks of Istrian stone – a dense limestone commonly used for buildings in Venice – must have been brought by water to the square. Everyday life continues around the labouring stonemasons. To the left, a mother rushes to comfort her child who has fallen backwards, and is watched by both her daughter and the nosy neighbour airing the bedding out of the window above. On the balcony of the house to the right, a woman sits spinning yarn and observing the activity below. Beside the wooden hut, another woman scoops water from the well (which still exists in the square today). Sunlight catches intricate details, like the masons’ tools and the plant pots precariously balanced on the balcony to the right, and casts powerful shadows, with steep diagonals that define the depth of space and articulate the receding architecture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beyond the square is the Grand Canal, which appears rather less grand than usual when viewed from this angle. Canaletto’s paintings of the canal more often show its full breadth, making use of its natural perspective to lead our eye into the distance – see, for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CV3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: The Grand Canal with S. Simeone Piccolo</a></span>. Here, gondoliers await their first passengers of the day, while one boat crosses the smooth green water. On the far side of the canal, a priest emerges from a doorway and women hang out their washing. Behind is the campanile (bell tower) and north side of the church of Saint Maria della Carità, with the facade of the Scuola della Carità in its shadow to the right. Among the jumbled roofs and chimneys is the white campanile of the church of San Trovaso. A mass of grey cloud looms overhead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We view the scene from a high position on a level with the first-floor balconies, but Canaletto does not appear to have altered the topography or combined different viewpoints – as he did in many of his works, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D7L-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Regatta on the Grand Canal</a></span> – to achieve the ideal perspective. There are no preliminary drawings or other painted versions of this composition. The view has changed substantially since Canaletto’s lifetime. Today, it is dominated by a wooden bridge that crosses the canal from this point in the square; the church and Scuola now house the Accademia art gallery. The most dramatic change is the absence of Saint Maria della Carità’s campanile, which collapsed in 1744, demolishing the two small houses in front of it, and was never rebuilt. The facade of the Scuola Grande della Carità was replaced in 1760. Although the house on the far right still stands, the one to the left was demolished during the nineteenth century to give space to a garden for the Palazzo Cavalli.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Canaletto probably painted this work in the late 1720s when construction on the facade of San Vidal was nearing completion. A drawing by the artist of around 1730 (Royal Collection, Windsor Castle) shows the same group of houses that appear on the far right here, but the square is empty and the workman’s hut is absent. This is considered one of Canaletto’s finest early pictures, and the bold composition, the densely applied paint and the highly individualised figures are characteristic of his work of the mid- to late 1720s. During this period, he typically made use of a brick-coloured <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> in some parts of the composition, which gives a richness and intensity to the final paint layers. By around 1730 he began to cover the entire picture with a uniform layer of grey or beige to produce a cooler, misty tonality. With skilful handling of paint he has described the crumbling plaster, exposed brick and rough timber in browns, ochre, reds and pinks – all are captured with brushstrokes that mimic the textures and materials they represent. The curtains blowing in the breeze, the weather-beaten stone and washing line in the distance were painted using touches of bright white <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>. The buildings of different styles and heights, the animated figures and the alternating areas of light and shadow may recall the stage sets Canaletto painted alongside his father at the very beginning of his career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view of the Grand Canal would probably not have appealed to tourists, who favoured the ‘picture postcard’ panoramic views of famous squares and landmarks for which Canaletto later became known, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECD-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Basin of San Marco on Ascension Day</a></span>. Although the early whereabouts of this painting remains a mystery, one theory is that it may have been made for a local Venetian. This painting was acquired in 1808 by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QXA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir George Beaumont</a>, an avid art collector and a driving force behind the creation of the National Gallery.

Perched on a barrel, a man turns his head towards us, while another peeps out from behind a pillar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The archway focuses attention on the buildings beyond: a frontal view of the Basilica di San Marco, the city’s most sacred church – it housed the relics of Saint Mark the Evangelist – and to the right, its elegant campanile (bell tower). Canaletto drew and painted the campanile numerous times, but he nearly always showed it as taller and more slender than it was in reality. Between the campanile and the column in front of us, we catch a tiny glimpse of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Doge’s Palace</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paving stones and buildings that line the square recede at a sharp angle, which Canaletto exaggerated, leading our eye deeper into the scene.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beneath a sky of swirling cloud and warm sunlight, we take in a view of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Doge</a>’s Palace, one of the best-known buildings in Venice. It overlooks a promenade called the Riva degli Schiavoni and the basin of San Marco. The Riva degli Schiavoni is named after the Slavic people from Dalmatia – present-day Croatia – who settled in this part of the city. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a> has given the scene a sense of tranquillity and calm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While Canaletto sometimes captured important ceremonies taking place along the waterfront – see <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECD-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Basin of San Marco on Ascension Day</a></span>, for example – his subject here is the city in a quieter moment. A group of idle sailors surround the column of San Marco; one of them, hands on his hips and stood beside a barrel, is eager to explore his new surroundings. Nearby, we see merchants and foreign visitors, perhaps recently arrived from ports around the Mediterranean or beyond. Just in front of us and to the right, several boatmen pause for a moment to look out over the lagoon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The churches and houses beyond the palace are laid out at a steeply receding angle, and the roof of the palace creates a line of glossary:perspective. Back on street level, this device leads our eye back towards the groups of Venetians on a leisurely walk, an old man with a walking stick and government officials in black robes, and then a knife-grinder beside a simple wooden hut. Precise brushstrokes describe the outfits and poses of the foreground figures. The palette is dominated by browns and blues, punctuated by the vivid red of hats and touches of yellow and white for the clothing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are positioned just above the quayside so that the watercraft – sailing boats, barges, gondolas, galleys, and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fusta</span> (single-masted boat) covered in a red and gold striped awning – fill the right-hand side of the composition; the water is barely visible. From up close, the varied brushwork becomes apparent that Canaletto used to describe different textures and materials, particularly the splintered and broken timbers and pieces of stone littering the water’s edge. Thick layers of paint (<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>) combined with areas of thinner, almost transparent, paint create the white sail on the right, capturing the form of the cloth and the effects of light on it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, Canaletto paints one of Venice’s most iconic waterfront vistas. He repeatedly used ordinary Venetians and parts of the city that were popular among tourists as inspiration. They were also painted by Canaletto’s contemporaries, among them his nephew and talented pupil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P0B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bernardo Bellotto</a>, and later in the century by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q34-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francesco Guardi</a>.</p></div>

The Riva degli Schiavoni is named after the Slavic people from Dalmatia – present-day Croatia – who settled in this part of the city. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a> has given the scene a sense of tranquillity and calm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While Canaletto sometimes captured important ceremonies taking place along the waterfront – see <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECD-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Basin of San Marco on Ascension Day</a></span>, for example – his subject here is the city in a quieter moment. A group of idle sailors surround the column of San Marco; one of them, hands on his hips and stood beside a barrel, is eager to explore his new surroundings. Nearby, we see merchants and foreign visitors, perhaps recently arrived from ports around the Mediterranean or beyond. Just in front of us and to the right, several boatmen pause for a moment to look out over the lagoon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The churches and houses beyond the palace are laid out at a steeply receding angle, and the roof of the palace creates a line of glossary:perspective. Back on street level, this device leads our eye back towards the groups of Venetians on a leisurely walk, an old man with a walking stick and government officials in black robes, and then a knife-grinder beside a simple wooden hut. Precise brushstrokes describe the outfits and poses of the foreground figures. The palette is dominated by browns and blues, punctuated by the vivid red of hats and touches of yellow and white for the clothing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are positioned just above the quayside so that the watercraft – sailing boats, barges, gondolas, galleys, and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fusta</span> (single-masted boat) covered in a red and gold striped awning – fill the right-hand side of the composition; the water is barely visible. From up close, the varied brushwork becomes apparent that Canaletto used to describe different textures and materials, particularly the splintered and broken timbers and pieces of stone littering the water’s edge. Thick layers of paint (<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>) combined with areas of thinner, almost transparent, paint create the white sail on the right, capturing the form of the cloth and the effects of light on it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, Canaletto paints one of Venice’s most iconic waterfront vistas. He repeatedly used ordinary Venetians and parts of the city that were popular among tourists as inspiration. They were also painted by Canaletto’s contemporaries, among them his nephew and talented pupil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P0B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bernardo Bellotto</a>, and later in the century by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q34-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francesco Guardi</a>.</p></div>

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Richly dressed state dignitaries and foreign ambassadors emerge from a church on the right side of this painting. A mass of people have gathered to watch the grand procession; most of them have their backs to us, giving the impression that we too are part of the crowd, stood just behind them. We are witnessing the feast day of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Roch</a>, held every year on 16 August to celebrate his role in bringing the plague of 1576 to an end.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On this day it was customary for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">doge</a> of Venice to attend mass in the church of San Rocco, where the saint’s relics were revered. The men in the procession all carry nosegays, a sweet-scented bunch of flowers originally intended to mask unpleasant smells, as a memorial to the plague. Canaletto has used energetic brushwork and thick accents of paint to describe their hair and their ceremonial robes. The doge himself is dressed in a golden, ermine-lined ceremonial robe, a cap and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">rensa</span> (a white linen head-cloth); we think this painting was made in around 1735, which means that he could be the newly elected Doge Alvise Pisani. To his left is the French ambassador, and to his right, a representative of the papal embassy, wearing a black cape with a hood (known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">mozzetta</span>). In front of them are the scarlet-clad grand chancellor, two servants who carry an upholstered chair and a cushion, and three secretaries in purple garments. A canvas awning above the group provides shade, and its horizontal line creates an undulating rhythm across the lower composition that accentuates the movement of the procession.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sunlight catches faces in the crowd and those in the procession at different angles. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a> developed a particular way of painting large numbers of faces – he used highlights on the forehead and cheeks to show how each head was angled in relation to the light, with dots for the eyes, chin and nose. Some figures have individual characteristics, like those at the head of the procession, the two men walking towards us on the far left or the man standing opposite a vendor with weighing scales, his face in full sunlight. Even those facing away from us have personality, expressed through pose and outfit. In the foreground, we see a beggar in a ragged brown cloak accompanied by a small boy who bends over, possibly thinking about picking a pocket. Nearby, two visitors from the Near East stand in white robes, alongside baskets of vegetables that have been temporarily abandoned as the procession passes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view reveals Canaletto’s inventiveness – he has greatly enlarged the square to accommodate the sizeable crowd and removed buildings from one side to give us a clear view of the scene. If we compare the scale of the men in the procession with that of onlookers standing in the two doorways behind, we can see how he has used the relative size of figures to give the painting a greater sense of spatial depth. The spectacular facade of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco, built to house one of Venice’s most important religious and charitable organisations, dominates the background. Canaletto’s brushstrokes mimic the materials that they represent in the Scuola’s stonework, coloured marble inlays and sculpted columns.

An exhibition of paintings by old and contemporary masters was traditionally held outside the Scuola. Here, religious and historical subjects, portraits and view paintings are hung on the facade and on the houses to the left, attracting the attention of passersby.

This impressive structure was rebuilt between 1718 and 1738 by the architect Giovanni Scalfarotto, following the demolition of the former ninth-century church. The church was inaugurated in April 1738 and Canaletto probably painted this view sometime afterwards – though there’s still a workmen’s hut beside the steps. Nearby, women and children gather in front of houses with weathered façades, and several other figures take a look at the new church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Further along, on the same side as San Simeone Piccolo, we see the Ponte della Croce, also known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">ponte della zirada</span> (‘bridge of the turn’) because it is where gondoliers competing in the regatta would turn to race towards the finish. Beyond this, with a plain facade, is the church of Santa Croce. The church of Santa Maria di Nazareth, known as the church of the Scalzi or ‘shoeless’ after the barefoot friars who founded it, appears in the foreground to the right. A small group stands outside the Scalzi, watched by a woman in a yellow shawl and – from the window of a nearby house – two others.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Today our view along the canal is very different. Santa Croce was demolished in 1810, and its site is now occupied by the Papadopoli Gardens.  The buildings beyond the Scalzi, including the church of Santa Lucia shown here with decaying plaster walls, were demolished in 1861 to make way for the railway station. The foreground is now obscured by the Ponte degli Scalzi, built in 1858.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are no surviving drawings of this particular scene by Canaletto, but two studies in the Royal Collection at Windsor depict the same stretch of the canal from different viewpoints. The National Gallery also owns paintings of these views by an unknown follower of Canaletto: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CU9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Upper reaches of the Grand Canal facing Santa Croce</a></span> shows the church of San Simeone Piccolo from the opposite side, while another depicts <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D2P-0001-0000-0000.htm">a frontal view of the church from across the canal</a>.</p></div>

Nearby, women and children gather in front of houses with weathered façades, and several other figures take a look at the new church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Further along, on the same side as San Simeone Piccolo, we see the Ponte della Croce, also known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">ponte della zirada</span> (‘bridge of the turn’) because it is where gondoliers competing in the regatta would turn to race towards the finish. Beyond this, with a plain facade, is the church of Santa Croce. The church of Santa Maria di Nazareth, known as the church of the Scalzi or ‘shoeless’ after the barefoot friars who founded it, appears in the foreground to the right. A small group stands outside the Scalzi, watched by a woman in a yellow shawl and – from the window of a nearby house – two others.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Today our view along the canal is very different. Santa Croce was demolished in 1810, and its site is now occupied by the Papadopoli Gardens.  The buildings beyond the Scalzi, including the church of Santa Lucia shown here with decaying plaster walls, were demolished in 1861 to make way for the railway station. The foreground is now obscured by the Ponte degli Scalzi, built in 1858.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are no surviving drawings of this particular scene by Canaletto, but two studies in the Royal Collection at Windsor depict the same stretch of the canal from different viewpoints. The National Gallery also owns paintings of these views by an unknown follower of Canaletto: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CU9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Upper reaches of the Grand Canal facing Santa Croce</a></span> shows the church of San Simeone Piccolo from the opposite side, while another depicts <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D2P-0001-0000-0000.htm">a frontal view of the church from across the canal</a>.</p></div>

Here, we stand beneath the Procuratie Nuove, which was built between 1580 and 1640 to house the procurators, or caretakers, of San Marco; its ground floor consists of an arcade of 52 stone arches.

Another man, wearing a vivid green cloak and holding a cup and saucer daintily, seems to be listening in on their conversation. Behind him is the famous coffee house, Caffè Florian, a well-known centre of social life during Canaletto’s time (it remains so today). Along the arcade, people sit on benches outside shops and cafes, looking out across the square; the sunlight streams through the archways and shadows stretch across the floor. Nearby, we can see street vendors with baskets of goods, idle dogs and three men wearing long cloaks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A drawing showing just the three men and the dog (British Museum, London) is one of very few studies of people by Canaletto that survive. He used pen to describe the contours of the forms, and the cloak of the standing figure in particular – a detail that can also be seen in this painting. Black outlines shape the breeches worn by the seated figures, while strokes of yellow paint on the sleeves and coats give them a lively texture. Their faces, too, are made up of highlights applied freely to the forehead, cheeks, nose and chin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Canaletto experimented with a form of visual trickery, arranging the vertical lines of particular architectural features – the pillar of the arch and the column on its outer edge with the campanile (bell tower) beyond, for example – to create an unusual and interesting composition. The flag poles in front of the Basilica di San Marco, the city’s grandest church, and the turrets on its facade create more vertical lines, while the steeply angled, diagonal lines of the colonnade draw our eye across rather than up. The figures at the base of the campanile and the far end of the arcade, made up of tiny flicks and dots of paint, help to create an impression of the recession of space.

Here, Guardi has used an archway to guide us into the scene, a device also seen in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVT-0001-0000-0000.htm">An Architectural Caprice</a></span> and Canaletto’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: Piazza San Marco</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Guardi’s paintings of the 1770s were popular with tourists as they evoked the atmosphere of Venice. These ‘picture postcard’ views – Guardi’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">capricci</span> scenes are often no bigger than an A4 piece of paper – were affordable souvenirs and could be easily transported by travellers during their <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Grand Tour</a> of Europe. This is one of 192 paintings given to the National Gallery in 1910 as part of the Salting Bequest. It included other imaginary scenes, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FO7-0001-0000-0000.htm">An Architectural Caprice with a Palladian Style Building</a></span>, as well as views of Venice and its surroundings, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: Piazza San Marco</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIH-0001-0000-0000.htm">View of the Venetian Lagoon with the Tower of Malghera</a></span>.</p></div>

We are drawn into the scene by the large and brightly coloured group of people – among them an elegant couple dressed in black carnival cloaks, a man in a pale yellow cloak with his dog, and traders with baskets of produce. Many figures have their backs to us, though we see the faces of a fashionable gentleman in a red cloak and powdered wig and a man, slightly further back, who walks towards us puffing on a long pipe.

But if you compare Guardi’s paintings with those by Canaletto, it is apparent that his technique is very different. Guardi tended to use a much looser, less precise brushwork, evoking mood instead of meticulous detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is among Guardi’s earliest view paintings. Guardi has created a rhythm across the composition, emphasising the diagonals of the roofs on each side of the square and the faint white lines on the ground, although there are disparities in scale: the foreground figures are not in proportion with the arches of the colonnades and the people emerging from the shops and cafes within them. This rigid symmetry is offset with the strong shadow cast by the building on the right, the Procuratie Nuove, which leads us towards the base of the campanile (bell tower) and also focuses attention on the basilica. The mosaics on its facade shine the brightest as they catch the light while its domes glow silver.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This popular view was repeated many times by Guardi and Canaletto, with slight variations in the composition – see Canaletto’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: Piazza San Marco</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0COI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: Piazza San Marco and the Colonnade of the Procuratie Nuove</a></span>. This picture was actually given to the National Gallery as a work by Canaletto, although Guardi’s signature does appear on a piece of wood being carried by a man at the far right. Around 20 years later Guardi made <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR6-0001-0000-0000.htm">a smaller, more luminous view of the same scene</a>, painted with greater freedom.</p></div>

The background is limited to one wooden wall, but our attention is drawn to different textures: the black lace worn by the woman in the front and the silk dresses of those behind, and the rhino’s rough, dark skin.</p></div>

Many of the spectators have masked faces to conceal their identity and social status, as was customary during the Carnival. Longhi has captured a glimpse of the city’s amusements during the festival, which often included exotic animals such as lions and elephants, but this is actually a rather sombre scene: Miss Clara stands in a simple enclosure, languidly munching on hay. The background is limited to one wooden wall and raised seating. Our attention is drawn to different textures, like the black lace worn by the doll-like woman in the front row and the silk dresses of those further back, as well as the rhino’s rough, dark skin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Longhi painted an earlier version of this scene, now in the Ca' Rezzonico in Venice, for the Venetian nobleman Giovanni Grimaldi.

In the background is the city of Jerusalem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This episode isn‘t actually described in the Bible, but there was a long tradition of illustrating it.

Here we see the two thieves who were crucified alongside Christ, as well as ladders propped against the Cross, elements which usually appear in pictures of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EF5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Deposition</a>. On the right is the ’good thief‘, who recognised Christ as the son of God and was saved; the ’bad thief', who was damned, has his back to us. Their bodies are not nailed to their crosses, but tied backwards over the cross bar: this may be closer to reality. The two turbaned men on the right may be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EC7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nicodemus</a>, who anointed and buried Christ’s body (John 19: 39).

They are potent and moving symbols, but their placing also creates depth and their outlines give subtle movement against the background. In both the crucified bodies and the main foreground figures, Domenico focused on body language rather than facial expressions – the Virgin being the exception – as a way of provoking feelings of pity and sadness in the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Domenico was much influenced by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>.
