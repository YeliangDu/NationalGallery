He created them for his own pleasure after a lack of commercial success led him to give up trying to make a living as a professional artist in the 1860s. The fact that he was not aiming to sell them gave him the freedom to experiment with new techniques and radically simplified compositions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this abstracted seascape the mighty power of nature is condensed in miniature, with a palette restricted to shades of black and white. Sea and sky are conveyed with deft sweeps of the brush while the boats and seagulls are touched in with strokes of calligraphic delicacy. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> is applied thinly, with the white <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> left to show through in places to suggest the gleam of light above the horizon and breaking waves. The ocean threatens to engulf the two boats, and the black irregular shapes in the right foreground resembling rocks are dark omens of possible shipwreck. There is no landmark to indicate a specific place, but the scene was inspired by the turbulent seas off the coast of north Norway.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Balke began painting the Norwegian landscape in the decades after his country had signed a constitution in 1814, separating it from Denmark and giving it a degree of independence. A growing sense of national pride led artists to turn their attention to their country’s dramatic scenery. Balke himself made journeys on foot through large swathes of the countryside but it was not until 1832 that he ventured to the far north. The region was widely imagined as a fascinating mythical place that was alien and scary, but it was relatively inaccessible and few outsiders had actually been there. Balke was one of the first painters to make the voyage by sea, travelling up the coast as far as the North Cape, Europe’s most northerly point.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On this epic coastal journey he experienced a tempest like the one shown here. Once safely on land in the aftermath of the hurricane he confided to his diary: ‘I had positioned myself on a rocky plateau some 100 feet above the sea, and I felt I had to hold on tight to the cliff when the backwash hurled itself against the rock face and with a deafening sound like thunder rolled out again into the heaving sea…’ It was, he said, a magnificent sight that would never fade from his memory, and the breathtaking Arctic landscape battered by turbulent weather provided him with material for paintings for the rest of his life. Storms at sea, shipwrecks, mountains, towering cliffs and lighthouses offering warnings to sailors became an established part of his repertoire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Balke’s earlier landscapes have an affinity with those of his fellow Norwegian, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QGW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Johan Christian Dahl</a>, with whom he studied 1836 and 1843–4 and who encouraged him to concentrate on nature. Balke’s paintings also recall those of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PK3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caspar David Friedrich</a>, whom he met in Dresden. Like Friedrich, Balke stressed the ‘sublime’ awe-inspiring aspects of the natural world. But unlike Friedrich, Balke did not depict its features in minute detail, preferring to convey them in a freer, more painterly style. The idiosyncratic private landscapes of his later years have an expressiveness that is unlike anyone else’s. Looked at today they seem almost modern.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The evening sun touches the sturdy cattle standing at the foot of the ruins of a Roman archway. The soft light casts shadows on the weather-worn stones, displaying the ruin’s age and former grandeur. Weeds and trailing plants hang from its crumbling stones. The acute angle of the perspective with which the archway is painted makes it tower above the cattle and the people, seeming to rival the distant mountain for its command over the landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The hills behind may have been seen and recorded by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5U-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolaes Berchem</a> during a possible stay in Italy, but the cows are unmistakably Dutch cows – solid, well-nurtured, productive and highly valued for their vital place in the Dutch economy. Berchem places them in a fan shape, a neat way of presenting us with different views of the animals, revealing his skill in painting their sturdy bodies, their deep, resonant colours and characterful faces.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The peasants, like the scenery, appear more Italian than Dutch. The bare-legged young man, up to his ankles in the stream, heaves a heavy load with his dog beside him, keeping an eye on the cows. He, like the second man in the painting, wears a big shady hat that seems suited to the hot Italian – rather than the weaker Northern – sun. The second man, swathed in a heavy cloak, seems a close relative of the Neapolitan brigands in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salvator Rosa</a>’s paintings. One looks up at the mounted young woman perched high up on her laden donkey; her gesture in response to his gaze is open to interpretation, but her elevated position and fresh, clean garments seem to give her a status superior to his.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Berchem paints the light catching her high forehead, the sleeves of her costume and a cloth on the donkey’s back where she rests a dainty, bare foot. It gives the deep blue of her bodice a rich sheen, but it’s the bright red of her billowing skirt – the one touch of red in the picture – that lifts and enlivens the scene; many years later, the English artists <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Turner</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P58-0001-0000-0000.htm">Constable</a> understood and often used this effect.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Berchem’s work, like that of other Italianate painters – so-called because they had lived in Italy and been influenced by the work of Italian artists, the southern landscape and the remnants of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Antiquity</a> – was highly prized by collectors especially in France but also in Britain, throughout the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. His paintings could fetch a huge amount until well into the nineteenth century. In the latter half of that century they began to be seen as ‘un-Dutch’ and therefore less interesting. The picture became part of Sir Robert Peel’s large collection of Dutch and Flemish paintings. When the collection was bought for the nation in 1871, the taste for such paintings was perhaps already seen as rather old-fashioned.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jean Joseph Xavier Bidauld was a member of the early generation of neo-classical landscapists. He was taught by Claude-Joseph Vernet, who had introduced oil sketching to the influential artist and teacher Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes. Bidauld was in Italy from 1785 to 1790, where he produced studies which are characteristically detailed and highly finished. This view, probably completed in the studio, is no exception.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tivoli, lying to the north-east of Rome and famous for its waterfalls, was a favourite destination for painters. In Bidauld’s study the whole of the left side is in deep shadow, the soft brushstrokes in dark greens, conveying a sense of damp mossy vegetation. On the right, in full sun, the foliage is meticulously delineated and the fall of sunlight on the leaves at the right and at the top is captured in minute touches of paint. The thunderous descent of the water is conveyed with fluid strokes of white.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Bonington made this around 1825-7 at La Ferté, on the estuary of the river Somme in northern France. He probably painted it on location using a wet-in-wet technique – painting directly onto wet paint rather than building up layers or glazes over time – that enabled him to recreate the spontaneity of watercolour in oils. Broad horizontal brushstrokes evoke an expansive blue sky. Vertical strokes create a bank of clouds and a suggestion of rain in the distance. Some details, such as the seated woman on the right, may have been added later in the studio.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bonington’s parents were English but he spent much of his life in France, travelling extensively in Normandy and Picardy. The freshness and immediacy of his painting was particularly admired by French artists, such as Eugène Delacroix, and later by the Impressionists. One of the most promising artists of his generation, he died aged only 25 in 1828.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0U-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bonington</a> probably painted this around 1825-7 at La Ferté, on the estuary of the river Somme in northern France. His parents were English, but the family emigrated to France in 1817, when he was 15. Having enrolled in the Paris studio of the history painter Baron Gros, he abandoned academic training for landscape painting, travelling extensively in northern France, particularly in Normandy and Picardy. La Ferté and nearby St Valèry-sur-Somme were among his favourite haunts, which he frequently visited with his painting companions, who included <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QFG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Huet</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Turner</a>, Bonington’s early experience as a watercolourist profoundly influenced his approach to oil painting. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Ferté</span>, which was painted outdoors on site, Bonington uses swift, fluid stokes of thinly applied oil paint, which in places barely covers the surface of the board, to create an immediacy usually achieved with watercolour. This is enhanced by his painting directly onto wet paint, rather than gradually building up layers or glazes over time. Look closely and you can see this in the mound’s edge, just to the left under the seated figure, and in the distant land on the horizon. Bonington makes no attempt to hide the track of the brush’s bristles through the paint. Not only are brush marks clearly visible – for example, in the long, horizontal strokes of the river bank and the short, vertical strokes of the clouds on the left – but the mix of long sweeps and shorter cross-hatching further adds to the liveliness of the picture. Having laid down broad areas of colour (limited to gradations of white, blue and a greyish ochre), Bonington creates detail and atmospheric distance by mainly using white, black and red paint, which he applies in thin liquid streaks (for the breaking waves) or with small blobs or drops (in the seated figure). These details, including the beached boat created out of a flurry of scribbled brushstrokes, may have been added later in the studio.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bonington’s method of painting directly outdoors and of recreating the freshness and immediacy of a watercolour sketch in an oil painting had a great impact upon French artists in the 1820s. During the Napoleonic wars, travel and cultural exchange between Britain and France had ground to a halt, but with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TO5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Napoleon</a>’s defeat in 1815 it resumed. The 1820s, especially, saw intense French interest in British culture, and British artists, including Bonington and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P58-0001-0000-0000.htm">Constable</a>, showed their work at the Paris <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> throughout the decade. Many French artists admired the technical freedom and expressiveness of the British painters. As the critic Théophile Gautier noted, ‘With regard to colour, the revolution in painting proceeded from Bonington’. Bonington’s work had a direct effect upon <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eugène Delacroix</a>, who befriended him when they met in Paris. Delacroix observed: ‘One can find in other modern masters qualities of strength and precision superior to those in Bonington’s pictures, but no one in this modern school, and possibly even before, has possessed that lightness of touch which, particularly in the watercolours, makes his work a type of diamond that flatters and ravishes the eye, independently of any subject matter and any imitation.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A solitary tall pine tree rises from a steep mountain slope overlooking a deep valley. Many of its branches have been broken away or are damaged, leaving only the uppermost ones with foliage. A river flows in the valley below, its journey broken by waterfalls as it descends from the mountains. Small huts and fir trees can be seen on the grassy slopes of the valley bottom, which is flanked on either side by rocky cliffs. There is no mid-ground or middle distance; instead, we experience an abrupt shift in scale as our eyes switch from the tree, which is relatively close to us, to the distant valley and mountains. Although very small, the picture creates an effect of immense space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The view is of Handeck, a hamlet in the Haslital valley in the Bernese Alps. The river below is the Aare, which flows north-west through the valley, forming the Handeck Falls, for which the area is well known. In this painting, we are looking south to south-west towards the Aare glaciers in the far distance with the Handeck Falls visible in the narrow pass just below them. The dark mountain on the left is most likely the Gerstenhörner, which lies to the east of the Grimsel Pass.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Swiss artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PLY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alexandre Calame</a> was a frequent visitor to the Bernese Alps. His first visit was in the summer of 1835 and he returned often until the 1860s. The untamed, rugged beauty of Handeck especially appealed to him, and he painted numerous views of it, all facing south, including a number of pictures focusing on the waterfall itself. In this painting, however, it is the tree which dominates the scene with the Falls as a backdrop. Calame produced many studies of trees and often made single trees the principal feature in his Swiss scenes from the 1850s, paying meticulous attention to the distinctiveness of each type of foliage. Calame painted this tree’s needles with great precision using dark green, which he then overlayed with a lighter green for the branches closest to us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Calame was interested in more than just accuracy, as trees also have a symbolic meaning for him – a belief he shared with German artist  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PK3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caspar David Friedrich</a>  and which is of central importance in Friedrich’s  <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E7N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Winter Landscape</a></span>. Although damaged by the forces of nature – such as the darkening storm that appears to be gathering overhead – this pine tree might be seen as a symbol of strength, and such human qualities as endurance in the face of adversity. For Calame, these anthropomorphic qualities also had religious overtones, as he viewed his work as ‘homage ... to the Author of all beauty and truth’. He commented that ‘[The fir tree] before being uprooted rules over vast solitudes alone with God’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Calame’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> vision of landscape – whether it be the idealised landscape of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Lake of Thun</span> or dramatic vistas such as this – God’s presence is everywhere. The solitary tree is a token of that presence, but perhaps also stands in for the lone traveller – and us – contemplating God’s work.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting combines an accurate view of Rome, on the left, with an imaginary ruin, on the right. The distant view is of the sixteenth-century church of Santa Trinità de' Monti, recognisable by its two clock towers. This is where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> would be buried. Beside this is the convent of the Sacro Cuore. These buildings are now at the top of the Spanish Steps, which were built during the eighteenth century. Further to the right is the Palazzo Zuccari and on the horizon in the centre is the Quirinal Palace, the Pope’s summer residence. The viewpoint may be from the top of Claude’s house in Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the right is an entrance to a temple and a statue of Apollo, god of music, holding a lyre. The young man in the foreground may be giving alms in the form of coins to the peasant woman as a religious act of virtue. Or he could be paying for sex with the two young girls behind her, one of whom kneels with her hands crossed while the other reaches out to embrace a male companion. If this is a scene of prostitution, placing it in the shadow of a ruined pagan temple may have been intended as a deliberate symbolic contrast with the church bathed in sunlight on the opposite side of the picture. These kinds of figures do not appear in other works by Claude, and some commentators in the past have suggested that they may have been painted by another artist. However, the painted-out changes, or pentimenti, made to the position of the figures and background details suggest this was the work of one artist – most likely Claude.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Signed and dated 1632, this is one of Claude’s early works. The buildings are depicted in a sketchy style and without an understanding of how to combine intricate detail and perspective. The contrast between light and shade in the composition lacks subtlety: the background is shown in blazing sunlight whereas the foreground is almost in darkness. During this period, Claude was developing his own style and was influenced by other artists, such as Willem van Nieulandt II (1584–1635) who combines the real and imaginary in his landscapes; <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Agostino Tassi</a> (1578–1644), known for his warm colouring, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PST-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cornelis van Poelenburgh</a> (1594–1667) for his light effects.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view is of Bowleaze Cove in Dorset  looking west from Osmington. The Jordon stream trickles over the sand, with Furzy Cliff and Jordon Hill beyond. Thick clouds scud across the bright winter sky above the Downs as they slope to the sandy cove and sea. Constable suggests the waves rolling in to the beach with thick streaks of grey and white paint, which mirror the colour of the clouds. The pinkish-buff <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> has been left to show through the thinly painted foreground and, in places, through the paint of the sky, to express the colour of the Dorset sand and give weight to the clouds. This technique gives the picture a spontaneous, sketchy appearance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Constable became familiar with this area of the Dorset coast during the six weeks of his honeymoon from mid-October to December 1816. Aged 40, he married Maria Elizabeth Bicknell, who like him was from East Bergholt in Suffolk. Constable’s friend, the Reverend John Fisher, married the couple in London at the church of St Martin-in-the-Fields and invited them to stay at his vicarage in Osmington, a small village near Weymouth. Fisher wrote to Constable: ‘My house commands a singularly beautiful view: &amp; you may study from my very windows.’ He described the countryside there as ‘wonderfully wild and sublime and well worth a painter’s visit’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Constable made many oil sketches and 20 or so drawings and watercolours of the smaller coves within the wide span of Weymouth Bay and other views nearby. From Osmington, short paths led down to the beach and to the fishing village of Osmington Mills, and up to the panoramic views of the sea from the downs. The only figures in Constable’s views of the bay are fishermen, a few people walking on the sands and an occasional shepherd on the Downs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery’s painting is one of three oil versions of this view by Constable. The first version may be the small oil sketch with a stormy sky, now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London, which was almost certainly painted outdoors from nature. The very rapidly painted little millboard oil sketch would have fitted into the lid of Constable’s outdoor painting box. He used to rest the painting box on his knee and use the lid as an easel. The National Gallery’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> is twice the size of the millboard sketch and may have been painted back at the vicarage, about half a mile from the beach.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The distant plume of smoke or water in the stormy scene has been transformed in the National Gallery’s painting into a shepherd with his flock of sheep. The third, larger and more highly finished painting (Louvre, Paris) is the final version Constable painted of this view and is developed from both the others. In the Louvre picture, the sky is stormy and there are a few more figures than in the National Gallery’s painting. It was probably the Louvre version that Constable exhibited at the British Institution in 1819 as ‘Osmington Shore, near Weymouth.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David Lucas made a mezzotint <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIC-0008-0000-0000.htm">engraving</a> of the scene titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Weymouth Bay, Dorsetshire</span>, mainly from the Louvre version, for Constable’s book <span class="dokuwiki_italic">English Landscape Scenery</span> of 1830. Constable suggested the alternative titles of ‘Tempestuous Afternoon’ or ‘Tempestuous Evening’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was purchased after Constable’s death by George Salting (1835–1909) and entered the National Gallery in 1910 as part of the Salting Bequest.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Corot painted this small oil sketch on paper in the spring of 1826, a few months after beginning his first of three trips to Italy. He painted a number of views that included the Aqua Claudia, a Roman aqueduct, which you can see in the distance, around five kilometres south-east of Rome.

Despite the picture’s very small size, he has created an effect of expansive space with very economical means, as areas of colour, laid down with thin paint, are given definition and scale by details such as the trees and architecture.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As was the custom for many French artists in the early nineteenth century, Corot travelled to Italy as part of his training. He arrived there in late 1825 to begin his first (and longest) visit, which lasted three years. His former teachers, Achille-Etna Michallon and Victor Bertin, had both been specialists in classical landscape and had worked in Rome and the surrounding countryside, where they sketched the ruins and classical sculptures they included in their paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Accompanied by a fellow student from Bertin’s studio, Johan Karl Baehr, Corot arrived in Rome in November 1825. He spent much of the following year in the countryside around Rome, returning to the city for the winter, when he worked on finished pictures for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a>. Except for a visit to Naples in February 1828, he remained close to Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Corot painted a number of views that included the Aqua Claudia, which you can see in the distance. One of two aqueducts begun by Gaius Caesar in AD 38 and completed by Claudius in AD 52, the Aqua Claudia was supplied with water from the Caerulean and Curtian springs. When Corot painted this view, the aqueduct’s ruins could be seen just five kilometres south-east of Rome on the Via Appia Nuova. The precise spot where he stood to paint this picture has been identified: near the church of Sant’ Urbano around three kilometres from the Porta San Sebastiano. The square tower almost in the centre of the picture is the Tor Fiscale, a medieval defence tower. On either side of the tower is the Acqua Felice, an aqueduct built by Pope Sixtus in 1585. The Alban Hills can be seen on the right, and the Monti Prenestini on the left. The River Almone flows in the mid-distance, behind the trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small picture is an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> sketch on paper, which was laid down on canvas at a later date. It is likely that Corot painted it in the spring of 1826, a few months after the start of his stay in Italy. There are traces of some basic drawing (possibly with crayon), mainly of the architecture and along the tops of the hills, but none in the foreground. Corot used a limited range of colours – tones of green, beige and violet-blue for the land, and blue, grey, purple and white for the sky – to create an open sunlit landscape beneath a blue sky filled with bright cumulus clouds. Despite the picture’s very small size, he has created an effect of expansive space with very economical means: areas of colour, laid down with thin paint, are given definition and scale by details such as the trees and architecture. These details also allowed Corot to introduce tonal accents and highlights (for example, the pink strip of the aqueduct placed against the violet-blues of the mountains) that complement the golden-browns and greens that predominate in the landscape. Alternating bands of lighter and darker tones running across the picture further enhance its sense of depth.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted around 1800, this small oil sketch on canvas by the Belgian artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Simon Denis</a> is a fine example of the type of study produced by artists working in Italy from about 1780 to 1850, who painted swiftly and directly from nature. Corot’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D5U-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Roman Campagna, with the Claudian Aqueduct</a></span>, painted in the same region some 25 years later, is another excellent example. Most of these studies were unsigned and undated, but an inscription on the back of this picture confirms it is by Denis, who was in Rome from 1786 to about 1803.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Soon after Denis arrived in Rome, having previously studied in Paris, his work began to attract attention. Although his finished landscapes tended to be exercises in finely detailed late eighteenth-century <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">classicism</a>, he was also well-known for his outdoor sketching. The relative freedom of these oil studies is very different from his more formal landscapes and Denis was particularly praised for his ability to capture fleeting atmospheric effects. While in Paris, he may have met the painter and writer Pierre-Henri de Valenciennes, who had recently returned from Rome where he had been working for four years. Valenciennes’s treatise on painting outdoors, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Éléments de perspective pratique</span> (published in 1800), was to influence many artists, including Corot. It would seem that Denis, in his studies of Roman rooftops, rocks and skies, was also following Valenciennes’s advice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Denis’s oil studies are often of dramatic scenes from nature, particularly the spectacle of the sun setting behind stormy clouds, which allowed him to show various intense light effects. In this sketch, a thin strip of grey-green land at the bottom of the picture, which is otherwise filled by the expansive sky, anchors the composition and gives it scale – a device also used by Valenciennes. In the distance, some dark grey-brown buildings, possibly ruins, are silhouetted against the horizon. Their function, perhaps, is also to give a sense of scale and provide a focal point to the setting sun, which is hidden by a purple-grey cloud. Although the sun itself cannot be seen directly, shafts of pale yellow and pink sunlight radiate from behind the cloud.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The entire sketch has been rapidly painted – most likely in under an hour – and Denis adjusts the handling of the paint according to the area he is working on The paint itself ranges from just a thin coating – for example  the initial <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> colour which you can still see in places – to the thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a> cream and yellow paint used to highlight the upper edges of the clouds in the picture’s centre, which evoke the brilliance of the sunlight behind them. The grey clouds have a textured appearance, as if the paint has been stippled on, using the end of the brush, rather than brushed on smoothly. The sky and the sun’s rays, however, are painted with long fluid strokes. These shafts of sunlight vary from quite thickly painted strokes of yellow and pink to more delicate strokes used for the vertical rays directly above the cloud. To the right, Denis has painted a broad ray, which cuts diagonally across the grey clouds, using just a single unbroken upward stroke of a wide brush.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the most well-known views of classical Rome. We are looking along the Forum towards the Palazzo Senatorio on the Capitol. Although the Forum had yet to be fully excavated, the three surviving columns of the Temple of Castor and Pollux can be seen here on the left. The remains of the Temples of Saturn and Vespasian are in the middle distance, and the Arch of Septimius Severus is on the right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Danish artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg</a> painted this picture during the three years he spent in Italy from 1813 to 1816, when he produced around 40 views of Rome and its surroundings as well as figure compositions and portraits. Although modest in scale, these views are among his finest achievements. Writing to the engraver J.F. Clemens in July 1814, Eckersberg announced his plan to 'make a collection of the most beautiful views in and around Rome … I have completed about ten small studies which are all painted on the spot direct from nature’. This painting corresponds with a detailed drawing (Hirschsprung Collection, Copenhagen), dated 8 June 1814. This drawing would have given him a very precise guide when painting, although it is likely that some of the picture was painted at the Forum itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Illuminated by the bright sunlight – the short shadows indicate it is around midday – the warm pinks, orange-browns and yellow ochre of the buildings almost glow against a clear blue sky. Eckersberg painted the architecture, particularly the ruins, in meticulous detail. The picture is structured around a scaffolding of interlocking horizontals and verticals, which form a near abstract grid that binds the composition together. In his later years, when a professor at the Royal Academy in Copenhagen, Eckersberg became particularly interested in the theory of perspective and published his own rules about spatial construction and the effects of light and shade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Eckersberg’s use of architectural features to define space perhaps also shows the influence of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">neoclassical</a> painter Jacques-Louis David, whose studio Eckersberg frequented when in Paris from 1810 to 1813 and who had encouraged him to visit Italy. In his views of Rome, Eckersberg combines neoclassical severity with a new realism based upon observation, which was to characterise his mature style. Yet this is more than just a topographical study. Eckersberg gives equal attention to everyday activities, including transporting goods by cart, watering a horse at the fountain and herding mules. This creating a poignant contrast between the quiet routine of contemporary agrarian life and the urban grandeur of what had once been Imperial Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Landscape painters working in and around Rome from around 1780 to 1830 often painted on location, anticipating the practice of painting outdoors that became a significant aspect of later nineteenth-century art.

A man, having cast aside his crutches, lies against a large boulder in a snowy landscape as he prays in front of a shining crucifix protected by three fir trees – a trinity that recalls the Christian Trinity of God the Father, Christ and the Holy Ghost. The silhouette of a German Gothic cathedral or church looms in the mist, its facade and spires echoing the shapes of the trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture appears to be a companion to another painting, of the same date and title, in the Staatliches Museum, Schwerin. In the Schwerin picture, a similar tiny figure, leaning on a crutch, stares at a deserted snow-covered landscape under a grey-black sky as he wanders among dead or dying oak trees. If that picture is one of desolation and despair, the National Gallery painting offers the hope of resurrection through Christian faith.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was the first painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PK3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Friedrich</a>, one of the principal figures of German <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4M-0008-0000-0000.htm">Romantic</a> art, to enter a British public collection when purchased by the National Gallery in 1987. It had been discovered in Paris in 1982 in the collection of an exiled Russian prince. It shows a snowy landscape in which a man, having cast aside his crutches, lies against a large boulder as he prays in front of a shining crucifix protected by three fir trees (a trinity that recalls the Christian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Trinity</a>). In the distance, the silhouette of a German <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4S-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gothic</a> cathedral looms in the mist, its facade and spires echoing the shapes of the trees in the foreground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture most likely dates from 1811 and appears to be a pendant (companion) to another painting, of the same date and title, in the Staatliches Museum, Schwerin. In the Schwerin picture, a similar tiny figure, leaning on a crutch, stares at a deserted snow-covered landscape under a grey-black sky. As he wanders among dead or dying oak trees, the stumps of felled trees stretch into the distance behind him. If that picture is one of desolation and despair, the National Gallery painting offers the hope of resurrection through Christian faith. The shoots of grass pushing through the snow, evergreen trees and faint pink glow of approaching dawn affirm its message of renewal and rebirth. It is a fine example of Friedrich’s use of landscape painting as a vehicle for religious feeling and personal symbolism. As he stated, his aim was not ‘the faithful representation of air, water, rocks and trees … but the reflection of [the artist’s] soul and emotion in these objects.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Winter Landscape</span> is painted with a limited range of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a>, its atmospheric effect achieved through smoothly graduated tones rather than colour. The distinctive effect of a shimmering translucent mist was achieved by careful stippling with the point of a brush using smalt, a blue pigment that contains glass and is transparent in an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> medium. Friedrich’s precise handling of paint derives from his training as a draughtsman and topographical artist. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared</a> photography shows detailed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> in most areas of the picture. The structure of the cathedral, especially, was defined in detail, possibly in pencil overlaid with ink. Friedrich included similar visionary Gothic cathedrals in other paintings. These were usually imaginary structures, although often based upon his studies of actual buildings, notably the Marienkirche in Neubrandenburg.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A very similar version of this picture was discovered in 1940 and is now in the Museum für Kunst und Kulturgeschichte in Dortmund. Although several other pictures by Friedrich exist in at least one other version, there is reference to only one <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Winter Landscape</span> in the early literature on him. Until the discovery of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Winter Landscape</span> in Paris, the Dortmund picture was believed to be the original painted by Friedrich in 1811. However, there is no evidence of underdrawing in the Dortmund version, the overall execution is less detailed, the gateway beneath the cathedral is missing (as are the blades of grass in the foreground) and the cathedral itself is a vague silhouette that lacks any distinct architectural features. The Dortmund picture may be a replica by Friedrich but is more likely a copy by a pupil or imitator. The London <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Winter Landscape</span>, however, has all the hallmarks of Friedrich’s own hand.</p></div>

This striking composition, dominated by the geometrical precision of the zinc roof in the foreground, is typical of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P95-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gaertner</a>’s work.

He moved his business to these premises in 1833, and it is possible that the picture was painted shortly afterwards. Although the style is similar to Gaertner’s work of the 1830s, Ravené was mainly active as a collector after 1845, so the picture could have been painted later. The relatively small scale of the work and the lack of signature suggest that it may be a study for a larger painting but no other picture of this view by Gaertner has survived.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gaertner began his career with an apprenticeship at the Royal Porcelain Factory in Berlin and later took drawing classes at the Academy of Arts. In 1821, he started work in the studio of Carl Wilhelm Gropius, the court theatre painter, where he became increasingly attracted to architectural painting. After a trip to Paris, he developed his skills in the manipulation of light and atmosphere, and was inspired to devote himself almost entirely to painting architectural views.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On his return to Berlin, he started painting views of the buildings of the city, such as this one, and also produced a series of scenes depicting the castles in Bellevue, Charlottenburg and Glienicke, mainly for royal customers. In 1833, he was admitted to the Academy and designated a ‘Perspective Painter’. The following year, he began his most famous work: a six-panel panorama of Berlin that was purchased by the King of Prussia – a second version was bought by the King’s daughter, Tsarina Alexandra Feodorovna, leading to a trip to Russia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, when King Friedrich Wilhelm III died in 1840, his successor, Friedrich Wilhelm IV, who preferred Italian-style paintings, bought very little from Gaertner. As the century progressed he was also under direct competition from the new medium of photography. It is believed that he made use of a camera obscura to sketch the layouts of his paintings. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infra-red photography</a> has revealed an extremely precise pencil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> for this particular painting with the entire composition mapped out in great detail. Gaertner also possessed a collection of photographs, but there is no evidence that he used these as models.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Originally from Aix-en-Provence, François-Marius Granet studied with both Jean-Antoine Constantin and Jacques-Louis David. In 1802 he travelled to Rome with Comte Auguste de Forbin (1777 -1841) (later curator of the Louvre) for a brief visit; he returned soon after for a stay of 21 years, only returning to France in 1824. While in Rome he was taught by Simon Denis. Granet was particularly drawn to the textures, colours and forms of the city’s architecture, and indeed earned money selling drawings of ancient monuments.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here he has depicted a tightly packed cluster of houses, roofs and arches. Using dilute paint with a degree of transparency, he has created a homogenous surface of warm browns and greys, punctuated with darker windows and doors. The expressive brushstrokes in the thin paint lend a sense of wear and decay to the buildings. By contrast, the luminous sky is painted smoothly.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Thomas Jones’s twelve or so small oil sketches on paper painted in Naples during 1782 have become the best known of all the work that he produced during his seven-year stay in Italy. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Wall in Naples</span> is one of five studies of buildings from high viewpoints, which are considered to be the most remarkable and original work of his career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of Jones’s time in Italy was spent either in the studio, painting commissioned views in oil on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvases</a> of conventional size, or gathering material in sketchbooks, to be worked up, sometimes years later, in watercolour. Few of his works on paper were highly finished and they were not, unlike his larger canvas paintings, the types of idealised ‘views of Italy’ bought by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Grand Tourists</a> to be taken back to England.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By the spring of 1782, Jones knew he was facing his last year in Italy. In 1779, he had set up house with Maria Moncke in Naples, where she bore him two daughters, and although they lived frugally, money was running out. Looking out from various windows or flat roofs, catching oblique views of warehouses, tenements and churches, Jones seems suddenly to have sensed the individuality of the buildings of Naples, and was determined to record it. When Jones and his family moved to the Vicolo del Canale, on the hill going up to Capodimonte, he enjoyed exclusive use of the roof terrace, and it was probably here that he painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Wall in Naples</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of Jones’s Naples oils on paper are dated 1782 on the back, some are inscribed with the month as well as the year and a few have titles. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Wall in Naples</span> has neither so it is difficult to place it in the sequence. All the rooftop views are of different sizes and it is possible that Jones cropped some to intensify their impact. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Wall in Naples</span> is the smallest of them, not much larger than a postcard. The shuttered windows, the irregular pattern of scaffolding holes, the patchy cement and the habitual water stain from chamber pots thrown out of the window are not features that can help us to identify the building, but they are the freshly observed details of a particular wall, although Jones may have adjusted some of them to enhance his composition. The sketch is painted from a close viewpoint, probably across the narrow street from Jones’s roof terrace. The rectangle of sky is intensely blue suggesting that it was a very hot day in mid-summer, perhaps the same time as Jones painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Houses in Naples</span> (British Museum, London), which is inscribed August 1782.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of Jones’s time was taken up with painting commissioned pictures, many of them large classicising landscape views. There is a huge difference between Jones’s ’studies‘ and his ’Pictures'. For example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lake Albano</span> (Yale Center for British Art, New Haven USA) is almost six-foot wide and took 41 days to paint. Working in oil on paper on a small scale and directly recording what he alone viewed as a subject, Jones achieves an originality not hinted at in his larger canvases.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Located just outside Copenhagen, the Citadel (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Kastellet</span>) was a former military fort surrounded by moats and ramparts. Last used during the British bombardment of Copenhagen in 1807, it still housed around 600 soldiers and their families. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christen Købke</a> and his parents lived there from 1819 to 1833. Købke’s father was the Citadel’s master baker, and the family moved out when he retired. Købke often returned to the Citadel over the next four years. He painted several views of it including this one, which he may have given to his mother as a souvenir of their former home.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this picture, Købke has painted a drawbridge outside the Citadel’s north gate. From a vantage point at the foot of the rampart beside the bridge, he is looking across the moat looking towards a guardhouse on the other side. Although the drawbridge no longer exits, Købke’s preliminary sketches and oil study allow us to follow the choices he made in selecting this particular point of view. In an initial sketch (National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen) he placed himself to the left of the bridge. However, realising perhaps that the bridge seen from this location would block the view, he reversed the composition in a later, highly detailed drawing (Vejle Art Museum, Denmark) and an oil sketch (National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen). The oil sketch would have been painted outdoors, on site, most likely in May 1837.  The revised vantage point, to the right of bridge and slightly further from it, allows the bridge to lead our eye into the picture and gives a clear view of the guardhouse.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Købke worked on the final painting in his studio at home, signing and dating it in September 1837. In contrast to the spontaneity of the oil sketch, he returned to the detailed precision of the compositional drawing. The intricacy and complexity of the manmade structure recalls the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg</a>, his teacher at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen – for example, Eckersberg’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EF9-0001-0000-0000.htm">View of the Forum in Rome</a></span>. Bathed in an evening light, rather than the bright daylight of the oil sketch, and with a hint of pink in the sky, Købke’s view is suffused with tones of the complementary colours red and green. Other changes included adding two soldiers fishing in the canal and replacing a soldier on the bridge with a sailor with his back turned towards us, who gazes at the scene before him, as we do. Købke also enhanced the effect of depth by placing a small group of figures at the far end of the bridge and by adding a thick band of rushes along the picture’s lower edge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One viewer, the theologian W.F. Wiborg, pointed out that the withered rushes indicated autumn although the new leaves on the trees suggested spring. Wiborg also claimed it was impossible to identify the exact type of poplar tree and that, ‘the sky has an evening light, while the earth has midday light'. Although such demands for accuracy were typical of art criticism at that time, Købke was perhaps more interested in creating a specific mood – one infused with a fond nostalgia for the place where he grew up.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small oil sketch of Oetzthal in the Austrian Alps was painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T6V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vilhelm Petersen</a> when he was travelling to Italy in the summer of 1850. A landscape painter who was part of the last generation of artists of the so-called Danish Golden Age, he studied under <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christoffer Wilhelm Eckersberg</a> and Johan Ludvig Lund at the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in Copenhagen. In 1848 he received a scholarship from the Academy to travel to Italy, but he had to postpone his journey for two years because of political unrest in Europe. When he was eventually able to leave Denmark, he travelled to Italy via the Netherlands, Germany and the Austrian Tyrol. He remained in Italy until 1852, producing some of his most notable paintings there.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Oetzthal valley, south-east of Innsbruck and north of Trento, is around 40 miles long. Formed by the main chain of the Alps, it separates the Stubai Alps in the east from the Oetzthal Alps in the west and is bordered by some of Austria’s highest mountains. The southern end of the valley meets the Italian border, and in this painting we are most likely looking south towards Italy, perhaps from a vantage point near the town of Oetz.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Petersen was a prolific sketcher, both in Denmark, where he was particularly drawn to coastal towns, and on his travels through Europe. This sketch, painted on paper and subsequently mounted on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>, was almost certainly made quite quickly on the spot, possibly with a view to producing a more finished painting at a later date. In the foreground, you can see where Petersen has swiftly indicated the outlines of the nearest mountains with pencil and washes of underpaint and has used zigzag lines for the fir trees. He has also noted the location and date. This lack of finish, particularly in the foreground, and the visible use of pencil were typical of the traditional technique for oil sketching, as artists sought to capture the principal forms and tones of a scene but without completing the painting. In this sketch, Petersen’s attention is mainly focused on the mountains in the background, and on the play of light and atmospheric effects of the clouds. An almost clear blue sky, which slightly lightens near the horizon, forms a backdrop to the mountain peaks, with just a line of low cloud on the right. Using subtle tones of lavender and a pale blue-grey for the far mountains, he created an effect of distance and summer haze. As it is summer, there is only a little snow, which he painted with thin streaks of brilliant white.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Petersen’s paintings have the clarity and technical skill of his teacher, Eckersberg, but also show the influence of French painting, particularly the naturalism and direct observation of Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F7X-0008-0000-0000.htm">Barbizon</a> artists, who often painted outdoors. The emphasis in this sketch on the mid and far distance over the foreground was also a feature of many of Corot’s sketches and studio paintings.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view almost certainly dates from Charles Rémond’s 1822–5 period in Italy. A landscape unfolds under a clear bright sky; a valley runs between overlapping hills, pale blue hills form a backdrop. Despite the luminous sky the colours are muted, the passage from foreground to misty distance carefully orchestrated.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The long flowing brushwork is barely visible in places, with passages of more expressive, yet still controlled work in the foreground. The bushes and grasses are rendered minutely, with small, individual strokes for every leaf or blade of grass. It has been suggested that the tightly constructed composition, coupled with the canvas support, could indicate a studio work rather than a pure plein-air (painted outdoors) study.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Under a stormy sunset sky a distant range of mountains is strung out along the horizon, in front of which lies a line of brown hills. In the foreground, standing at the edge of what is possibly an expanse of water, is a figure dressed in black and wearing a white hat. He is perhaps fishing. The immediate foreground is a mass of dark olive-brown undergrowth and vegetation, with trees to the left. This view was formerly  dated to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QD5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rousseau</a>’s 1830 trip to the Auvergne (for which see <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D3X-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Valley of Saint-Vincent</a></span>), and identified as a view of that region. It is now thought to date from later in his career, and has been associated with the trip he made in 1844 with Jule-Louis Dupré to the Landes, a region south of Bordeaux, and the Pyrenees. In his 1872 biography of Rousseau, Alfred Sensier wrote of how the pair, attracted by the desolate and inhospitable nature of the area, made a prolonged visit, staying for five months in all. Many of Rousseau’s views of the region feature a vast plain, often with a chain of mountains in the distance, for example <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Plain in front of the Pyrenees</span> (about 1845, Louvre, Paris). In our painting the mountains in the distance are probably also the Pyrenees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sky is thickly painted with multiple layers of blues, greys and pinks. Broad brushstrokes have been used to bring the sky paint down over the mountains on the horizon, in some cases obscuring their outlines. The area of water is even more thickly painted, with strong <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>. In places Rousseau had more than one colour on his brush, such as a mixture of creamy yellow, grey and a variety of greens. This thick application of paint and rigorous brushwork is certainly typical of Rousseau’s technique in the 1840s. The scene is painted on top of an earlier  composition, some of which is visible to the naked eye through thinner areas of paint. At the bottom right, for example, you can see a round bucket or barrel, its planks clearly delineated.  There is also a structure similar to a boat, complete with sails, lying underneath the paint layers.</p></div>

The buildings of 18th-century Rome take up the bottom third of the painting, while the upper two-thirds are given over to a scudding dance of black, grey and white clouds at dawn. The clouds seem to be moving particularly swiftly, and it is possible that the painting was not made out of doors but was based on a rapid pencil sketch with colour annotations, of a kind that Valenciennes is known to have made and used.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1788, one of George Augustus Wallis’s many patrons, Lord Warwick, financed a trip to Italy. Around that year he arrived in Naples, where he stayed for a number of years, before moving to Rome in 1795. He was nicknamed ‘le Poussin anglais’ by his fellow English artists, and his future son-in-law, the neo-classical painter Gottlieb Schick (1776 -1812) described him as ‘probably the foremost landscape painter in Rome’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is only since the late 1990s that the sketches made by Wallis in the Roman Campagna have come to light. This particular example is an essay in atmosphere. The countryside to the south of Rome is sombre and grey, a contrast to the sun-drenched landscape usually depicted in such studies. At the top, pale blue sky is glimpsed behind a bank of rolling grey clouds and an area of pink at the right hints at a sunset. But the chief subject is the driving rain, rendered in diagonal strokes of grey and increasing in intensity towards the left.</p></div>
