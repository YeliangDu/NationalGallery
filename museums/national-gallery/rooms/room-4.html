        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This grand double portrait by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PSX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Holbein</a>, the most accomplished portraitist of the sixteenth century, does more than show off the wealth and status of its sitters. It was painted at a time of religious upheaval in Europe – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SW8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Henry VIII, King of England</a>, would soon break with the Roman Catholic Church as the pope would not annul his marriage to his first wife, Catherine of Aragon. The objects on the table seem to allude to the complexities of the political climate. It’s also a supreme display of Holbein’s skill in composing images and in manipulating <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> to recreate a variety of textures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Holbein made this painting on his second trip to England in the early 1530s. We know that he was working on it in 1533 as he has dated it beneath his signature on the marble floor behind the figure on the left. The artist did not usually sign his paintings and the signature here is more elaborate than other known examples, suggesting that he was particularly proud of this work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the same year as the portrait was painted, Henry married his second wife, Anne Boleyn. He bypassed papal authority by doing so, establishing the Church of England as independent from Rome and placing himself at its head. The break of religious and political ties with Catholic Europe was worrying for Francis I, King of France. The man on the left is his ambassador Jean de Dinteville, whom he had tasked to report back to him on the situation. Dinteville, one of Francis’s most trusted courtiers, attended the wedding on the King’s behalf. This was his second diplomatic mission to England and he would visit the country a further three times, conveying messages between the two monarchs. The man to the right is his close friend Georges de Selve, Bishop of Lavaur. Selve was also on a diplomatic mission, although we do not know its exact nature. Four years earlier he had attended the Diet of Speyer, a conference at which the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a> Charles V attempted to reconcile Catholics and Protestants. Both men were in their twenties when this was painted: Latin inscriptions on the scabbard of Dinteville’s sword and the edge of the book on which Georges is leaning reveal that they are 28 and 24 years old respectively (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">aetatis suae</span> 25’, meaning ‘he is in his 25th year’).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dinteville was required to stay in London for Anne’s coronation in June and for the birth of Henry and Anne’s daughter Elizabeth in September (Francis was her godfather). Surviving correspondence reveals that Dinteville was very unhappy on his extended visit. He described himself as ‘the most melancholy, weary and wearisome ambassador that was ever seen’, but the arrival of his friend, who was in London briefly from April to June, cheered him up. This portrait commemorates their friendship, as well as this brief stint together in England. By placing the table between them, Holbein separates the two men but also provides them with a prop to lean on, so they appear to be posing naturally.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The table also offers space to display a wide range of objects. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> portraits often included objects such a musical instruments, coins, books or flowers, enriching the portrayal of the sitter by alluding to their hobbies, intellect, culture, marital status or religious fervour. As a group, these objects have been interpreted as a visual essay on the religious and political turmoil of mid-sixteenth-century Europe. The top shelf shows instruments used to measure time, altitude and the position of the stars and other celestial bodies. On the far left is a celestial globe, mapping the position of stars and planets; the multi-faceted box-like object with dials on each face is called a polyhedral dial, a type of sundial. Such objects were made by Henry VIII’s royal astronomer, Nicholas Kratzer: Holbein’s portrait showing Kratzer making a polyhedral dial is in the Louvre, Paris. Technical instruments like this were extremely precious, and their inclusion also shows off the men’s understanding of mathematics and science.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lower shelf is devoted mainly to music. It is dominated by a lute, its case abandoned face down on the floor; one of the strings is broken. The book to the left is an arithmetic book, wedged open with a set square on the page relating to mathematical division. Under the neck of the lute, resting on a set of flutes – one is missing, which suggests a lack of harmony – is a Lutheran hymn book. The script and score are clear enough to read, revealing that Holbein deliberately chose to show two pages which do not follow each other in the standard form of the Lutheran hymn book. The hymns are ‘Come Holy Ghost’ and ‘The Ten Commandments’, which Georges may have wanted to include because they express Christian unity. The globe on this shelf is terrestrial and includes the hamlet of Polisy, about 200 kilometres south-east of Paris, where Dinteville had his chateau and where this painting would hang: an inventory dated 1589 records it decorating the Great Hall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Visitors to Polisy would have been able to admire the grandeur and intellect of the sitter, whom we assume developed the picture’s rhetoric in conversation with the artist, as well as Holbein’s incredible technical skill. The sheen of Dinteville’s pink satin tunic is dazzling, its smoothness contrasting with the rich, dense lynx fur lining his black cape. Holbein has painted the individual hairs around its edges, giving a sense of its luxuriously soft texture. The gold tassels hanging from the scabbard of Dinteville’s dagger were created using Holbein’s usual <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilding</a> technique: he painted the individual strands in a brownish colour, covered them with a layer of oil mordant (a sticky substance which acted like a glue) and then secured gold leaf to create these delicate, swaying threads. Despite its detail, areas of the picture betray the speed with which Holbein was working. We can see the individual knots of the Turkish carpet on the table; the grey areas are underpainting which Holbein has simply left bare, only altering the tone slightly here and there to show how the textile ripples slightly at the edges.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> portraiture was often commissioned as a reminder of the frailty of life, or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERO-0008-0000-0000.htm">memento mori</a>. The most unusual element of the picture – a distorted, elongated object that appears to hover between the men’s feet – can only be seen properly if you look up at the painting from the bottom right corner.  Viewed from here, the shape reveals itself to be a large skull, an effect called anamorphosis which can also be seen in an unusual portrait of Henry’s son Edward VI in the National Portrait Gallery, London. Equally hidden at the top left of the picture, pinned to the green damask curtain, is a crucifix. It might hint at Christian unity because it expresses the universal hope of salvation through <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s sacrifice.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Giovanni Agostino della Torre was a second generation doctor from Bergamo, already in practice by 1465. The family had a pharmacy supplying spices, oils, drugs, pigments and chemicals in Piazza Vecchia, with a special line in selling vitriol (sulphuric acid). Agostino had taught at the famous University of Padua, and the costume he wears is official or academic dress; the belt and open sleeves suggest high rank. A similar coat is worn by Battista Fiera, physician to the Mantuan court, in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Costa’s portrait of him</a>. In 1510 Agostino was elected prior of Bergamo’s College of Physicians, an office he held until his death at age 81 on 7 June 1516.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the outer of the two folded papers in Agostino’s right hand is a Latin inscription: Medicorum Esculapio / Joanni Augustino Be/rgomatj:- (‘Giovanni Agostino of Bergamo’, then a reference to Aesculapius, the physician god of the ancient Greeks and Romans). The word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Consilium</span> (‘advice’) appears on the second paper beneath it. The texts on the two square pieces of paper below the inkstand are prescriptions. The paper label on the back cover of the book held by Agostino reads ‘Galienus’, meaning Galen, who was the great medical authority of the ancient world. The portrait is signed and dated on the chair: L. LOTVS././[1515].</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The folded paper resting on the table between the inkwell and Agostino’s shoulder translates from Latin: ‘To my dear friend the nobleman of Bergamo, Niccolò della Torre, Bergamo.’ This refers to the bearded man behind Agostino: his only son, Niccolò. As a supporter of the Venetians, when Bergamo fell to the French in 1510 Niccolò was saved from being expelled from the city by a petition written by one of his father’s patients. When Venetian rule was re-established after Spanish occupation of the city from 1513 to 1516, Niccolò was re-elected to the city council and was active in the political life of the city until his death at the age of 80 in 1563. The portrait not only depicts an eminent and learned physician but also his son, who was a figure of great wealth and considerable political importance in Bergamo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition suggests that Agostino was originally intended to be portrayed alone; Niccolò is crowded ungracefully into the background. If the sitters had been planned together, we would have expected some physical or psychological contact between them, as is found in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lotto</a>’s other, slightly later, double portraits. Niccolò appears to have been added after the portrait was composed and possibly originally completed. He was 33 in 1516 when his father died, and does not look much older here, so perhaps that was when he was added to the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The treatment of the flesh, the minutely marked lips and the carefully distinguished shadows of Agostino’s face are characteristic of Lotto’s early portraits. Also typical are the minute highlights in the irises. The unusual green colour of Agostino’s face, as well as the red rims of his eyes, is surely deliberate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The fly settled on Agostino’s handkerchief is a startling piece of realism. The painting of flies and their shadows – to make it look as if they had landed in or on the painting – was a demonstration of the magical, illusionistic power of paint. Lotto would have known examples in both Netherlandish and Italian art. It is here probably also a symbol of illness or death, emphasising the advanced age and frailty of the portrait’s main sitter.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A sumptuously dressed young woman stands between the back of an armchair and a table. In her left hand she holds a drawing of the Roman heroine Lucretia about to stab herself. She points towards this drawing and another paper on the table, on which are written Lucretia’s last words. The Latin phrase is difficult to translate but roughly means that by killing herself Lucretia will deprive unchaste women of a possible excuse for living.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the table is a yellow wallflower, a common wildflower in Italy, sometimes a lover’s gift. The woman wears a gold wedding band, and tucked into her bodice is a gold jewelled pendant decorated with two <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a> and two cornucopias. Such items were associated with weddings and known as bridal pendants. The empty chair may be intended to suggest the woman’s absent husband.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Lucretia, who lived in the early sixth century BC, is told in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Livy</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">History of Rome</span> (I LVII, 4–LX,4). Prince Sextus Tarquinius crept to Lucretia’s room at night, sword drawn, and threatened to rape her. She resisted; he then said he would kill her and a slave and allege they had committed adultery. Lucretia, who could not bear that dishonour, was raped by the prince. She told her father and husband, who were unable to dissuade her from killing herself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lucretia’s suicide saved her family from having to live with a woman believed to be contaminated. Notions of family honour and blood pollution were still as strong in Lotto’s time as they had been in Livy’s. The story of Lucretia was popular as a theme for furniture paintings, which were often made for newly-weds, suggesting that Lucretia was considered an inspiring model for wives even though suicide was against Christian doctrine. The sitter in Lotto’s portrait was very likely called Lucretia, as it was common at the time to be portrayed as a historical or holy namesake. She seems to indicate that she would follow her heroine’s example. This Lucretia, however, is not presented as a victim – the heroic and confident manner in which she stares straight at us is highly unusual.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She may be the Venetian noblewoman Lucrezia Valier, who married into the prominent Pesaro family, in whose possession the painting was later recorded in 1797. The force of her gesture and expression breaks with conventions for female portraits of the time. The horizontal format also makes this painting stand apart from Lotto’s earlier surviving independent portraits of women. Indeed, it was an innovation that he increasingly applied in this period, most often for male sitters, which allowed him space to include symbolic elements or texts.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait has been dated to the early 1530s on account of the sitter’s clothes and ribboned cap or<span class="dokuwiki_italic"> scufia</span>, partly made from human hair. Quite a few changes were made during painting, and it was originally a much more colourful picture. The background was not originally grey but had broad vertical stripes of pink and violet or lilac and blue. The tablecloth had blue stripes, and remains of this colour can still be seen around the edges of the paper and the flower which lie on it. A coloured representation of Lucretia is visible below the ink drawing on the sheet of paper. In it, her head is facing in the opposite direction and her arm is raised up high. This earlier version had a coloured background, most probably blue, with a white border. Enough of the blue shows through the drawing to make it resemble a print with a faint plate mark.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the earliest surviving example of a life-size, full-length portrait on canvas or panel painted in Italy. We are not certain of the sitter’s identity, but he may be Gerolamo II Avogadro of Brescia (who died in 1534). He was the father of Conte Faustino Avogadro, who is shown in a portrait by Moretto’s pupil, Moroni, which is also in the National Gallery’s collection. Here, he may once have been looking towards a companion portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s costume is sober but luxurious. He wears a Spanish-style black brocade cape, slashed mauve sleeves and breeches, and a red felted-wool cap that was a speciality of Brescia. His enamelled gold cap badge represents Saint Christopher carrying the infant Christ. His hand rests on a very early example of a rapier. Just behind and above its hilt is part of the hilt of a dagger, presumably one held in the left hand for parrying when fencing.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was once in the Avogadro family collection and it was suggested that it might represent Gerolamo II Avogadro of Brescia (who died in 1534). He was the father of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Conte Faustino Avogadro</a>, who is shown in the full-length portrait by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moretto</a>’s pupil, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni</a>. However, an Avogadro inventory of 1734 describes this painting as being of a member of the Conforto family, so the man’s identity remains uncertain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is dated 1526 in Roman numerals on the step below the man’s foot, and it is characteristic of Moretto’s early work. The distinctive yellow streaks in the marble can also be seen in his earliest documented painting, the organ shutters originally for the old cathedral in Brescia, now in S. Maria in Valvendra, Lovere, Bergamo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the only full-length portrait by Moretto to have survived. In fact, it seems to be the earliest surviving example in Italy of a life-size, full-length, independent portrait on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>. Such portraits were unusual in Italy but not in northern Europe. Life-sized, full-length portraits were frequently included as part of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> decorations in north Italian palaces or villas. Although painted on canvas, this portrait could have formed part of such a decorative scheme.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man is leaning against the pedestal of a column. Behind him is a low wall with an arched opening revealing a landscape. The greens of the trees have darkened and it is hard to be sure whether the landscape was originally meant to be this yellow. The arch echoes the curve of the man’s shoulders and draws our attention to his eyes, which look away from us. It is possible that he was once looking towards a companion portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His Spanish-style black brocade cape and slashed mauve sleeves and breeches are both sober and luxurious and his red cap is typical of Brescia. The city’s sumptuary laws, which controlled the wearing of luxury items, specified that men could only wear these <span class="dokuwiki_italic">berette</span> made of local felted wool. The enamelled gold cap badge represents <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Christopher</a> carrying the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. The image is surrounded by Greek letters which have not been explained, but which may have invoked the protection of the saint. The tight cap of gold thread and silk underneath the man’s red cap was designed to be worn beneath a helmet to cushion it, but was fashionable and widely adopted by those without a military life. The glove on his right hand, turned down and apparently ragged at the cuff, is similar to that found in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Man with a Glove</span> of about the same date (Louvre, Paris).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s hand rests on a very early example of a rapier. Just behind and above its hilt is part of the hilt of a dagger, presumably one held in the left hand for parrying when fencing.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This lavishly dressed sitter, wearing a coat lined with lynx or snow leopard fur, is the Brescian nobleman and humanist Fortunato Martinengo  (1512–1552). Ancient gold and silver coins and a bronze oil lamp in the shape of a foot on the table allude to his scholarly interests, and perhaps also to a pilgrimage to Jersualem that he planned to make. His pose, with his head resting on his hand, is associated with melancholy. The inscription in Greek on his cap means: ‘Alas, I yearn too much.’ It is unclear whether he longs for knowledge, for a person, or for the pilgrimage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait can be dated by the clothing to around 1540–5, when the sitter was around 30 years old. It may have been commissioned by Fortunato or his brothers as a memento before he undertook the dangerous journey to the Holy Land in 1541. In 1542 he married Livia, daughter of Count Nicolo d'Arco.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For more than a century this portrait has been the most famous and admired of all <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moretto</a>’s secular paintings. It represents the Brescian nobleman Fortunato Martinengo (1512–1552). Fortunato was a man of learning, and the founder of Brescia’s Accademia dei Dubbiosi (Academy of the Doubtful), which promoted the exchange of religious and intellectual ideas. The portrait may have been commissioned by Fortunato or his brothers before he set out on pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1541. He returned safely and, at the age of 30, married Livia, daughter of Count Nicolo d‘Arco.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Fortunato is seated before an expensive red velvet and gold silk damask curtain, leaning his head in his hand and his elbow on a pair of glazed silk cushions. A pair of grey leather gloves lie on the table with a selection of other apparently significant items. There are three ancient coins, two with imperial heads in silver and another, which may be gold, in a turned ivory or bone box. Beside the coins and gloves is an oil lamp in the shape of a foot wearing a sandal. An almost identical early sixteenth-century lamp survives in the Medieval Museum, Bologna. Such lamps, probably made in Padua, were perhaps intended to pass for antiquities.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is in a tradition of portraits of men seated with antiquities that appear to be more significant than mere collectors’ trophies. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Lotto</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Andrea Odoni</span> (Royal Collection) dated 1527 shows the sitter surrounded by fragments of ancient sculpture, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Parmigianino</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Collector</span> of about 1523 depicts the sitter with ancient coins, a little book and a relief sculpture. However, in both of these portraits the sitters assertively make eye contact, whereas Moretto’s sitter gazes distractedly into the distance, perhaps imagining the journey he is about to undertake.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His pose relates to traditional representations of Melancholy, such as the engraving <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Melancolia I</span> (1514) by the German Renaissance master, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>, in which dejected Melancolia sits surrounded by unused objects of art and science. Here Fortunato’s expression may relate to the inscription in Greek on his cap badge, which reads: ‘Ah, I yearn so strongly.’ The source of this motto is unknown but it suggests that his melancholy gaze is one of longing, his soul weighed down by intellect and contemplation. It is unclear whether he yearns for knowledge, possessions, a specific person, or for his imminent journey to Jerusalem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The grey marble wall behind the sitter restricts the space of the composition, intensifying the effect of opulence and introspection. A marble wall would have been unusual in a domestic setting, so it might be a marble door frame and the hanging behind the sitter may be a door hanging. These were common in Venetian homes and often made of expensive textiles. The red and gold damask here is clearly painted from an actual fabric of silk velvet cloth of gold. The projection of Fortunato’s knees is not emphasised and the lynx or snow leopard fur lining of his gown falls unbroken over them, making the space of the portrait appear even shallower. There are at least five other examples of portraits by Moretto in which the figure is seated, thigh-length, with an elbow on a table – Moretto or his patrons appear to have favoured this format.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a>’s portrait of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland</span> (Petworth House, Sussex) of about 1633 was very likely inspired by this painting.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait was long known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Il Cavaliere dal Piede Ferito</span>’ (‘The knight with the wounded foot’). But the brace supporting the man’s left foot suggests he was suffering from foot-drop, a fairly common disorder caused by the failure of ankle muscles weakened by disease or inflammation. It’s unusual to find a disorder featured so prominently in a sixteenth-century portrait of this type. Perhaps it was regarded as the consequence of a heroic exercise or the man was thought heroic for fighting despite his disability.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man rests his arm on his helmet and parts of his armour are scattered across the floor. This plate armour is of a type that was made in north Italy in the mid-sixteenth century. The way in which it has been carelessly strewn about in this portrait is very unusual and unexplained. The ruined setting may be intended to highlight the endurance of virtues which the sitter represents.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter is wearing a doublet of unstained, padded leather – known as an arming doublet – to which chain mail is laced to provide protection where there are gaps in the armour. A black satin doublet and white shirt are worn beneath this. The trunks are black and neither puffed nor rounded, which may suggest that the portrait dates to before 1560. The man’s cap of black velvet is decorated with black and white ostrich feathers. His plumed helmet would have been used at a tournament rather than in battle. His sword is a rapier, also for use in tournaments, and is luxuriously inlaid with gold and silver.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The repetition of colours in different parts of the painting is typical of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni</a>: the duck-egg blue of the sky also appears in the veins of the marble panels and the rusty stains in the stone pick up the colours of the beard and the doublet. The ivy and brown weeds below the fig tree must be of copper green which has discoloured. The various blacks may have been more easy to distinguish originally: the black trunk, codpiece, hose and shoes all differ in texture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An inventory of 1715 of the Avogadro collection in Brescia describes this painting as showing Conte Faustino Avogadro. He was married to Lucia Albani (possibly depicted by Moroni in ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">La Dama in Rosso</a></span>’)  and was caught up in the feud between the Brembati and the Albani families that divided Bergamo in the mid-sixteenth century. Faustino may have been implicated in the assassination of Conte Achille Brembati – one of his servants was certainly among those condemned to die for the crime. Faustino went into exile in Ferrara. A year later, in 1564, he fell blind drunk into a well and died.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is similar to Moroni’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Man</span>, probably Michel de l'Hospital, dated 1554 (Ambrosiana, Milan). Here however, the arrangement and lighting are reversed. It is possible that this portrait was made to hang with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moretto</a>’s earlier <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>, dated 1526, which may also depict a member of the Avogadro family, possibly Faustino’s father, Gerolamo II Avogadro.</p></div>

The distinctive braided vertical slits on her dress and the checked pattern of her under-dress all suggest a date towards the end of the 1550s. Her fan is unusual and it is curious that its handle is concealed: this was generally the most precious part, which was subject to sumptuary laws that restricted the wearing of luxury items.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An inventory of 1715 from the Avogadro palace in Brescia identifies the sitter as the Contessa Lucia, wife of Faustino Avogadro, who is thought to be the man portrayed in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN6-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Knight with his Jousting Helmet</a></span>. It might be expected that portraits of a husband and wife by the same artist in the same collection would be similar in appearance. In fact, the two pictures are different in size and their settings have nothing in common. Her portrait is designed to be viewed with our eyes more or less level with those of the sitter, whereas his portrait is designed to be seen from below. The sitters do not look towards each other, as is usual in pendant portraits of a husband and wife, but both are turned to the right, their eyes meeting ours. It is unlikely that these two portraits were intended to be displayed as a pair. However, Moroni’s portraits of Gian Gerolamo Grumelli and his second wife Isotta Brembati (collection of Conti Moroni in Bergamo), which have always been kept together, were not made at the same date and display the same differences as the National Gallery’s paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lucia Albani Avogadro was the daughter of the Bergamask nobleman Giangirolamo Albani (1509–91) and the Venetian aristocrat Laura Longhi. Her father was painted by Moroni in about 1565–70 (Roncalli Collection, Rome) and her grandfather, Francesco Albani, is probably the sitter in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cariani’s portrait</a>, also in our collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lucia was born about 1534 and married her kinsman Faustino Avogadro of Brescia in 1550. She took great delight in literature and poetry and is said to have to have written a series of sonnets when she was 15 or 16 years old. Her literary reputation was also praised after her marriage and her sonnets were collected after her death in a manuscript decorated with her profile portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When a feud between the Albani and Brembati families culminated in the assassination of Conte Achille Brembati in S. Maria Maggiore in 1563, Lucia and her husband left Brescia for Ferrara. He died there in the following year and she seems to have died shortly before 1568. She was survived by three sons. If this portrait does represent Lucia Albani, it probably dates from before 1563, when she left Brescia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Strips of canvas have been added at the upper and lower edges, probably during a restoration in the eighteenth century. This may have been a response to Moroni’s frequent practice of leaving very little space between the top of the sitter’s head and the edge of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait has long been known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">L’Avvocato</span>‘, meaning the lawyer or counsel in Italian. The sitter’s air of well-paid theatricality and his supercilious regard as though he is summing up the evidence, may have suggested this title. It might also derive from a misreading of the folded letter in his hand.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The first line of the handwritten address reads ’Al Magº Sig Julii (‘to the most worshipful Lord Giulio or Giuliano’). ‘Magº’ may have been read as an abbreviation for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Magistrato</span> (‘magistrate’) rather than <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Magnifico</span> (‘worshipful’). The second line is very hard to make out but the letters seem to be ‘S’, ‘piel’, ‘mnio’ – perhaps a name but otherwise meaningless – and the final word is concealed by the man’s thumb. The third and separate line consists of a single word which begins with an R. On a letter, this would be the location. It has been read as many places but the most likely is probably ‘Romano’ meaning Romano di Lombardia, near Bergamo. This was a town in which Moroni certainly had clients.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni</a>’s most expressive works. It relies on the hands as well as the head for its dramatic effect, and also the way in which the composition in structured. As in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G3D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man with Raised Eyebrows</a></span>, Moroni has used shadow as a compositional device. He creates a diagonal from the upper right to lower left corner. The diagonal is first in the shaded background, then it skims the sitter’s shoulder, wrist and the edge of the letter. It is also echoed in the pointing finger of the other hand. The turn, tilt and frown of the face all depend for their effect on their contrast with this diagonal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The plain background and extremely limited colour palette of mainly black, white and greys focus our attention on the sitter’s head and hands with dramatic effect. The gold ring on his little finger stands out in this almost monochrome image to draw our gaze to the man’s left hand, hooked in his belt, making it an equal focus to his right, which holds the letter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The trim of the beard and the costume suggest a date of around 1570. The extremely subtle gradation of the grey background is also characteristic of the artist’s later work, as is the use of the diagonal. Moroni’s famous painting known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Titian’s Schoolmaster</span>’ (National Gallery of Art, Washington) is the finest example of this.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Much of the original black paint was severely burnt and then repainted, probably when the picture was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVV-0008-0000-0000.htm">relined</a> during the nineteenth century. During this process another <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> was attached to the reverse of the original to enlarge the painting all round by an inch. This was probably in response to Moroni’s practice of leaving very little space between the figure and the edge of the canvas, which resulted in many of his portraits being extended in later years as taste changed. Tests reveal that almost nothing of the original black paint now remains. The satin stripes in the clothes have survived, probably because of the white lead that was added to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> when the paint was made. The white cuffs, ruff and paper are well preserved, as is the flesh. The figure’s left hand may have been painted over the black clothes as the black beneath now seems to be showing through.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young man wearing a fustian jacket decorated with a pattern of small slashes and full red slashed breeches glances up from his work. He looks directly at us, creating a strong sense of intimacy. A gold ring set with a ruby glints on his little finger and he holds a pair of cloth shears, as though he is about to cut the black fabric marked with white chalk lines on the table in front of him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait does not appear to be posed but seems to capture a fleeting moment, like a snapshot. It as though we have interrupted the man, like customers entering his shop. He reacts to our presence and stops what he is doing for a moment. The portrait’s vitality, expressive impact and psychological realism are highly unconventional and unusual for the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni</a>’s most famous paintings. The dress and the style of the painting suggest that he made it late in his career, around 1570. Moroni’s early portraits, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN6-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Knight with his Jousting Helmet</a></span>, depict members of the provincial nobility, professionals, clergymen and intellectuals, reflecting his success with the highest levels of Bergamask society. During the 1560s he began to paint sitters of more modest occupation. This change seems to have coincided with the unstable political situation in Bergamo and Moroni’s return to his provincial hometown of Albino toward the end of the decade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Italian author and satirist, Pietro Aretino (1492–1556), lamented in a letter of 1554 that he lived in a degenerate age in which ‘even the tailors and vintners are given life by painters’. However, this tailor’s clothes are those of a successful, middle-class professional rather than an artisan. The belt he wears around his waist has a loop for a sword, which is more significant than the shears as an indicator of his status: only men of some social standing were permitted to carry a sword. He may have been a senior officer of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">guild</a>, proud to be portrayed at his work, or a cloth merchant. Some members of the tailor’s profession were of a similarly high status to court painters, especially if they had important clients. A portrait by Girolamo Bedoli (1500–1569) now in the Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples, showing a man with an iron rule, pair of cloth shears and a length of sumptuous damask, is described in old inventories as a tailor in the service of Pope Paul III. Several artists were related to tailors, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea del Sarto</a>, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Agostino</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If it was modest not to wear a sword when you had a right to do so, it was even more modest to be depicted holding shears if there was no need. The right to carry arms indicated that you had a name and family honour to defend, but handling tools potentially lowered your status. In Genoa in the second half of the sixteenth century a citizen could be ennobled if he were involved in the wholesale cloth trade, but not if he engaged in retail or manual labour such as ‘weighing, cutting and measuring’. Painters were sensitive to such distinctions, but Moroni emphasises the dignity in skilled work. He painted what is probably the only <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> image of a great artist that emphasises the nobility of manual labour: his portrait of the great Venetian sculptor Alessandro Vittoria (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) shows him holding a sculpted marble torso with his sleeve rolled up, displaying a muscular, veined forearm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Moroni painted directly from life without making preliminary drawings and this method adds to the portrait’s vividness and spontaneity. Some of the most lovely passages were painted on top of paint that was still wet – for example the grey mixed with ginger in the tailor’s beard, the fine dark hair at his temple and the grey in the shadows in the tunic. The flesh is rather thinly painted as is typical of some of Moroni’s last paintings – the texture of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> is clearly visible. In the slashed areas of the breeches the contrast between pale yellow and moss green paint may have originally been softened with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSE-0008-0000-0000.htm">glaze</a> but now appears very abrupt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The colours of the tailor’s own costume contrast with the black fabric he is preparing to cut. His outfit is unlike that worn by most of the sitters in Moroni’s later portraits, such as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Leonardo Salvagno (?)</a></span>, as they are dressed in black in the Spanish fashion that persisted into the next century. The muted grey background, however, is similar to those found in other late portraits by Moroni, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man holding a Letter</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G3D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man with Raised Eyebrows</a></span>. The scene is lit from above and to the left, the light glistening on the sitter’s forehead and nose. Moroni has used shadow to create a diagonal from top left to lower right across the composition, which is continued down the tailor’s left arm to the cloth on the table. His head is tilted away from this diagonal, drawing our attention to his face and expression, as well as leading our eye to his hands, which also express character. This compositional device can also be seen in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man holding a Letter</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Moroni’s portraits up to about 1560 typically have a high sheen and sharp focus which links them to the work of Lombard painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lotto</a> and Moroni’s teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moretto</a>. This picture has a softer, more atmospheric quality, which owes much to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and Venetian painting. But Moroni’s realism is unlike Titian’s idealised portraits. His emphasis on truth to nature may have been morally as well as aesthetically motivated. It was formed in a spiritual climate of religious reform during the Council of Trent (1545–1563), a city in and around which Moroni worked. Cardinal Gabriele Paleotti’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Discourse on Sacred and Profane Images</span> (published 1582), which expresses Counter-Reformation ideas about art, encouraged an ‘honest’ or ‘true and natural’ mode of portraiture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> was lined with another larger canvas in 1863 and the painted area extended by two or three centimetres on each side, as the composition was originally very tightly cropped. This was also the case with many of Moroni’s other portraits, which were also extended to accord with later taste.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This thoughtful man, probably in his late twenties, is richly dressed in a padded maroon jacket with dark blue stripes on the puffed sleeves. Over this he wears a brown fur cape. He holds a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERT-0008-0000-0000.htm">rosary</a> and his left hand rests on a book tied with blue ribbons. He wears one leather glove and holds the other in the right hand. Round his neck is a type of fine gold chain worn by the minor nobility.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The book and the laurels behind the man suggest that he may have been a poet. The laurel tree was the attribute of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E91-0008-0000-0000.htm">Apollo</a>, Roman god of poetry and music. Poets were traditionally crowned with laurel leaves, hence the title ‘poet laureate’. The rosary suggests that the man’s artistic interests are balanced by his spiritual concerns. The dark background and olive leaves recall <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Laura</span> of 1506, now in the Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the basis of the clothing, the painting probably dates from about 1516. This was when the epic poem <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Orlando Furioso</span> was first published and achieved instant fame, and it has been proposed that the portrait is of the author, Lodovico Ariosto (1474–1533). However, Ariosto would have been 41 or 42 in 1516, which seems too old for the man in this painting. There is no evidence that Ariosto, who was from Ferrara, ever sat for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q22-0001-0000-0000.htm">Palma Vecchio</a>, who worked in Venice. Equally, although Ariosto mentioned the contemporary Venetian painters <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Orlando Furioso</span>, he did not mention Palma Vecchio, which suggests that he was not familiar with him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The expanded 1532 edition of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Orlando Furioso</span> contains a woodcut portrait of Ariosto based on a drawing by Titian, which does not look like the sitter in the National Gallery’s painting. Nor does the description of Ariosto in the 1562 edition – as a man with black curly hair, olive skin, thin lips, a thin beard which didn't cover the chin as far as the ears and a big curved, aquiline nose – seem to fit this man.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter in the portrait looks similar in appearance and mood to one in a bust-length portrait thought to be by Titian in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. However in that painting the sitter is turned to the side and probably once had his arm resting on a parapet in a pose similar to that in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DCU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo</a></span>. The Metropolitan Museum portrait has been significantly cut down. It does not include either the laurels or the book that appear in Palma Vecchio’s picture. Although the sitters look similar, the relationship between these two paintings, if any, is unclear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery painting is one of Palma Vecchio’s earliest successful portraits and may have inspired Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Man with a Glove</span> (Louvre, Paris). The portrait is damaged in several places, which have been repainted. The surface is also rubbed, meaning that the some of the subtleties of the paint texture and fine details have been lost, for example in the hair and the golden chain.</p></div>

Parmigianino has painted out the original top contour of the hat to make it smaller – the original shape can still be seen through the overpaint. The man appears to be sitting in front of an open window through which a dark cloudy sky and brightly lit copse of trees can be seen. The main light source is from the front, but there is also light coming from the horizon casting an almost supernaturally bright golden glow on the relief sculpture and the leaves of the trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter has an unusual expression, almost a sneer – his nostrils are flared, his lips pursed and forehead lined. His eyes do not fix on us but appear to be watching something slightly to our left. He is shown holding the so-called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Durazzo Book of Hours</span> by Francesco Marmitta, created about 20 years earlier (now in the Biblioteca Civica Berio, Genoa). Parmigianino has accurately represented the book’s elaborately tooled metal cover, with red stones on the metal clasps. A broken fragment of a pseudo-antique relief of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mars</a> stands in the background. The ‘antique’ figures are constructed in Parmigianino’s own sinuous style.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter’s right hand lies on the inlaid wooden table, on which rests a bronze statuette of a woman. She holds a baton or possibly a dagger which she points towards her abdomen. She may represent the Roman heroine Lucretia who stabbed herself to defend her honour. The bronze statuette was painted on top of the inlay on the table and the marquetry stripe now shows through the paint, which has become transparent with age. Beside the statuette lie four ancient coins. There was considerable interest in ancient coins among collectors in Parma at this time. Three of the coins are bronze <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sestercii</span>, but the third is made of silver. It is the depiction of a real coin – a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">denarius</span> struck in Rome in 56 BC bearing the head of Ancus Marcius, the fourth king of Rome (reigned 642–617 BC).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The antique objects surrounding the man reveal his cultured tastes, while the Breviary in his hand attests to his Christian faith. A similar message is expressed in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Lotto</a>’s somewhat later <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of Andrea Odoni</span> (Royal Collection Trust) in which the sitter is surrounded by antique artefacts but holds a Crucifix pendant to his heart as testament of his devotion to Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Parmigianino’s painting, the background above the sitter’s head has been loosely brushed in – the pale colour of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> is visible through the long sweeping strokes. In the sky, Parmigianino has used lots of tiny unblended brushstrokes to suggest the tumultuous clouds. The leaves of the trees were also created by small strokes of green paint, the paler tones laid on top of the darker ones. These varied expressive brushstrokes enhance the dramatic impact of the image.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>There is an astonishing immediacy to this portrait, but we do not know the identity of the sitter. According to the elaborate inscription at the top of the canvas, he is 56 years old. His advancing age is charted in the creases on his forehead and the papery skin around his eyes; the soft flesh a stark contrast to the harsh lines of his wiry beard and moustache.</p><p>Pourbus takes this opportunity to display his tremendous skill in depicting different textures, as seen in the diaphanous ruff, the quilted satin sleeves and the soft kid glove held in the man’s right hand. Nothing alludes to the sitter’s profession, although his assumed confidence and refined costume suggest he was a figure of some standing. The pendant portrait of his wife, now in the Museum of Fine Arts in San Francisco, shows her in equally sophisticated dress. The two paintings once hung together at Schloss Weissenstein in Pommersfelden until they were separated in a sale of part of the collection in 1867.</p><p>The shrewd characterisation seen here defined Pourbus’s early career in Antwerp. In 1591, the year this portrait was painted, he had been accepted as a master to the Guild of Saint Luke at the age of twenty-two. His prodigious talent was recognised by the merchant and patrician classes during these years, and he later went on to serve the royal and ducal courts in Brussels, Mantua and Paris.</p><p>The hyper-realism achieved in early works such as this, combined with an unprecedented vigour and sense of character, was fundamental in laying the foundations for the naturalistic style that would come to dominate Dutch and Flemish portrait painting of the seventeenth century.</p></div>
