Long shadows are cast by the bushes and tree on the left . There is an even, harmonious tonality throughout, from the soft grey-greens of the foliage, to the lavender blue of the hills and the pale blue of the sky. The view is near Dardagny, a village in Switzerland west of Geneva, and in the background it is the hills of the Jura which descend from left to right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps influenced by his Swiss maternal grandfather, Corot visited Switzerland more than any other country in Europe. In 1825, on his way to Italy, he stayed in Lausanne. In 1852 he visited the country in the company of the painters Armand Leleux (1818–1885) and  Charles Daubigny. When he returned the following year he was invited to stay with Leleux’s parents-in-law in Dardagny, and it was during this visit that he almost certainly painted this view. He was there during July and August, when he would have seen the fields full of ripe corn which are depicted on either side of the path.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The brushwork is fluid, the paint thin, and in many places the weave of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> shows through. Corot would have started this view in the open air, perhaps adding such details as the figure and the cow back in the studio. The figure of the woman also appears in a wash ink drawing Corot made in a sketchbook, which he could have referred to when placing her in the painting itself. Corot had a number of friends in Switzerland, including Charles Turrettini and his sister, Suzanne Turrettini-Necker, who was a pupil of Barthélemy Menn (1815–1893) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PLY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alexandre Calame</a>. Corot had a habit of lending his sketches to her, including this one, of which she made her own copy.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A supremely poised young woman is painted in three-quarter view. Her right hand curls around the handle of a mirror, while she appears to be caressing a lock of hair with her left. She wears a white blouse under a black velvet bodice which is trimmed with red ribbon, and over her arms yellow detachable sleeves, decorated with a blue bow from which three blue ribbons fall. This study is one of a number that Corot painted during the last years of his life, many of which are characterised by an air of introspection and melancholy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to an early biographer, Etienne Moreau-Nélaton, he would take a week out from painting landscapes to concentrate on capturing on canvas the special qualities of a particular model, the identity of whom is often not known. The origins of these studies lay in his first visit to Italy in 1825–8, when he not only painted the landscape but also made studies of the people, including several of women dressed in traditional costume.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The different pieces of clothing included here also appear in other paintings by Corot. The black bodice actually belongs to a dress which can be seen in its entirety in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Reader</span> (1868, Minneapolis Institute of Art), and the sleeves, sometimes minus their blue ribbons, can be seen in a number of studies of women, of which the earliest is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Woman with a Pansy</span> (1855–8, Denver Museum of Art). These sleeves were part of Italian traditional costume, and were tied over an undergarment allowing it to show, and in some cases billow out over the top. Corot kept assorted articles of dress in his studio with which to clothe his models. He was particularly interested in Italian costume, and in 1857 he asked for items to be sent from Albano, near Rome. In his depictions of such dress he was not interested in authenticity, but took delight in mixing up the different pieces to create a pleasing juxtaposition of colours and textures.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this view a sandy road leads from the immediate foreground to a cluster of sunlit buildings in the centre background. A further group, towards the left, is much hazier in appearance, and those surrounding the church appear to dissolve into the grey hills beyond. The first group depicts the village of Saintry, near Corbeil on the banks of the Seine, about 20 miles south-east of Paris. The square tower with its pointed roof is a dovecot,  the last remaining building of a former château, and still stands next to the town hall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The buildings to the left are probably those of a different village, Morsang-sur-Seine. The prominent tower belongs to the church of Saint-Germain. While attending a family celebration in May 1873, Corot painted the first version of this view, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saintry, near Corbeil. La Route Blanche</span> (private collection). A year later he painted this second version, almost certainly in the studio, shifting the viewpoint slightly and changing some of the details. In the first picture there is no wagon but more people, including a woman with a brown cow standing under the tree at the left. Corot obviously thought about including her in this second painting, as a ghostly figure is visible under the tree, sketched in but never finished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his later years Corot painted substantial numbers of ‘souvenirs’, or paintings based on memories of actual places, in some cases juxtaposing elements from different landscapes to form a harmonious whole. This painting could also be described as a repetition or variant as it is so close to the first version, and Corot could well have painted it with the original next to him. Some elements, such as the row of shimmering trees on the right, are typical of Corot’s late studio style. Yet the composition as a whole retains a real sense of the original landscape.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Honoré-Victorin Daumier (1808–1879) often used Miguel de Cervantes’s comic novel <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Don Quixote</span> as a source for paintings and drawings. These always feature Don Quixote himself, who is usually accompanied by his faithful companion, Sancho Panza. This picture probably depicts the incident when Don Quixote, on horseback in the centre of the painting, charges at a cloud of dust, which he has mistaken for two armies about to do battle. Sancho Panza, who sits on a mule on the right, drinks from a flagon, having explained to the Don that the dust is caused by flocks of sheep.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small and almost monochrome oil painting on a wood panel is most likely a trial or preliminary sketch for a larger painting now in an American collection. Daumier’s profession as a caricaturist is evident in his use of swiftly sketched outlines and dramatic contrasts of light and dark to convey the essential components of the narrative without unnecessary detail.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Don Quixote, the hero of Miguel de Cervantes’s novel <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Don Quixote</span>, preoccupied Daumier throughout his career, particularly in his later years. Published in two volumes in 1605 and 1615, the novel quickly became a popular choice for French artists and illustrators. Daumier first submitted a painting of Don Quixote to the Paris <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1850–51 and some 30 paintings and around 40 drawings relating to Cervantes’s novel survive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Yet despite his fascination with the novel, Daumier rarely depicted its many incidental characters. Instead, he focused almost exclusively on Don Quixote himself and his loyal squire and companion, Sancho Panza. This painting probably depicts the moment when Don Quixote charges at a cloud of dust caused by flocks of sheep, after mistaking it for two armies. Daumier does not show the sheep as, in keeping with the novel, the significance of the dust cloud depends upon who is looking at it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture – an oil sketch on panel – is of particular interest for the insights it provides into Daumier’s painting methods. Daumier worked primarily as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGX-0008-0000-0000.htm">lithographer</a>, producing caricatures and illustrations for satirical newspapers and journals, and his training as a graphic artist is evident here, where he effectively draws in paint. Daumier sketches a rough drawing and applies oil paint in thin, loosely brushed translucent washes. Broad areas of white primer and colour block out contrasting areas of light and shadow. Dark contours and silhouette provide definition and outline.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Daumier creates generalised impressions rather than providing detailed representations: the distinct personalities of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are suggested by body shape and movement rather than by facial expression or clothes and objects. He gives Don Quixote and Sancho Panza specific characteristics: Don Quixote’s tall, lean and angular physique is the opposite of Sancho Panza’s short stocky figure. These attributes are echoed in their respective mounts. Don Quixote’s large white horse, Rocinante, is skinny and energetic, while Sancho Panza’s brown mule is squat and lethargic. Situated within the barren landscape of La Mancha in central Spain, the immobile Sancho Panza (typically drinking from a flagon) contrasts with Don Quixote, who gallops headlong towards the distant hills. As in several of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Don Quixote</span> pictures, Daumier uses a diagonal axis, running right to left from the donkey’s neck and along Don Quixote’s lance and raised left arm, to create an effect of dynamic movement and spatial depth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The contrasting personalities of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza are full of comic possibilities, as Cervantes juxtaposes the tragi-comic qualities of Don Quixote’s outmoded chivalry with the pragmatism of his companion. But the ageing Daumier, who had spent his professional career lampooning corruption and self-interest, may also have had a more personal identification with Don Quixote, seeing in him a fellow idealist battling to uphold his values.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A maid combs the hair of a  girl who has been swimming; her bathing suit is stretched out on the ground to dry. Other objects – two parasols, a basket and a summer bonnet – are scattered around them. In the background, a family group – some members wrapped in towels – is leaving the shoreline, as other people stroll on the beach.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was painted with <span class="dokuwiki_italic">essence</span> – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> from which most of the oil has been removed with blotting paper, which is diluted with turpentine to give the effect of watercolour. It is one of four paintings of beach scenes that Degas completed in around 1869. That year he travelled to the northern French coast and made a series of landscapes in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a>. While some of the pastels may have been completed on site, Degas later stated that this picture had been finished in the studio, commenting, ‘the air you breathe in a picture is not necessarily the same as the air you breathe out of doors’. All four beach paintings include young women beside the sea, bathing, attending to their hair or resting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Small paintings of beach and seaside scenes in resorts such as Trouville were popular with several of Degas’s contemporaries, including Whistler, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Boudin</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>. An immediate precedent was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Beach at Boulogne</span> (Museum of Fine Arts, Richmond Virginia), from which Degas borrowed various elements. The two artists had a friendly but competitive relationship, and may well have travelled together to the channel coast in 1869. Both paintings have three horizontal bands for the sandy beach, turquoise-green sea and grey sky. Both also have sailboats in the distance – curiously, smoke from the two steamboats in Degas’s picture blows in opposite directions – and a scattering of bathers and walkers on the beach. Degas had originally planned to include a bathing machine, as Manet had, but he later removed it. Manet’s figures are of more or less of equal size, but Degas gives much greater emphasis to the girl and her maid.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas may have decided to paint beach scenes partly for commercial reasons, as marine subjects were popular with art buyers, particularly in England. He was familiar with British maritime pictures, but his painting is also profoundly influenced by Japanese woodblock prints. He especially admired the work of Ando Hiroshige (1797–1858), and owned over 40 of his landscapes. Hiroshige specialised in spacious panoramas which often contained little more than waves, rocks and sail boats in the distance to emphasise the contrast between the vast ocean and the deserted shore. Degas adopted the distinct spatial composition of Japanese prints, and several of their recurrent motifs, including a woman combing her hair or having it combed, also became part of his own repertoire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Japanese prints were often made as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptychs</a>, and the fact that this picture consists of three sheets of paper stuck together might seem to echo this construction. However, the addition of sheets either side of the central section containing the girl was most likely due to Degas’s decision to expand and modify the composition. The painting was owned by Henri Rouart, the father of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DAB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hélène Rouart</a>, whose portrait was painted by Degas. The beach scene was exhibited at the Third Impressionist Exhibition in 1877.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Princess Pauline Sander (1836–1921) was the wife of Prince Richard Metternich, the Austro-Hungarian Ambassador at the court of Napoleon III from 1860 to 1871. Known as the ‘ambassadress of pleasure’, she was a glamorous figure in Parisian high society during the Second Empire. A pioneer of fashion, she promoted new styles of dress, including the crinoline.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Princess had already been painted by the society portraitist Franz Xaver Winterhalter, and by the seascape artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eugène Boudin</a>, who showed her standing in profile on a beach. Degas may have seen the couple at the racetrack or ballet – the Prince was a leading member of the Jockey Club, which had an important role in both horse racing and in the running of the Paris Opera – but the young artist did not paint his portrait from life. Instead, he made a partial copy of a full-length carte de visite (visiting card) photograph of the Princess and her husband taken around 1867 by Eugène Disdéri (1819–1889). Disdéri had made his fortune by popularising the carte de visite, which he patented in 1854. These were made by gluing a small photograph to a card mount, which was the size of a standard visiting card.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the photograph, Princess Pauline stands alongside her husband, her left arm entwined in his right. In his portrait, however, Degas has removed the Prince completely and also the Princess’s left arm. She is isolated against a background of floral wallpaper, which overlaps her right sleeve. The close repetition of the floral motif, which has been drawn with graphite pencil and then covered with a wash of paint, suggests that Degas may have traced the pattern directly onto the canvas. Unlike the photograph, Degas’s picture is in colour, albeit very limited in range. Two colours dominate – variations of a mustard or Naples yellow with a greenish tinge, which takes on an antique gold hue for the wallpaper, and variations of a grey-black for the dress and hair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas has retained the military style of the Princess’s bodice, but the picture’s flat background helps project her forward in space, an effect enhanced by the thicker paint on her face, hair and clothes. The painting of the face itself is particularly striking, especially when compared with the photograph. Despite its small size, the carte de visite has a sharply focused clarity and strong shadows, but Degas has softened the Princess’s features, notably her eyes. In the photograph her mouth is made prominent by shadow, but Degas paints it using just a single thin line of black paint that is barely visible in places. Her nose is reduced to two judiciously placed – and slightly asymmetrical – black dots for the nostrils. Above all, Degas creates a remarkable effect of blurred movement – as if the Princess has been caught just as she turns her head – that is not present in the photograph’s more formal pose.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the first portraits to have been based on a photograph, and Degas makes no attempt to disguise its photographic origin. He remained deeply interested in photography, and a number of his paintings reveal his careful study of this new medium.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In April 1859 Edgar Degas returned to Paris, having spent the previous three years in Italy studying and copying old masters. Still in his twenties, he now sought to establish himself as a successful painter. At the time, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history painting</a> was the most highly regarded <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre</a> of art, particularly if a picture was well-received at the annual <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> in Paris. During the first half of the 1860s Degas produced five large-scale history paintings, of which this is one. However, it was never shown at the Salon and remained in his studio for the rest of his life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas carried out further revisions on this painting around 1879–80 and may even have continued working on it further (it was never <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR1-0008-0000-0000.htm">varnished</a>). Writing in 1924, his friend Daniel Halévy recalled: ‘Later in his life, Degas was very attached to this work; he drew it forth from the secret reserves in which he concealed his lifetime’s labours and placed it clearly in view on an easel in front of which he would often stop – a notable honour and a sign of predilection.’ The caricaturist Jean-Louis Forain similarly recalled: ‘the fondness that [Degas] had, in his later years, for the old picture that he [had] placed on an easel.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clearly, the painting had great significance for Degas, not least perhaps as a reminder both to himself and to studio visitors that he was more than just a ‘painter of dancers’. For Degas, the painting was a statement – even a manifesto – that spoke of his early commitment to history painting. His decision to become a history painter was inspired in part by Ingres, who on meeting Degas in 1855 advised him to ‘draw lines young man, many lines, from memory or from nature’. However, Degas also looked to the great <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4M-0008-0000-0000.htm">Romantic</a> artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Delacroix</a>. Degas’s history paintings, and much of his subsequent work, built upon the influence of both Ingres and Delacroix, as he combined the careful preparation, anatomical accuracy and precise draughtsmanship of the former with the dynamism and colour of the latter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Young Spartans Exercising</span> Degas chose a well-known anecdote about Spartan education, but one seldom taken up by artists. In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Life of Lycurgus</span>, the Roman historian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EA9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Plutarch</a> described how the Spartan legislator ordered girls to engage in exercise – including running, wrestling and throwing the discus and javelin – and to ‘good-naturedly’ challenge boys. Paraphrasing Plutarch, Degas wrote in one of his notebooks: ‘young girls and boys wrestling in the plane-tree grove, under the eye of the aged Lycurgus, beside the mothers.’ Degas did not rely exclusively on Plutarch for his image of Sparta and read widely on the topic, including Abbé Barthélémy’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Travels of Anacharsis the Younger in Ancient Greece</span> (1787), which further embellished Plutarch’s account. Degas was also familiar with accounts of current archaeological research into ancient Greece, particularly Ernest Béule’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Studies on the Peloponnese</span> (1855), which praised the values of Spartan society, particularly its celebration of youthful strength and beauty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shows the open plains of Sparta with no sign of the plane-tree grove noted by Degas. In the middle distance a group of women, the mothers of the children, surround the elderly Lycurgus, who drew up the laws of Sparta. Beyond them in the distance is the city of Sparta, which is overlooked on the left by Mount Taygetus, from which unwanted Spartan infants were thrown. The foreground is dominated by two opposing groups. Four girls appear to be taunting five nude boys, although it has been suggested that this is a scene of courtship rather than competition, as aspects of the girls’ hairstyles and poses correspond with accounts of such rituals in Plutarch’s writing. The lunging gesture of one of the young women might be one of enticement, not aggression. However, the picture’s significance perhaps lies less in its literary sources than in the tension between Degas’s classicism and his modernity, in particular his realisation that he could not present an image of an idealised classical past forever frozen in time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas also realised the subject would provide him with an opportunity to display his skill in depicting the nude. However, he had difficulties with the overall composition in his first full-scale attempt at the painting (now in The Art Institute, Chicago) and abandoned it. Although less finished, that <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a></span> picture includes a more detailed landscape and a classical building in the middle distance, which was removed in the second version. Both versions include the two <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>-like groups in the foreground, for which Degas made numerous preparatory drawings. In the sketches and the painting, we can see his lifelong fascination with bodies caught mid-motion or in gesture. The array of legs belonging to the four girls – ten instead of the expected eight – anticipate Degas’s later ballet studies and even Futurism’s proto-cinematic depiction of movement; the boys’ varied poses are not far removed from the young ballerinas and jockeys who would soon preoccupy the artist. When he attempted to ‘update’ the picture, Degas replaced the classical features of the adolescents with more contemporary faces.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his depiction of the girls and boys, Degas has subtly reversed gender conventions, perhaps to emphasise the equal status of the young Spartan women. While their taut bodies form a tight group, and one points aggressively (or perhaps beckons) towards the boys, the youths themselves are more relaxed as they stretch and lounge. One even crouches on all fours, adopting a pose Degas would later use in his pictures of women who worked as prostitutes. This pose, which hints at an animality that was also an aspect of Degas’s art, perhaps registers the artist’s awareness of contemporary theories of evolution and degeneration. Sleek classical athleticism has been replaced by a much more ambiguous depiction of these young bodies.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a simple bare room, featuring only three objects, a sofa, a full-length mirror and a picture on the wall, a young woman stands in quiet contemplation of her appearance. The austerity of the room is matched by the subdued tonality and limited, rather silvery palette, punctuated only by the reddish brown of the sofa, the model’s hair, the brown and gilt of the mirror. She wears a striped dress with an overdress of a pale grey, tied in a bow at the waist with a black fringed scarf. Her hair is piled up with one plait at the back. She holds her hands together, grasping a small red flower, the only touch of bright colour in the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Depictions of young women at their mirror were popular among the Impressionist painters, and treated by both <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">French: Manet, Edouard (1832 - 1883)</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QHK-0001-0000-0000.htm">French: Morisot, Berthe (1841 - 1895)</a>. Such images can be placed in a much longer tradition of depictions of women at their toilette, often presented in the guise of Venus, the personification of female beauty, admiring herself in a mirror, as in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Spanish: Velázquez, Diego, The Toilet of Venus (‘The Rokeby Venus’) (NG2057)</a>. Many such images play on the theme of vanity, where women, engaged in self-contemplation, even self-admiration, are observed in images which may border on the voyeuristic. Such a sense of vanity is missing from this portrayal of critical and modest self-appraisal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is probable that Gonzalès painted this in around 1869‒70, after she had left the studio of Charles Chaplin, and started as Manet’s only formal pupil. The handling is broad and generally unmodulated, with the folds on her overdress starkly rendered. Her face, lit from the right, is delicately modelled in light and shadow in shades of grey-brown, matching the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a> of the picture on the wall, perhaps a reproductive print. This subtle monochrome modelling, which appears to be unique in her own work, is reminiscent of Manet’s work from the 1860s, which would have been present in his studio at this period. The young woman is Gonzalès’s younger sister Jeanne, her constant model throughout her career, and also an artist in her own right. As opportunities for painting professional models in public spaces could be restricted for women at this period, being able to rely on family members was crucial for artists such as Gonzalès. This painting exemplifies the type of domestic subject matter which was in many ways the limit of their permitted sphere of activity. In such a studied portrayal of a single figure Gonzalès was already applying lessons learned from both Chaplin and Manet to her consummate portrayals of the quiet spirit of bourgeois life.</p></div>

In 1870 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> left his studio in rue Guyot in the west of Paris – where he had painted his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G4N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Eva Gonzalès</a></span> – and set up his studio and home close to Place Clichy and Place Pigalle. From 1872 until his death in 1883, he produced many works that show the interiors, terraces and gardens of the popular local brasseries, restaurants, cafes and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">café-concerts</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This snapshot view of cafe society is in fact one (modified) half of a larger painting. In August 1877 Manet began work on a large picture of the Brasserie de Reichshoffen. The art critic Théodore Duret relates how Manet was fascinated by the dexterity of the waitresses ‘who, while placing with one hand a glass on a table in front of a customer, were able to hold several more in the other, without spilling a drop.’ Manet asked the most skilled waitress to pose for him in his studio, which she agreed to do, but only on condition that she was accompanied by her ‘protector’, who would also require payment. He is the man in a blue smock leaning on the table as the waitress sets down a glass of beer before him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While working on the picture, Manet radically altered his plans and cut it in two, completing each half separately. The right half (this painting) shows the waitress, while the left half shows a man and two women sitting at the other side of the table. Titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">At the Café</span>, that painting is in the Reinhart Collection, Winterthur, Switzerland. Although Manet reworked each painting separately, it is still clear that they are two halves of the same picture. For example, the table on the left of this picture joins with the table on the right of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">At the Café</span>, and the shadows of the glasses and carafes continue over the join. At the very left edge of the National Gallery picture, the fingertips of the young woman who sits on the opposite side of the table in the Reinhart painting are just visible.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Manet enlarged the National Gallery picture by adding an extra strip of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> along its right side – a join runs through the man’s blue smock, roughly in line with the satin curtain in the top right corner. By adding this extra canvas, Manet brought the waitress into the centre of the composition. He then reworked the background, adding the stage, the dancer and the orchestra, which are painted in a much looser manner than the foreground figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although a picture in its own right, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Corner of a Café-Concert</span> is also a fragment. But this is appropriate for its subject, as Manet offers us just a fleeting glimpse into this world, not a panoramic view of it. In this, it has similarities with <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYT-0001-0000-0000.htm">At the Café de Châteaudun</a></span> by Degas, which also focuses on just two people. Another smaller version of this picture is also in the Musée d’Orsay, Paris, which may be a preparatory study for this one once Manet had divided the original, larger painting.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This highly important picture has justifiably been described as ‘the earliest true example of modern painting in both subject matter and technique’. Painted in 1862, it was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>’s first major painting of contemporary life in Paris, and he exhibited it along with 13 other pictures in March the following year at his first solo show at Louis Martinet’s gallery. It shows his growing interest in urban leisure, a subject that would preoccupy him for the rest of his life, as it would the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>. But it is also a group portrait of Manet and his family, friends and associates.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are in Second Empire Paris (1852–1870), looking at a wealthy and fashionable crowd that includes many artists and intellectuals. The group has an almost courtly feel and has gathered under a canopy of chestnut trees in the Tuileries Gardens, at that time an extension of Napoleon III’s palace, to listen to one of the twice-weekly concerts given there. Despite the painting’s title, the musicians are not included, and it is not clear if the concert has started. Manet himself stands at the far left of the picture holding a cane, which we might also see as a brush – the ambiguity is perhaps intentional. His body is cropped by the edge of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> and is partly obscured by the man in front of him, the animal painter Comte Albert de Balleroy, with whom Manet had shared a studio. The novelist Champfleury, a defender of the Realist movement and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Courbet</a>, stands behind and between them. Seated close by is the bearded critic, poet and sculptor Zacharie Astruc, whose portrait Manet had painted. Above him is Aurélien Scholl, the ‘journalist of the boulevards‘.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The younger of the two seated women is Madame Lesjosne, at whose salon Manet had met both the painter Frédéric Bazille and the poet and critic Charles Baudelaire (who are also in the painting). She is accompanied by the wife of the composer Jacques Offenbach. Wearing glasses and a moustache, Offenbach is seated further to the right between Manet’s brother Eugène (the top-hatted man in white trousers standing just right of centre) and the painter Charles Monginot (who is doffing his hat). An important group near the tree above Madame Lesjosne includes fellow Realist artist Henri Fantin-Latour, who looks directly at us, and the editor Baron Taylor, a promoter of Spanish art. The influential critic and proponent of art for art’s sake, Théophile Gautier, who has a full beard and wears a brown suit, leans against a tree. Seen in profile between Gautier and Fantin-Latour is Baudelaire, perhaps the greatest influence on Manet in the 1860s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In placing himself at the picture’s edge, Manet was partly taking his cue from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velázquez</a>. Manet had recently made a copy in the Louvre of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Little Cavaliers</span>, a picture at that time attributed to Velázquez, which shows an imaginary meeting of seventeenth-century Spanish artists. The painting includes two men, believed to have been Velázquez and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Murillo</a>, standing in similar positions to Manet and de Balleroy. Manet greatly admired Velázquez, an artist for whom the relation between the observer and the observed was a central theme, most notably in his masterpiece <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Las Meninas</span> (Prado, Madrid). In that painting, Velázquez places the viewer in the place of the King and Queen of Spain, whose portrait Velázquez is painting. Manet’s picture uses a similar conceit by placing us where the musicians would be.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As a gentleman-dandy standing on the fringe of the gathering, Manet is a participant in the scene but also slightly detached from it. By presenting himself in this way, he may also be identifying himself as a flâneur, a type described by Baudelaire as a solitary ’stroller’ or ‘idler’ about town, who is part of the crowd but also observes it ironically from a distance. Manet cultivated the role of flâneur, and Baudelaire was his frequent companion when he went almost daily to the Tuileries Gardens to make studies of the children and their nannies. Baudelaire argued that modern life was as heroic and worthy of painting as the ancient world, and that painting rather than literature was best suited to capturing the spectacle of the crowd. For Baudelaire, ‘Modernity is the transient, the fleeting, the contingent.’ Working at speed, the artist should capture these fleeting appearances to ‘find the eternal in the transitory’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Manet’s painting, with its focus on the look of modern life, including contemporary high fashion (both women’s and men’s), was a response to Baudelaire’s call for images of transient beauty within contemporary urban life. While crowds and concerts were often shown in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">prints</a> and watercolours by artists such as Gavarni and Guys, Manet has made this theme the subject of an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil painting</a>. But it is his technique as much as his choice of subject that is the source of his innovative modernism. Perhaps using visiting card photographs as prompts, Manet has painted the crowd with great economy and precision, distributing the figures across the picture as if in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a> but with no obvious focal point. The crowd spreads out without shape or structure into the distance and up to the side edges of the canvas, where figures are arbitrarily cropped. Only a few faces are in focus, and all are flat and lack modelling. Most, especially those beyond our immediate field of vision, are just a blur. As the writer Emile Zola noted, ‘each figure is a little patch, hardly formed.’ Manet’s technique is sketchy and allusive, and the brushwork visible. He constructed the picture as a mass of dabs and touches of colour, without half-tones or chiaroscuro, which register the discontinuous glimpses and glances through which people experienced modern life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In May 1867 Manet displayed around 50 of his paintings, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Music in the Tuileries Gardens</span>, in a pavilion near to the Universal Exhibition, which ran in Paris from April until October. The German artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adolph Menzel</a> almost certainly visited Manet’s pavilion, and three years later in Berlin exhibited his own painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Afternoon in the Tuileries Gardens</a></span>, also in the National Gallery’s collection. Menzel’s painting was an acknowledgement of Manet’s, but it offers a very different image of the crowds relaxing in the Gardens.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 19 June 1867 the Emperor of Mexico, the Austrian Archduke Ferdinand Maximilian, and two of his generals were executed by firing squad. The younger brother of the Emperor Franz Josef of Austria, the 32-year-old Maximilian had been installed as Emperor of Mexico by a French expeditionary force in April 1864. With Maximilian enthroned as a puppet ruler, Emperor Napoleon III of France had planned to subdue Mexico and make it a French colony. However, in February 1867, following the victory of Union forces in the American Civil War and facing German threats to France, Napoleon III reneged on his support for Maximilian. French troops were withdrawn from Mexico and the brief Second Mexican Empire collapsed, leaving Maximilian defenceless.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Maximilian was captured in May 1867 by nationalist and Republican forces led by the deposed former president Benito Juárez. Court-martialled and sentenced to death, Maximilian and his two faithful generals, Miguel Miramón and Tomás Mejía, were executed at Querétaro in central Mexico. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> was outraged by the fate of Maximilian, who was widely viewed as a victim of Napoleon III’s political ambition and incompetence. Although he greatly disliked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history painting</a>, the most highly valued <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre</a> at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a>, Manet decided that Maximilian’s execution, which was widely reported in France, merited artistic treatment on an epic scale.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This damaged painting is the second of four versions of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Execution of Maximilian</span> that Manet painted between 1867 and 1868. Three are large-scale pictures and one is a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">sketch</a>. He also produced a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGX-0008-0000-0000.htm">lithograph</a>, which was suppressed by the government censor in January 1869 and never published in Manet’s lifetime. An edition of 50 prints was produced in 1884 after his death. The earliest painted version, in Boston’s Museum of Fine Arts, is a largely imaginative and hastily painted study rather than a finished picture. Although the execution takes place in an open landscape and not against a wall (as in the final version), Manet’s deliberate reference to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Goya</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Third of May 1808</span> (Prado, Madrid), which he had seen in Spain two years earlier, is most apparent here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As more detailed accounts of the execution, including photographs of the victims and the firing squad, became available in France, Manet began work on a second, more authentic version – the National Gallery’s picture. He most likely abandoned this version because of discrepancies in scale: the size of General Miramón on the left, part of whose foot can also be seen in the central fragment, suggests that the Emperor and his generals are too close to the firing squad. Rather than repaint the picture, Manet began a new version. Although the National Gallery picture was never completed, its arrangement of figures was retained in the next two versions. A small, freely painted sketch (Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek, Copenhagen) – the third version – is a preparatory study for the final version (Mannheim, Kunsthalle), which was Manet’s fourth and definitive painting of the execution.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A photograph taken in 1883 of the National Gallery picture shows that the left-hand section of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>, containing the Emperor and General Mejia, had been cut away; it also shows damage elsewhere in the picture. After Manet’s death, his family cut up the canvas and sold individual fragments separately. The surviving fragments were acquired by Degas, and bought by the National Gallery in 1918 at the sale of his studio. First shown as separate pictures, the fragments were finally combined on one canvas in the late 1970s.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the summer of 1867, the German artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adolph Menzel</a> stayed in Paris for nine weeks. It was his second visit to the city and it coincided with the Universal Exhibition, which ran from April until October. While in Paris, Menzel almost certainly visited <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>’s pavilion. Manet had not been invited to participate in the official fair but, following the example of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Courbet</a> – who had set up his own ‘Pavilion of Realism’ when his monumental canvas <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Painter’s Studio</span> (Musée d’Orsay, Paris) was rejected by the 1855 Universal Exhibition – he set up his own pavilion nearby. It displayed around 50 of Manet’s paintings, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GHZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Music in the Tuileries Gardens</a></span> (1862). A pencil drawing in Menzel’s Paris sketchbook of the crowd at the Tuileries Gardens affirms that he had seen Manet’s picture and that it made a deep impression upon him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Menzel began work on his own painting of the Tuileries Gardens as soon as he returned to Berlin. Not only was it a response to Manet, but it was also the first of what was to become a series of modern urban scenes. Half the size of Manet’s picture, Menzel’s work directly quotes from it. For example, the man in a top hat seen in profile leaning forward, partly covered by a tree, replicates Manet’s brother Eugène, and in both pictures a child crouches down in the foreground. But Menzel’s picture is no copy or pastiche of Manet’s. The differences between the two are more telling than their similarities, and Menzel’s painting might be viewed as a rejection of Manet. Significantly, when first exhibited in Berlin in 1858, Menzel’s work was titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sunday Afternoon in the Tuileries Gardens, from Memory</span>, and he also added an abbreviation for Berlin after his signature to emphasise that it was not painted from life in Paris. Instead, the picture is a synthesis of vignettes or impressions, perhaps based upon observation, assembled in his studio to form a single scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are important differences between the two pictures. While Manet used a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>-like composition, Menzel has created deep paths through the trees at sharp angles to the picture plane, which open up the space and also allow him to include more figures. The foreground also tilts forward slightly to offer us an aerial view across the park towards its entrance on the rue de Rivoli. Menzel ’s emphasis on illusion and depth is very different from Manet’s on the flat surface of the canvas. In contrast to Manet’s lack of modelling, Menzel has maintained an effect of atmospheric recession, as figures in the foreground are painted in minute detail and almost tip out of the picture, while those further back are painted more freely. Manet’s picture shows people drawn mainly from a single class – the Parisian haute bourgeoisie – whereas Menzel’s picturesque realism, full of busy detail and anecdote, shows a heterogeneous crowd of various ages, classes and nationalities. Seen together, the two pictures show there was more than one way to depict ‘modern life’.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the summer of 1869, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and Renoir painted together at La Grenouillère, a slightly raffish resort on the river Seine, some 12 kilometres west of Paris, not far from where Monet was living. La Grenouillère (literally, ‘The Frog Pond’) had been ‘discovered’ by artists, writers, musicians and performers about a decade earlier, and during the 1860s it became a popular weekend retreat from the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The resort was easily reached by rail (from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CYY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gare Saint-Lazare</a>, which Monet painted several times) or by coach and offered a range of leisure activities, including boating, fishing and swimming. There was also a floating restaurant (out of frame to the right of the picture) and dance hall, as well as riverside tables for drinking and dining. Attracting a wide cross-section of Parisian society, the resort was even visited by the Emperor Napoleon III, accompanied by his wife and son, during the same summer that Monet and Renoir were working there. Although some contemporaries, including the writer Maupassant, judged La Grenouillère to be a vulgar pleasure-spot populated by low-class revellers, it offered the type of modern life subject that other writers, such as Baudelaire and the Goncourt brothers, had been urging artists to engage with.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paintings Monet made at the resort were part of his project to complete a large painting of the site, which he planned to exhibit at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1870. He was initially sceptical about what he had achieved. Writing to fellow artist Frédéric Bazille on 25 September 1869 he explained: ‘I indeed have a dream, a painting of bathing at La Grenouillère, for which I have made some bad <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">sketches</a>, but it’s a dream. Renoir, who has been spending two months here, also wants to do this picture.’ Between them, Monet and Renoir produced six paintings of La Grenouillère.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The ‘bad sketches’ Monet referred to include this painting and one now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. He also painted a small study of two of the rowing boats (Kunsthalle, Berne). Another painting of La Grenouillère was rejected by the Salon of 1870 and is probably the picture, formerly in the Arnhold Collection in Berlin but destroyed during Second World War, known only from a photograph. That photograph shows a more finished composition that was painted on a slightly larger <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>. Wider in format than the National Gallery and Metropolitan Museum sketches, the Salon picture combined elements from both and included other details such as sailing boats and a crowd of fashionable visitors. Extending beyond the right-hand edge of the National Gallery’s picture, it showed the pontoon footbridge leading to a small circular island (nicknamed ‘the Camembert’) and, beyond that, the floating restaurant. These are included in the New York painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Monet had been regularly painting outdoors, his letter to Bazille indicates that he made a distinction between a sketch (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">pochade</span>) completed rapidly on site and a finished picture (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">tableau</span>), possibly for exhibition, that had been worked up in a studio. Although the two La Grenouillère sketches were painted quickly and are technically quite crude, they have a directness and immediacy that could not be achieved in the studio. In both pictures, Monet was painting what he saw, without any attempt to tidy up the scene. Close examination of the National Gallery picture reveals that he probably painted on a used canvas and that parts of the picture were hurriedly reworked. The spontaneity of his method is evident, too, in his rejection of traditional methods of creating the illusion of three-dimensional space through linear perspective and conventional compositional devices. For example, he has not used a framing device (such as receding lines of trees or foliage) to create an effect of spatial recession. There is no central point or object of focus, and the horizon is placed close to the top of the picture. Although the lines of the boats do lead our eye along the bend of the river, any smooth access into the picture is interrupted by the horizontal line of the footbridge, which cuts across the canvas, effectively bisecting it, and by the vertical figures walking along it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both the bridge and the figures draw attention to the picture as a flat design, an emphasis that is amplified by the handling of the paint. Monet avoids conventional painterly modelling of forms in the round through light and shade, instead using swift, sketchy notation. He has indicated the shapes of the boats with thick lines of paint, rather than delineating them in detail. Broad strokes block in figures, foliage and bands of light reflected on the water, much of which is, unusually, in shadow. Some areas, including the trees, appear unfinished; details elsewhere, such as the bathers in the river, are captured with just dabs of paint. Even the larger figures, including the almost crudely caricatural depiction of the two women in bathing costumes and the man on the walkway, are rendered with just a few swift strokes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two technical innovations contributed to Monet’s painting method. The advent of soft metal tubes of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> ready for immediate use made painting outdoors much easier, and the introduction of a metal ferrule for paintbrushes led to the production of flat, rather than round, brushes. These new brushes enabled a new type of brushstroke – a broad, flat and evenly painted patch of colour. Monet created his painting though multiple coloured patches which, together with his limited range of strong colours, give the painting a decorative unity. His marks on the canvas are not literal transcriptions of the scene that was before him but are instead equivalences – in paint – of what he was observing.  Rather than a documentary record of La Grenouillère, Monet presents a summary of his own experience of fleeting visual effects or impressions that changed moment to moment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet may initially have been dissatisfied with his ‘bad sketches’ at La Grenouillère, but these impressions were nonetheless pictures in their own right and not merely steps towards a ‘finished’ painting. In painting a scene of contemporary urban leisure in a distinctly new way, Monet was moving towards a way of painting soon to be known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Snow scenes were a particular favourite among the Impressionists, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> painted several canvases that explore the way sunlight plays upon the snow, reflecting tones of red, pink, purple and blue at different times of day. In 1875, for example, he had painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0J1X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Snow Scene at Argenteuil</a></span>, setting his snowy scene in the Paris suburb where he was living at the time. This scene of Lavacourt was produced a few years later, when he was living at Vétheuil, about 60 kilometres further north. It shows a tiny hamlet on a bend in the Seine on the opposite bank of the river to his home.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet had left Argenteuil in April 1878 and moved to Vétheuil during a period of great financial hardship: the market for his paintings was proving sluggish, and at Vétheuil he was able to share  a modest house with his former patrons, the Hoschedés, who had also fallen on hard times. Away from the distractions of Paris and isolated from his fellow artists, he began to draw subjects and inspiration from his new rural environment.  He abandoned cityscapes to devote himself to landscape, frequently working out of doors, no doubt partly to escape from his cramped home which lacked a studio. It was here that he started painting in series, observing the same motif in different seasons and weather conditions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture is dated 1881, but it was probably painted earlier: Monet sometimes added a signature and an inaccurate date long after the picture was painted. It may date to the winter of 1879/80, which was unusually cold. The Seine froze over and Monet was captivated by the way the landscape was transformed by snow and ice, braving the freezing temperatures to set up his easel outside. This painting is one of a group of similar views looking upstream with the tumbledown cottages of Lavacourt on the right. In contrast to the explicit modernity of his views of Paris and its suburbs, it presents a traditional rural world untouched by industry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is simple but tightly structured. The strong diagonal formed by the houses and the line of trees guides our eyes over the green waters of the Seine and across to the opposite side of the river. The great bank of snow in the foreground is conveyed with broad sweeps of the brush, the whites overlain with blues that become darker in the middle distance and which are reflected in the roofs of the houses. The cold blue and grey tones suggest that this side of the river is in shadow, unlike the opposite side, where pink tones suggest the warmth of pale sunlight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1905, the critic Frank Rutter launched a French Impressionist Fund Committee, which aimed to buy an Impressionist painting for the nation and present it to the National Gallery. This was the painting that was suggested, but it was evidently too avant-garde for the Gallery’s trustees. The Committee was warned that ‘Boudin was the furthest limit to which the National Gallery was prepared to go’, and Boudin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Entrance to Trouville Harbour</a></span> was bought instead. Monet’s picture was bought by the collector and dealer Hugh Lane, ironically ending up at the National Gallery as part of his bequest in 1917.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1871 Monet moved with his family to Argenteuil, a suburb north-west of Paris that was connected to the capital by a 15-minute train journey. During his six-year stay there he painted around 200 pictures of the town and its surroundings. He depicted the ordinary streets, the road bridge, the railway bridge with stream trains puffing across it, river walks and smart villas. The rapidly expanding suburb was known as a popular destination for summer day trips and pleasure boating, but it was not an untouched rural idyll as it also had factories, an ironworks and a brick works that brought wealth to the area.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture is one of 18 Argenteuil canvases that record the snowy winter of 1874/5.  It shows the Boulevard Saint-Denis, near Monet’s home, looking towards its junction with the rue de la Voie des Bans, with the Seine beyond. As he worked,  Monet would have had his back to the railway station which brought pleasure trippers and commuters to and from Paris. The figures trudging along the road may be making their way to or from the trains, the snow halting their progress to a snail’s pace, while wavy brown cart tracks snake into the distance, drawing our eye towards the horizon, where distant buildings seem to dissolve in the mist. The snow and fog mask the fact that this is a thoroughly modern suburb, where the road is lined with houses that had been built quite recently.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is the largest of the Argenteuil snow scenes; when Monet worked on a larger scale he was often more interested in achieving a generalised effect than in portraying individual elements. So while some of the smaller snow scenes painted that year are more richly detailed and full of anecdote, this painting focuses instead on atmosphere. It is an overcast afternoon and the sun is slowly fading from the sky. The palette is almost monochromatic, the whites, blues and greys warmed with pink tones. Occasional touches of stronger colour distributed across the canvas serve to bind the composition together. Dabs of red in the trees on the left are repeated in the cart tracks in the middle and the trees on the right. The blue of the central figure is also repeated in the windows of the church, the tracks and the trees. Monet would have brushed in the ground and sky before delineating the tree branches and the cart tracks with spare calligraphic strokes. The paint on the road in the foreground is thicker than elsewhere in the picture, perhaps because Monet was trying to suggest the physical presence of deep snow.</p></div>

But this painting and the eight others he made in the summer of 1870 show it as a holiday destination, with wide sandy beaches, bracing air and impressive seaside architecture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet painted it during the weeks he spent at Trouville following his marriage, with his new wife Camille and their son Jean. Monet’s fellow painter and friend <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eugène Boudin</a> was also spending the summer at Trouville, and the two men sometimes painted side-by-side in the open air. During his stay Monet produced four large canvases – one view of the harbour and three paintings of the seafront lined with smart hotels – as well as five smaller pictures of figures on the beach, of which this is one. The smaller pictures may have been made as studies for larger paintings that were never realised, but the fact that this one is signed with Monet’s initials might indicate that he saw it as complete in itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Camille posed for most of the beach scenes. Here she is shown relaxing with a woman who has been variously identified as Madame Boudin, Camille’s sister or a member of Monet’s family. The composition is daring and innovative; where Boudin’s Trouville scenes (such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Beach Scene, Trouville</a></span>) depict lines of fashionably dressed figures on the beach seen from a  distance, Monet shows the two women in close-up, their figures apparently casually arranged and cropped by the picture frame, rather like a snapshot.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Grains of sand  blown by the sea breeze onto the canvas that became embedded in the wet paint reveal that it was painted at least partly on the spot. Colours are mainly limited to tones of yellow, grey, blue and black. Facial features and costume details are dashed in briefly with flat strokes of paint: the main focus here is on the play of light and shade. The bright sunlight is conveyed in bold strokes of brilliant white, and the women shade their faces with parasols. It is possible that Camille is wearing a veil to protect her skin. In her pale summer dress and flowery hat, she seems lost in thought, while her companion, dressed in contrasting black, seems intent on reading her newspaper. A child’s shoe hooked on the back of the chair may belong to the three-year-old Jean. Distant figures, a tent and other features are sketched in with a few strokes of the brush. The flag on the flagpole and the scudding clouds tell us that despite the dazzling sunlight this is a breezy day.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture may appear to sum up the carefree atmosphere of a summer holiday, but life for the Monet family was far from carefree at the time. France had just declared war on Prussia, and the future must have looked very uncertain. At the end of the summer season Monet sailed for England to escape the fighting in Paris, but only after a delay because he had been unable to pay the bill for his Trouville hotel.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Trains appeared in several of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>’s pictures from 1870 onward, but the paintings he made of the Gare Saint-Lazare are his most extensive exploration of railways as a subject. This work is one of a dozen views of the Gare Saint-Lazare that Monet painted in early 1877, after he was granted permission in January to paint the station and its approaches. He had known the station since childhood as it was the Paris terminal for trains to Normandy, where he grew up. It also served trains to many of the key <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionist</a> sites west of Paris, including Bougival and Argenteuil, where he had previously lived. In late 1871 Monet had also rented a small apartment just a single block from the station’s main entrance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The station had opened in 1837. It was enlarged 1851–3, following designs by Eugène Flachat, and extended again 1867–8. This expansion was in response to the demand for rapid transport links across France and to the dramatic growth of Paris itself; by 1870, the Gare Saint-Lazare was handling around 11 million suburban passengers every year. The station was an obvious example of the city’s newly built structures and had already been painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Railway</span> of 1873 (National Gallery of Art, Washington). Monet’s friend Gustave Caillebotte was also working on paintings of the Quartier de l’Europe around the Gare Saint-Lazare, perhaps prompting Monet to tackle a similar subject. Caillebotte’s paintings include <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Pont de l’Europe</span> (Museé du Petit Palais, Geneva), a view of the recently built bridge over the station’s rail tracks. Painted in 1876, it was exhibited in the third Impressionist group show in May 1877. Trains were viewed as emblems of modernity both within France and elsewhere. During his stay in London in 1870–1, for example, Monet would have seen Turner’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CV2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rain, Steam and Speed</a></span> at the National Gallery, in which a fiery locomotive hurtles across a rainswept bridge as a hare on the track leaps from its path.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet produced his 12 pictures of the Gare Saint-Lazare during a period of intense activity from January to March 1877. Seven of them were listed among the 30 pictures he submitted to the Impressionist group show in May, although it may be that only six were hung. It is not known whether the National Gallery’s picture was among those exhibited. The pictures display a range of techniques and compositions, and differ both in subject and in their degree of finish. While two of the group are highly finished, others are closer to rapidly executed sketches (or esquisses). Describing the pictures on display at the 1877 Impressionist show, the critic Georges Rivière noted, ‘these paintings are amazingly varied, despite the monotony and aridity of the subject. In them more than anywhere else we can see that skill in arrangement, that organisation of the canvas, that is one of the main qualities of Monet’s work.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the less finished paintings of the group, the National Gallery’s picture is also the most freely painted of the four Monet made within the station itself. He positioned himself at the terminus of one of the main lines, looking across the platforms towards the Pont de l’Europe – the low grey oblong in the middle distance. In the foreground, we can see two locomotives swathed in steam and surrounded by passengers probably waiting to board. Further back on the left, the train under the bridge is barely visible in a cloud of smoke. Although this is a scene of industry and mechanisation, Monet was primarily concerned with the effects of light and atmosphere within the station’s vast interior space, which is covered by a glass roof supported by girders that could span 40 metres. Monet has placed the apex of the roof near the top of the picture, with the three arches of the parcel depot to the right. The dark and dramatic angular line of the roof contrasts with the random patterns formed by the steam, just as the rigid metal of the girders is the material opposite of the translucent steam and smoke. By including the closed roof at the top of the picture, Monet has also turned the conventions of landscape upside down – the light and cloud normally associated with an open sky are now indoors, contained within a distinctly modern and engineered structure made of glass and iron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the painting looks as though it was completed in a single sitting, at least three separate stages can be identified. Monet first set out the principal framework of the composition, particularly the architecture and the position of the trains. He completed the bulk of the painting during the second stage. Working quickly using wispy, almost calligraphic brushstrokes, he established the principal components of the picture. He has employed a sophisticated method of colour construction throughout, his method providing an insight into Impressionist colour techniques. For example, despite the dark colours used in much of the picture, such as the almost black locomotives and station canopy, pure black <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> is very rarely present, and earth tones are entirely absent. Instead, Monet created dark or subdued hues by mixing vivid pigments, which he modulated by altering the mix. The dark purple tones of the station canopy were achieved by using substantial amounts of red lake, but the amount of blue was increased when Monet needed to indicate greenish-blue shadow. These blue pigments were all nineteenth-century creations. White was used throughout where lighter tones were needed, and some sections, such as areas of steam and smoke and the patch of sky, were painted almost entirely with pure lead white.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Having painted most of the picture, Monet returned to it later to add a few final and sparing touches of pure colour on top of the partly dried paint. These touches, such as dabs of pure bright red vermilion on some of the passengers and cobalt blue highlights on the locomotives, are the only instances of unmixed pigment in the painting.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet was captivated by London’s fog during his first stay in the capital from 1870 to 1871. Later in life he told the art dealer Rene Gimpel: ‘Without the fog, London would not be a beautiful city.

The Houses of Parliament had only just been finished, as had the Victoria Embankment on the right. St Thomas’ Hospital, the low rectangular shape on the far left, was also nearing completion before opening in the summer of 1871, and Westminster Bridge had been reconstructed in 1862. However, Monet is more interested here in broad effects than architectural detail; indeed he has exaggerated the height of the towers of the Houses of Parliament, making the building seem like a fairy tale palace.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> arrived in London in September 1870, fleeing from the Franco-Prussian War and the Paris Commune, and stayed until May 1871. While in the capital he painted five cityscapes: two views of parks, two of the Pool of London (the stretch of the Thames between London Bridge and Limehouse) and this evocation of the Thames looking south towards the Houses of Parliament. He was captivated by the London fog, later telling the art dealer Rene Gimpel: ‘Without the fog, London would not be a beautiful city. It’s the fog that gives it its magnificent breadth. Its regular, massive blocks become grandiose in this mysterious cloak.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The fog was, of course, largely the result of industrial pollution, and Monet has successfully conveyed the griminess of the city through the subtle play of greys and browns, with pinkish tones in the sky hinting at sunlight behind the mist. Carefully positioned horizontal and vertical structures – the jetty in the foreground, Westminster Bridge on the horizon and the Houses of Parliament – anchor the misty composition. To convey the luminous haziness of the sky Monet employed a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQN-0008-0000-0000.htm">scumbling</a> technique, using long brushstrokes that contrast with the broken brushstrokes that suggest the choppiness of the waves and reflections in the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, this is more than a tonal study – it is also painting about modernity. Tugboats chugging along the Thames underline the fact that this is a working river that plays an essential role in the city’s commercial life. Every architectural element was new at the time. Westminster Bridge had been rebuilt in 1862. The construction of the Houses of Parliament had only just been finished, as had that of the Victoria Embankment on the right – the workers on the jetty are dismantling scaffolding that had been used during the building work. The creation of embankments along the Thames and the accompanying new drainage and sewerage system had transformed the riverside. The Thames was now a grand waterway like the Seine in Paris, instead of an open sewer approached by narrow alleyways. St Thomas’ Hospital, the low rectangular shape on the far left, was also nearing completion before opening in the summer of 1871. However, Monet is more interested here in broad effects than architectural detail; indeed, he has exaggerated the height of the towers of the Houses of Parliament, making the building seem even more of a fairy tale palace than it is in real life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While he was in London, Monet may have seen the American artist James Abbott McNeill Whistler’s first <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Nocturne</span> paintings, which convey the beauty and tranquillity of the Thames at night. But unlike Whistler, Monet did not paint the Thames by moonlight, nor did he paint largely from memory. Monet’s river scene also feels tangible and substantial; it may be viewed through haze, but there is a sense of solidity to the stone and wooden structures that is very different from the dissolving forms in Whistler’s paintings. In this respect Monet’s picture is more akin to the work of Daubigny, his fellow exile in London. Daubigny’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GAU-0001-0000-0000.htm">St Paul’s from the Surrey Side</a></span>, a view of the river looking in the opposite direction, conveys a similar impression of the Thames in the mist, emphasising the industry along the river, with steam rising from chimneys.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the only view Monet painted of the Houses of Parliament during his first London trip, but he returned to the subject almost three decades later, painting a series of views of it bathed in mist at different times of day from the vantage point of St Thomas’ Hospital.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of 12 surviving pictures that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Camille Pissarro</a> painted while in self-imposed exile in London from late 1870 to mid-1871 during the Franco-Prussian war. When the Prussians invaded Paris in September 1870 and commandeered his house in Louveciennes, to the west of the city, Pissarro and his family moved to London, where his mother and brother were already living.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">They arrived in early December 1870 and settled briefly in the south London village known then as Lower Norwood, before moving to Upper Norwood (the two parts merged 15 years later). This area of south London was undergoing significant change, as villages and the surrounding countryside were absorbed into the spreading suburbs. All the paintings show places within walking distance of Pissarro’s lodgings, but reveal different aspects of the city. Another painting in the National Gallery’s collection <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM2-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Avenue, Sydenham</a></span>, shows an elegant residential street, while <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lordship Lane Station, Dulwich</span> (Courtauld Institute, London) focuses on the city’s technological modernisation, specifically the railway.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The winter of 1870–1 was particularly cold, enabling Pissarro to continue painting the type of winter landscapes he had produced in France in the winter of 1868–9. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fox Hill, Upper Norwood</span> is perhaps the first picture he painted in London. One of the more rural scenes of the group, it is particularly close to landscapes he had been painting at Louveciennes, especially his views of the Versailles Road, which he painted in different weather conditions between 1869 and 1870. As in the Versailles Road pictures, we see a simple road flanked by houses, chimney smoke merging with the clouds. Three people – two women and a man in a top hat with a walking stick – pass each other, their sombre clothing matching the shrubbery and bare trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture has the appearance of having been painted quickly on site, with Pissarro’s easel placed in the centre of the gently winding road as he looked up and westward towards Fox Hill. However, it was completed in several stages. Having first sketched out the basic outlines of the composition, Pissarro worked rapidly and energetically using a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> technique to blend the colours and block out specific areas, such as the foliage. Some details – including the man – were only added once the initial paint layers had dried. Although Pissarro used a broad array of colours, there is a strong tonal contrast between the darker houses and foliage in the lower half of the picture and the bright sky of the upper half. In places, Pissarro used touches of vivid colour, which also bind the composition together. For example, the russet red in the women’s clothing is echoed in the rooftop of the house facing us, and the pale blue of the shadows on the snow echoes the blue sky.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible to identify the site today – the road at Fox Hill retains its slight bend – but Pissarro was perhaps more interested in the atmospheric effects of light and weather than in precise topography. Indeed, this painting may have been exhibited with the title <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Effet de neige</span> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Snow Effect</span>), rather than a title indicating a specific location, in March 1871 at the New Bond Street gallery of art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel. He was an important champion of the Impressionists, who Pissarro first met on this visit to London.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of 12 pictures that Pissarro painted while in self-imposed exile in London from 1870 to 1871 during the Franco-Prussian war.

This picture is one of 12 he painted while in self-imposed exile there. One of the largest paintings in the group, this springtime scene, with the trees just coming into leaf, would have been completed in April or May 1871, shortly before Pissarro’s return to France. Another London painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fox Hill, Upper Norwood</a></span>, is also in the National Gallery’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The view here is of The Avenue, a wide, tree-lined street in Sydenham, a fashionable semi-rural suburb near Crystal Palace in south London. This is not a scene of working life; instead, we see elegantly dressed people enjoying leisurely walks or rides along a picturesque residential street. The location can be identified today as Lawrie Park Avenue with the church of Saint Bartholomew, built in 1832, in the distance. Pissarro slightly narrowed and elongated the church’s tower and also reduced the number of dark windows to create a less solid effect. He had often experimented with the traditional landscape motif of a receding path or lane, but he may also have been influenced by Hobbema’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Avenue at Middelharnis</a></span>, with its long avenue of tall trees, which was on display at the National Gallery in May 1871.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Avenue</span> seems typical of the plein-air (painted outdoors) method that was favoured by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>, this is not how it was produced. Pissarro initially made a preparatory watercolour study (now in the Louvre, Paris), and the painting itself was completed in two distinct stages. First, following a preliminary drawing of the view, he blocked out the main sections with areas of colour which did not quite touch. He then used <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> brushwork to unify the composition and add detail. Unlike the greys and browns in many of his previous paintings, Pissarro used bright blues and greens. With the exception of the sky, he also mixed much of the paint with white to reduce the colour contrasts and create a consistent light tonality throughout – a technique also used by Corot. The figures were added last with small delicate touches of paint. Even at a very late stage, Pissarro made changes – for example, a solitary woman walking towards us on the right-hand pavement (who was in the original watercolour sketch) was painted out and replaced by a small group of figures in front of the church. If you look closely, you can see a trace of her just to the left of the group.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While in London, Pissarro met the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who bought four pictures, including this one. Pissarro was keen to sell his work in England, and this painting’s traditional use of perspective, degree of finish and appealing motif were perhaps intended to be acceptable to English buyers. Durand-Ruel also put Pissarro in touch with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>, who had likewise left France for the safety of London. Pissarro later recalled, ‘Monet and I were very enthusiastic over the London landscapes… Monet worked in the parks, whilst I, living in Lower Norwood, at that time a charming suburb, studied the effect of fog, snow and springtime’. Nineteen years later, Pissarro said of the painting, ‘there is a striving for unity in it that fills me with joy’.</p></div>

Instead, we are looking at a road called the route de la Princesse, which ran from the train station at Bougival (where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> was living) to Pissarro’s house in Louveciennes. The group of houses in the middle of the painting is the neighbouring village of Voisins. Part of the Marly aqueduct can be seen against the sky on the left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pissarro has arranged the scene as a series of layered bands, with the road and a row of bushes or vines in the foreground and, in the distance, the hills and aqueduct. The gentle rise and fall of the landscape recalls paintings by Corot, who Pissarro had met and whose paintings he had closely studied, as does the plain country road along which several local residents are travelling. Closest to us is a peasant woman wearing a white bonnet; furthest back is a man driving a simple wagon pulled by a donkey or mule. Pissarro has kept all four figures in the middle and far distance, their features undefined, so they do not distract us from the overall composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Corot’s influence can also be seen in the painting’s soft tones and range of colours, particularly its earthy browns and the warm yellow-ochre for the road. Here, Pissarro has followed Corot’s advice to pay attention to a painting’s ‘values’ (Corot’s term for the tonal relationships within it). However, Pissarro’s looser brushwork is more pronounced than that of Corot, who was critical of Impressionism – for example, where he builds up structure with small strokes and dabs of paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Renoir painted the same view a few months later (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). But whereas Pissarro presents an agricultural scene populated by rural people, Renoir’s landscape is more untamed. He also included a well-dressed bourgeois family who pass by a peasant wearing traditional blue clothing, to create an image of a middle-class stroll in the countryside rather than a working landscape.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We seem to be sitting in a box at the theatre, which we share with two young women. But we can’t be sure what is going on. We can’t see the stage and we have only a very partial view of the audience. One woman is looking away from us and the back of her bonnet hides most of the other’s face, so we can’t gauge their expressions clearly or make a reliable judgement as to how old they are. Nor can we tell what they are looking at.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This sense of mystery – of a hidden narrative – is enhanced by the fact that the nearer of the two women is sitting very upright and leaning forward slightly, as though something is absorbing her attention. This is hardly surprising given the occasion, but it may not be the stage performance which has captured her eye. In nineteenth-century Paris, attending the theatre was as much about social status as it was about watching the show – seeing who was there, what they were wearing and with whom they were associating.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The grand staircase in the foyer of the Palais Garnier opera house, which had opened only a year or two before this painting was made, was built with a series of balconies on either side – vantage points to view those arriving at the theatre. The auditorium itself, like many others in the city, was designed with boxes that faced more towards the rest of the audience than towards the stage: the occupants were on display as much as the performers. Renoir was clearly conscious of this tension. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Loge</span> (Courtauld Institute, London), his other famous painting of a theatre box, one of the occupants is depicted using his opera glasses not to focus on the stage but to scan the audience around him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We get a strong sense of an atmosphere of people-watching in this picture too. Among the loosely sketched audience in the background, Renoir has made two figures – a man in the lower tier and a woman in the tier above him – stand out. They seem to have their eyes turned, either on us or, we might think, on the young woman in the box. He also made changes to the composition to increase the focus on her. X-radiography shows that he painted over two additional figures who were seated in the front of the box.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Renoir did not give this painting its current title  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Première Sortie</span> (‘the first outing’) so it is not a reliable guide to how we should interpret it. This title was first used in 1923, when the picture was sold in a London auction. This was after Renoir’s death and nearly 50 years after the picture was made. The title was probably applied to make the painting more marketable and seems to stem from the perceived youth of the woman in black, the apparent excitement suggested by her posture and the fact that she clasps a bunch of flowers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Before 1923 the painting had been referred to more neutrally as ‘Au Théâtre’ (’At the Theatre‘) and also ’Le Café-Concert’, which is strange as the setting is much grander than the sort of venue where café concerts, which were such a popular entertainment at the time, were held. There is no evidence that any of these was used by Renoir, who often gave his paintings no titles at all.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are probably looking at the river Seine near Chatou (some ten miles west of central Paris), although the exact site has not been identified. However, it is likely that Renoir was more interested in creating a generalised image of a summer’s day on the river than in producing an accurate topographical record. Although routinely dated to 1879–80, the picture was probably executed in 1875, the same year Renoir painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Luncheon at La Fournaise</span> (Art Institute of Chicago), which has similar soft feathery brushstrokes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like Berthe Morisot’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D8Y-0001-0000-0000.htm">Summer’s Day</a></span>, painted a few years later, Renoir’s serene and sunlit picture of city-dwellers relaxing on the outskirts of Paris is typical of imagery that has come to characterise <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>. Boating was a popular subject for the Impressionists, and Renoir includes familiar Impressionist motifs such as the rowing boat itself (in fact, a skiff or small gig), a sailboat, a riverside villa, and a railway bridge (perhaps also a discrete reference to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>’s interest in railways). The arrival of a steam train from Paris in the background underlines the easy access to the countryside.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If Renoir’s choice of subject is typically Impressionist, his painting technique – especially his use of colour – is perhaps even more so and is also central to his aim at this time of producing ‘modern’ pictures painted with recently introduced <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a>. The picture, despite its appearance of spontaneity, evolved through distinct stages. Renoir conveys the shimmering play of light, particularly upon the water, by laying down a dense mesh of strokes, which are clearly distinct in the foreground and mid-distance but softer for the trees in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in Morisot’s painting, the distant treeline and thin band of sky are very close to the top of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>. This draws our attention to the surface of the canvas itself and undercuts traditional techniques of atmospheric recession into space. Instead, structure is created by a series of horizontals – notably, the boat and the river bank – which are offset by various features placed near the picture’s edges – for example, the white sail of the sailboat (whose hull repeats the red-orange of the rowing boat), the clump of reeds in the lower left corner, and the patch of sunlight under the bridge. The woman on the left, positioned almost dead centre and whose presence is emphasised by the diagonal line of the oar, functions as a linchpin for the whole composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Renoir roughly primed most of the canvas with white paint (the original pale brown canvas is clearly visible around the edges) to help create a light tone throughout, but the intensity of colour is achieved mainly by his juxtaposing areas of bright unmixed paint used directly from the tube. Many of these pigments had only recently become available and Renoir limits himself to lead white and seven other strong colours. He makes no use of black or of earth tones. Above all, the painting is dominated by the strong contrast between the orange of the boat (and its reflection) and the blues of the water. According to the colour theory developed in 1839 by the French chemist Michel Eugène Chevreul, blue and orange are  complementary colours, and when placed next to each other the intensity of each is enhanced.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting places us in a busy street in Paris close to six principal figures who fill the foreground. A milling crowd behind them almost completely blocks out the boulevard beyond. The top quarter of the picture is mostly filled by a canopy of at least a dozen umbrellas. The picture was the last of Renoir’s large-scale vertical paintings of modern life before he turned to more traditional and less obviously contemporary subjects such as landscapes, nudes and portraits. It is also significant because both its composition and its painting method already point to a shift in Renoir’s art which took place during the 1880s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By the time he came to paint <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Umbrellas</span>, Renoir was gaining recognition from a small circle of patrons and collectors. But he was also beginning to reassess his art and its relation to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>. As he later commented to the art dealer Ambroise Vollard: ‘I had come to the end of Impressionism, and was reaching the conclusion that I didn’t know how either to paint or draw. In a word, I was at a dead end.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like other Impressionist artists, Renoir had worked by applying rapid touches of bright, often unblended colour to create luminous shimmering surfaces. This method was particularly suited to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFY-0008-0000-0000.htm">plein air</a> landscapes, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CMA-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Skiff</a></span>, but he was also searching for more structure and clarity of form. In this, he sought the ‘instruction of the museums’, developing a particular  admiration for Ingres, especially his drawings. During a trip to Italy from 1881 to 1882 he was inspired by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> in the Villa Farnesina, Rome, and by ancient Roman wall paintings in Naples. He believed that classical art had a ‘purity and grandeur’ that was lacking in his own work, and this perception was perhaps reinforced during a long stay with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a> in Provence on his return journey. Not only was <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Umbrellas</span> painted during this period of artistic re-evaluation, but it was produced in two stages with a gap of around four years between the first stage (most likely 1880–1) and the second (1884–5). Having put the picture aside, Renoir was prompted to complete it when it was to be included in a major exhibition of Impressionist painting due to open in New York in April 1886.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Umbrellas</span> is a painting of two distinct styles. During the first stage he worked on it, Renoir painted the group on the right that includes a mother and her two daughters and the woman in profile in the centre who looks up as she opens her umbrella. These people, who are presented side-on, are painted in a characteristically Impressionist manner. Renoir uses delicate feathery touches of rich luminous tones of blue, green and orange, which evoke the sheen of velvet and the textures of feathers and lace. Their soft facial features are not clearly modelled and Renoir avoids crisp contours or outlines.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The people on the left of the painting, including the full-length young woman – a milliner’s assistant holding a bandbox – and the man standing behind her were originally painted using the feathery technique. At this first stage, the milliner’s assistant was also wearing a hat. Renoir then repainted the group during the second stage of the picture’s evolution, abandoning the soft technique for a more linear style. These figures now have clearly defined outlines and precisely drawn features. Renoir’s attention to Ingres is also evident, perhaps, in the flowing outlines of the young woman’s head and torso. The brushwork on this side of the canvas is more even and uniform and helps create a sense of three-dimensional form. The long grey-blue dress of the woman on the left (with its echoes of Cezanne) is also much more structured. Its folds and lines are more clearly described than the blue dresses of the women at the centre, which almost merge into each other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Changes in women’s fashion also provide clear evidence of the four-year interval in completing the picture. The figures on the right wear expensive clothes which came into vogue around 1881 and remained fashionable the following year. However, the dress of the young woman on the left, which is quite different in cut with more severe lines, only came into fashion around 1885. Like Ingres’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D8J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Madame Moitessier</a></span>, Renoir’s women wear the latest fashions – indeed, a lithograph of his painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">On the Terrace</span> was used to illustrate a fashion magazine in 1882. Close technical examination of the picture, including X-rays, has provided further evidence about the stylistic differences between the picture’s two halves. Not only is the underpainting of the two groups completely dissimilar, but their paint surfaces were also built up in quite distinct ways. The figures on the right were initially only very loosely indicated before being gradually refined. However, the figures and forms on the left were clearly defined from the start, and Renoir also made a number of alterations as the work progressed. He even changed his choice of paint for the picture, replacing chrome yellow and cobalt blue (his preferred pigments from the mid-1870s) with Naples yellow and French ultramarine, which produced the distinctive slate-grey tones that are particularly visible in the umbrellas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We can only speculate as to why Renoir did not resolve the discrepancies in the picture before exhibiting it, as these would have been apparent to contemporary viewers and would have also adversely affected its saleability. He did eventually sell it to Durand-Ruel in 1892 for a very modest price for a picture of this size. Perhaps he believed each group was successful in its own right, but he more likely thought that the painting – particularly the group on the right – was a throwback to the compositions he had moved away from following his trip to Italy. Although Renoir may have left the picture unresolved, it provides a fascinating insight into how he rethought his working methods.</p></div>

The watering place in the foreground of the picture was one of the last remnants of the château’s grand water gardens. Sisley lived very close by and painted almost 20 pictures that include it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He very probably worked on the picture outdoors in one sitting: it looks as though it was painted quickly using a limited range of colours.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfred Sisley</a> painted this winter scene in the small village of Marly-le-Roi in early 1875, soon after he moved there. Around 18 kilometres west of the centre of Paris, Marly-le-Roi was the site of the Château de Marly, which had been built for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TPJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Louis XIV, King of France</a>, in the late seventeenth century. Intended to be a retreat from the more formal court at Versailles, the château was known for its grand water gardens, which included fountains, cascades and a series of terraced pools that reflected the royal buildings. The gardens were maintained by water pumped from the Seine via an aqueduct which filled reservoirs in the park at Marly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the château was demolished after the Revolution in 1789, traces of the area’s royal history remained. Since the beginning of the 1870s, Sisley had been interested in sites with vestiges of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ancien Régime</span> (‘old regime’) of pre-Revolutionary France. Several of his paintings around Marly-le-Roi included the pumping station (restored in the 1850s) and remains of the aqueduct. In Marly itself, he often painted the watering place for horses, one of the last remnants of the royal water garden, which functioned as an overflow at the edge of the park. Sisley’s house was very close by, and during the two years he lived in the village he painted almost 20 pictures that show this watering place, including several snow scenes from 1875. These paintings might be regarded as an informal series, as Sisley focused on the same subject seen from different viewpoints and under different conditions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this picture we are looking southeast from the place de l’Abreuvoir, close to Sisley’s house at 2 avenue de l'Abreuvoir. The watering place is in the foreground, its surface frozen except for a dark area to the right where water pours in from an outlet. Just beyond the pool is the buttressed boundary wall of the park on the left and an unpaved road heading south up the hill to Louveciennes. The road gives a strong vertical emphasis to the picture and counterbalances the horizontals of the pool and stone wall. The pool itself is just one element of the picture, and Sisley is equally interested in the sky, the trees and the small houses that fill the landscape on the left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sisley very probably worked on the picture in one sitting: it looks as though it was painted rapidly. In many areas, the buff brown of the undercoat (<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>) can still be seen. The paint itself has been applied thinly and the swift, almost rough, brushwork is clearly visible, particularly in the foreground. Having sketched in the composition using dark paint, Sisley built up the scene with lighter tones using only a limited range of colours, including a mauve-tinted blue and chrome yellow, as well as black and white. Detail has been added with further reworking directly into the wet paint. Tiny marks in the top left corner left by canvas pins used to separate wet paintings suggest the picture was painted outdoors and then carried home. A few colour highlights – such as the dab of violet above the waterpump – were added once the paint had dried.</p></div>

The brilliant, angled sunlight beating down on the two standing figures allows Sorolla to revel in depicting both full sun and deep shade. The stark white of the bending man’s shirt rhymes with the colour of the seafoam and cresting waves while the other man and his creel appear, like the bow of the boat behind, in dark-toned shadow.

Painted by the fashionable artist Jacques Joseph (James) Tissot, a French émigré who settled in London in 1871, it depicts the art dealer Algernon Moses Marsden (1847–1920). A member of a wealthy Jewish family of clothing retailers, in 1872 Algernon Marsden established himself as an art dealer. For a short period, his gallery featured the work of successful painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P58-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Constable</a> (1776–1837), <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0R0K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giuseppe de Nittis</a> (1846–1884) and Tissot, along with other lesser-known artists. A gambler and bon viveur, Marsden faced bankruptcy three times before fleeing to the United States in 1901, abandoning his wife and 10 children. Tissot’s portrait captures him at height of his fame. Marsden, then aged 30, sits nonchalantly in a leather armchair covered by a tiger-skin rug – an element of exoticism echoed in the Chinese and Japanese ceramics in the background. He leans his head on his left hand while holding a cigar in his right, his gaze directed at the viewer. Painted in Tissot’s studio in St John’s Wood, London, this portrait is carefully staged, conveying Marsden’s ostentatious self-confidence through the setting as much as the sitter’s attitude.</p></div>
