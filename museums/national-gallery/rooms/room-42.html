She used <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a> crayons on paper to create soft, luminous portraits that have a luxurious appearance. A native of Venice, her international clientele – mainly British, French and German travellers passing through on their <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Grand Tour</a> – provided her with a lifelong source of commissions.

Carriera probably painted his portrait during the 1720s, when she was at the height of her career: the colours are delicate and subtly blended and the sitter’s facial expression hints at his character and mood.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Edgar Degas is often referred to as an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionist</a> painter, but his techniques and theories were different from theirs in several ways. Like them, he often portrayed nineteenth-century urban French life in all its garish modernity, and from 1874 he did exhibit at Impressionist exhibitions. But while Impressionist artists like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> almost abandoned line for colour, Degas was a great draughtsman. He adhered to his early classical training: drawing as the basis for all representation. Throughout his career, his approach to the creation of any picture was highly disciplined and entailed a great many preparatory studies both painted and drawn, often in charcoal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">From at least 1870, Degas suffered from a painful eye condition that needed constant treatment, periods of rest and efforts to find new ways of working. Because it was difficult for him to paint out of doors, he worked in a studio with controlled lighting, describing daylight as ‘more Monet than my eyes can stand’. He became increasingly conscious that perception is a matter of choice and wrote that for him, ‘drawing isn’t a matter of what you see, it’s a question of what you can make other people see.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For this and a number of other reasons, after 1880 Degas turned to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastels</a> as a preferred medium. Their matt texture resembled the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> of the Italian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> that he admired. Pastels in a variety of bright, ‘modern’ colours, some recent scientific creations, were available on the market, and they enabled him to draw with colour. ‘I am a colourist with line’, he wrote.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the mid-1880s, Degas used these pastels for a series of nudes. Far from the classical nudes of ancient Greece and Rome that inspired his contemporary, Ingres (see, for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D59-0001-0000-0000.htm">Angelica rescued by Ruggiero</a></span>), Degas’s nudes were real women engaged in the everyday activities of washing or bathing. This was a deliberate attack on tradition. He wrote: ‘hitherto the nude has always been represented in poses which presuppose an audience, but these women of mine are honest and simple folk… It is as if you looked through a keyhole.' He might well have said ‘through a lens’ rather than a keyhole. His interest in the new art of photography, and how the click of the shutter captured and froze a moment of action, continued to motivate him throughout his life, especially when painting these and other subjects in motion, such as dancers at the Opera and horses racing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this picture a woman sits beside a bath, drying her hair. She pitches forward with one arm raised to rub the towel on her neck. The other arm reaches back awkwardly, perhaps to steady herself on the edge of the bath, perhaps to grasp the second towel on the back of the chair. Both towels are swathed around the woman, almost like the drapery of a classical nude. Although the painting is an attack on contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">neo-classicism</a>, perhaps Degas was allowing himself a small homage to his early training, and perhaps subtly elevating the woman’s status. Or perhaps he was using irony. He has given the fabric a marble-like texture, with sculptural folds indicated by short dark strokes of pastel warmed a little with pale pink; the only real suggestion of ease or comfort is in the woman’s foot pushed into her yellow slipper on the flowered carpet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The ungainly but authentic-looking pose makes it easy to believe that Degas was present in the woman’s room, catching her the moment before she could straighten herself. She was in fact a model posing in his studio, and would have held the position for some time while Degas made the preliminary drawing, probably standing on a raised platform. He began with a visible charcoal outline of her arms and torso. Charcoal modelling can also be seen under the lattice of pink pastel strokes on her back, marking the crease in the flesh made by her shoulder pushing back as she twists her arm round to reach out.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Elsewhere the colours are strong and vivid, almost like those of the Impressionists, but in other places are more diffused. The brilliant yellow of the chair and the wall above it is held in check by calming strokes of blue. However energised are the colours and the strokes of pastel that make them, Degas allowed nothing to soften the impact of the startling red of the woman’s hair. It is echoed in a touch under her armpit, but tempered in the carpet by dark olive green.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The woman is almost uncannily alive. Although she was a model, a partner in the making of the picture, Degas has kept her face hidden. She is anonymous and depersonalised (as are the other women in this series of nudes), and as we look through the keyhole, or the lens, we are made to feel that she doesn’t know we are here. We are invited to witness an unknown woman in a very intimate moment. We intrude; the picture is beautiful but unnerving. We look and marvel but may be left with the impression that we should turn around, walk away and leave her to her privacy.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ballet held an endless fascination for Degas, whose studies of dancers occupied him for more than fifty years. Over half of his oeuvre was dedicated to the subject which he explored in a variety of media, from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oils</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastels</a> to sculptures and drawings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas enjoyed capturing moments behind the scenes, often depicting dancers in rehearsal or at rest rather than on stage. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ballet Dancers</span> is a typically informal portrayal of four ballerinas in the wings, relaxing during a moment’s repose. The work highlights the physical demands of the profession, offering us a snapshot into the reality of the dancers’ everyday life as opposed to the artifice of the performance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dressed in vibrant orange and turquoise tutus, the dancers are placed along a diagonal line within an asymmetrical composition cropped at the lower right, reflecting the influence of Japanese prints. In the foreground, the first ballerina squats down, maybe to tend to a sore muscle or to adjust a ribbon. The dancer behind her, visibly exhausted, rests her head in one hand. Behind them, a third dancer stands naturally in fourth position but her weight is relaxed onto one hip. She holds a brightly coloured fan. A fourth ballerina leans against a wall, perhaps observing the action on stage. The long, dark hair of a fifth dancer is just visible in the background, in the centre of the composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ballet Dancers</span> employs the complex pastel technique favoured by the artist from the 1880s in which he layered, blended and smudged the tones to create the effect of vivid colours. Although this seems to be a rapidly improvised pastel without preparatory drawing, such works were often the result of carefully designed composition. In Degas’s words, 'One must do the same subject over again ten times, a hundred times. In art nothing must resemble an accident, not even movement’. Each of the figures in this composition is, therefore, derived from earlier preparatory studies of individual dancers which were then used by Degas as source material for a variety of finished pieces, combining the figures creatively together, as is the case here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Each dancer can also be recognised in a number of other works by the artist. For example, the figure leaning against the wall can be compared to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dancer</span> of 1888 (The Burrell Collection, Glasgow), and the young woman standing next to her appears again in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dancer with a Fan</span> of about 1890–5 (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The pose of this second dancer with her hand resting on one hip may have derived in part from one of Degas’s sculptural works, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dancer at Rest, her Hands on her Hips, Right Leg Forward</span>, which the artist found invaluable in his study of the female form.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Signed at the bottom left corner, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ballet Dancers</span> was initially acquired by the art dealer Paul Durand-Ruel, who spent his life supporting, collecting and promoting the work of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the late 1890s a number of dance troupes from Eastern Europe were in Paris, where they performed at the Moulin Rouge, the Folies-Bergère, the Casino de Paris and at other less famous venues, including the Brasserie des Martyrs in Montmartre, near Degas’s home. The reputation of these performances was also enhanced by short black-and-white films made by the Lumière brothers, which Degas may have seen. It is almost certain that these visiting dancers, and those drawn by Degas, were Ukrainian, rather than Russian.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas may have been working on this large <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a> in 1899, when he showed three pastels of dancers to Julie Manet, the daughter of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QHK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Berthe Morisot</a>, who visited his studio on 1 July. The drawing is on tracing paper, which allowed Degas to combine dancers in different arrangements and also to reverse them from sheet to sheet. The central dancer (whose face we see) is the reversed figure from an earlier charcoal and pastel drawing, also on tracing paper, at the Berwick Museum and Art Gallery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">You can see where Degas added a strip of paper to the bottom of the sheet while working on the drawing so he could include the lower leg of the dancer closest to us. This addition raised her from the ground and also allowed him to show the hem of her dress. Degas focused on the overall design of the picture and not on the individual identity of the dancers – we only see one, broadly sketched, face. He uses bold outlines and shapes to convey dynamic movement.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The surface of the paper is heavily worked, as Degas applied the pastel thickly with repeated strokes to create highly layered areas made up of many rich hues. In her diary entry about her visit to Degas’s studio, Julie Manet records how he described these pastels as ‘orgies of colour'. The pitted surface – a distinctive feature of his late pastel technique – was caused by previous layers of wetted pastel forming small clumps of pigment under the fixative. As Degas applied more pastel, the surface became increasingly textured. Repeated use of fixative risked dulling the pastel, so he did not fix the final touches of pure colour, which you can see in the hair ribbons and in the red, yellow and blue flowers of the garlands. This further increased the picture’s fragility.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Wearing traditional folk costumes and stomping on the ground with their boots, these peasant dancers are very different from the classical ballerinas Degas had spent almost four decades drawing and painting. He also shows that the dance is performed outdoors, in a rural setting, not on stage. Classical ballet, which had its origins in the royal court, was based upon disciplined, graceful upward movement, but the emphatic gestures and movements of these earth-bound dancers recall more archaic rituals. The dozen or so pastels of Ukrainian dancers that Degas made show how even late in life he could take on new subjects and develop bold techniques.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is Henry Dawkins II (1727–1814) of Over Norton, Oxfordshire; Standlynch Park, Wiltshire and Portman Square, London. He was the third surviving son of Henry Dawkins I (1698–1744) and Elizabeth, daughter of Edward Pennant, Chief Justice of Jamaica.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Henry Dawkins was a member of the Jamaica Assembly during the years 1752–8, and a member of its Council in 1758–9. In 1754 he is recorded as having owned (with his brothers William and James) almost 25,000 acres in Jamaica. The family’s fortune was made through the ownership of slaves. By May 1759 he had left Jamaica for England, where he served at various times as Member of Parliament for Southampton, Chippenham and Hindon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 24 November 1760 he married Lady Juliana Colyear, daughter of Charles 2nd Earl of Portmore. The couple had eight sons and four daughters. A group portrait of about 1774 by Richard Brompton of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Family of Henry Dawkins</span> (National Trust, Penryn Castle, Bangor, on loan from C.J. Dawkins) shows Henry and Juliana with nine of their children.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that this <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a> portrait of Dawkins was made in Paris, where the artist was based, although there is no definite record of Dawkins visiting the city. A date of between 1750 and 1752 is likely due to the sitter’s young age. Henry’s elder brother James left England for Rome in 1749 and he certainly travelled via Paris, so it is possible that Henry accompanied him there either on that occasion or during another trip in 1751. The style of Dawkins’s wig and costume are consistent with a date of about 1751. His pose, with one hand tucked inside his waistcoat, was one frequently adopted for half-length portraits in the mid-eighteenth century, particularly by English sitters, to signify what François Nivelon had characterised in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Rudiments of Genteel Behaviour</span> (London, 1737) as ‘manly boldness tempered with modesty.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Even during his own lifetime Maurice-Quentin de La Tour was regarded as the greatest pastellist of the eighteenth century. Although born in Picardy, he spent almost his entire career in Paris, dominating the market there for portraits in pastel. His extreme perfectionism often placed him in danger of ruining his portraits by overworking them. The relative simplicity of the composition in this portrait may have been due to the limited time that Dawkins had in Paris. The colours, particularly the crimson of the coat, have faded.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At their breakfast table, an elegantly dressed woman watches a little girl dip a biscuit into a cup of milky coffee. As it is early morning, the girl wears paper curlers in her hair. Although the plain background beyond the cane back chairs gives little sense of the interior they are in, the figures’ clothing suggests that they are very comfortably off. Liotard has spared no details in his depictions of these fabrics, from the sheen of the woman’s black and pink striped silk dress, to the delicate pattern of her matching sleeves and apron, which even has tiny pins to fix it to her bodice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Coffee and chocolate were exclusive, luxurious beverages in the eighteenth century, often enjoyed at breakfast by those who could afford them. The highly polished lacquer tray in front of the two figures likewise signals luxury, and Liotard has lavished attention on the still-life elements piled on top of it. Very unusually, he has used a build-up of thick, wet pastel to create dimensional reflections on the silver coffee pot and Chinese porcelain. Pastel is an extremely fragile medium, sensitive to both light and movement, yet miraculously these impasto highlights remain intact and there are no signs of fading on the delicate blue designs of the porcelain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Liotard worked in oil, chalk, enamel and even painted on glass, he is best known for his use of pastel. This soft, friable material – composed of chalk, pigment and a gum binder – was perfectly suited to portraiture, producing rapid, luminous likenesses. Liotard’s pastels were both highly sought after and highly priced: in London in the early 1750s, a pastel head by Liotard commanded a higher fee than a full-length portrait in oil by the young Joshua Reynolds. Due to its size, ambition and the quality of its execution, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Lavergne Family Breakfast</span> has long been viewed as Liotard’s masterpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the sheet music that pokes out from the open drawer, we can just make out a minute signature and date: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Liotard / a lion / 1754 (‘Liotard / in Lyon / 1754’)</span>. Although this picture is not strictly a portrait, its sitters have long been associated with the Lavergne family, relatives of Liotard’s who lived in Lyon. He himself described the figures as mother and daughter, but the sitters were probably his niece and one of her own nieces. We know that Liotard visited his family in Lyon in the summer of 1754, and that he brought this pastel back with him to London. It was here that he sold it for 200 guineas – an extremely high sum –  to Viscount Duncannon, later 2nd Earl of Bessborough (1704–1793), his most important patron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1773, Liotard returned to London and made a precise replica of this extraordinary pastel in oil (today in a private collection). The pastel has remained in Britain since 1754, and had not been exhibited or seen by the public prior to its arrival at the National Gallery.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Odilon Redon (1840–1916) frequently made reference to both classic and contemporary literature in his work, and the subject of the drowned Ophelia, taken from Shakespeare’s tragedy <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hamlet</span> (Act IV, Scene VII), was one he often returned to between 1900 and 1908. This was a period when Redon was moving away from monochrome drawings and prints, with grotesque and macabre subjects, towards a more lyrical exploration of colour using pastel and oils. This turn to colour was due in part to his contact with younger artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Gauguin</a>, Emile Bernard and Maurice Denis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But the broader influence of Japanese prints is evident here too, particularly in the decorative flatness of the picture and the use of flowers. Redon employs pastel to full effect, creating an almost abstract design as glowing areas of intense colour are given jewel-like definition with swiftly-drawn black outlines or colour highlights. The use of complementary colours (a patch of orange placed against ultramarine blue, red and pinks juxtaposed with varieties of green) enhances the overall luminous effect.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Shakespeare’s doomed heroine, Ophelia, was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists. Redon knew <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Death of Ophelia</span> (1844, Louvre, Paris) by the French artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eugėne Delacroix</a>, who also produced a series of lithographs illustrating scenes from <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hamlet</span>. He had also seen <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ophelia</span> (1851–2, Tate Britain) by the English Pre-Raphaelite, John Everett Millais, when visiting London in 1895. Millais’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ophelia</span> is a much more literal response to the details provided by Shakespeare’s text, but Redon’s treatment of the same subject is radically different. Unlike the almost scientific precision of Millais, who painted the individual plants and foliage on the riverbank, Redon creates an undefined space that lacks any clear indication of either location or scale. We see only Ophelia’s head, placed close to the picture’s edge in the lower right corner. Tilted back, and in profile, it is suspended or perhaps floating. In contrast to the vibrant flowers that surround her, Ophelia is drained of colour. Her closed eyes suggest she may already be dead, or possibly she is only sleeping. Garlanded by flowers, she merges with the plants that surround her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Ophelia recalled older narratives of doomed young love, such as the story of Orpheus, another popular subject in art, literature and music. This association of youthful and transient beauty with dreaming, sleep and death was a recurrent theme in Romantic and Symbolist art and literature in the late nineteenth century. In the 1890s Sigmund Freud began his pioneering research into dreams and the unconscious, which culminated in his landmark book <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Interpretation of Dreams</span>, published in 1900. But the fate of Ophelia may also have had a personal resonance for Redon: in July 1888 he had watched, helpless, as his friend and collaborator, the young critic Emile Hennequin, had drowned.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although it has a literary source, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ophelia among the Flowers</span> is more than an illustration of a text. Instead, Redon creates a dream-like response to Shakespeare’s drama that functions as an image in its own right. As Redon observed, ‘My drawings inspire, and are not to be defined. They place us, as does music, in the ambiguous realm of the undetermined.’</p></div>
