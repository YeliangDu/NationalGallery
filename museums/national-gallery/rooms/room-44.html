This is one of three similar <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> paintings of the park surrounding the chateau at Chantilly that Cezanne produced during his stay there. The two other paintings are in the Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio and the Berggruen Museum, Berlin. There is also a watercolour of the same view, most likely a page from a sketchbook, in a private collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In all these paintings, Cezanne focused on the avenue or path running through the Chantilly forest rather than on the town’s famous castle, which, although framed by an arch of trees, remains largely undefined. This vista, with its innate geometrical format, may in part have appealed to Cezanne not for its historic associations, but because it reminded him of the avenues of chestnut trees at the family home, the Jas de Bouffan, in Aix-en-Provence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both Chantilly and the Jas de Bouffan offered Cezanne views with clearly defined structures that he sought to describe in paint. The problem of how to represent three-dimensional space and volume on a flat surface was one that engaged Cezanne for much of his career. He has addressed this challenge here by choosing an overtly symmetrical view of a landscape that itself had already been designed – with an avenue cutting through the trees. Human presence is further represented by the wooden fences that cross the avenue in the middle distance and by the single post in the centre foreground (standing in for both the artist and the viewer). Cezanne created an effect of depth by building up the landscape as a mosaic of carefully organised coloured patches whose relation to each other is affected by the size and direction of the brushstrokes and by Cezanne’s control of colour and tone.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Colour, for Cezanne, was the basis of perception, and by the 1880s both his use of it and his oil painting technique had been shaped by his experience with watercolour. The method Cezanne developed in his watercolours is evident in the looser, more open technique of his oil paintings from this time and in his use of overlapping planes of colour. For this picture Cezanne has lightly sketched in the composition with pencil lines, which were then overlain with areas of colour. Some of these areas were reworked, particularly near the centre of the picture, but elsewhere he has left the creamy beige primer visible so that it forms part of the overall colour scheme. Warm colours (for example, the terracotta red of the roof near the picture’s centre and the ochre of the avenue) contrast with cooler blues, greens and greys, and variations of tone suggest the play of light on foliage. Alternating bands of light and shade create an effect of depth, and darker touches of blue and green define the structure of the trees and fences.</p></div>

This was a significant period in his life, as he had stopped exhibiting with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionist</a> group after 1879 and was spending more time in the south of France, away from the capital. He was now middle-aged with a family to support, and the intensity of his earlier self portraits has given way to a more distant and reflective presence. Although relatively small, this portrait has a monumentality and authority to it. Despite its simple format, Cezanne has created a composition formed of subtle dualities and repetitions</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most likely looking into a mirror, Cezanne stares at us calmly and dispassionately, his face devoid of overt expression. The light coming in from the left of the picture, probably from a window, illuminates one side of his head and casts the other in shadow, giving volume to the cranium placed against the flat plane of the wall. Cezanne constructed the dome of the head with layers of paint formed of short oblique patches of colour laid down in parallel strokes. He used the whites, reds and ochre we might expect for skin tones, but his ear and the top of his head are outlined in blue, and there are also bluish shadows and touches of light green on the right side of the head. These colours echo tints in the jacket and in the slightly lighter tones of the dull olive-green wallpaper. On the left, a vertical band of plain pale blue relieves the potentially oppressive effect of the dominant olive-brown palette and suggests space beyond.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The wallpaper itself, which appears in other paintings, is not merely a decorative backdrop, but has an important structural role in the composition. By repeating elements of its pattern throughout the picture, Cezanne has fully integrated himself with his surroundings. For example, he positioned himself against the wallpaper so that the triangle formed by his outline is echoed by the two sides of a triangle behind the top half of his head. He has also deliberately halted the diagonal lines of the wallpaper pattern before they reach him. As a result, his pale head not only stands out more clearly against the dark paper, but his curved cranium is both emphasised by and contrasts with the three straight lines of a large diamond. Like a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN7-0008-0000-0000.htm">halo</a> it frames the left side of his head, the curve of which is echoed by the right shoulder. The lines of the wallpaper only make contact with Cezanne himself at his upturned left lapel, its zigzag outline repeating the pattern of the paper. Similarly, the wallpaper’s motif of star-crossed diamond-shaped lozenges, which themselves echo the principal pattern of the paper, is repeated by the shape of his right eye and ear. The eyes themselves are not quite symmetrical: the left is flat and set back in shadow, while the right is fully open and alert. A gleam of light on the iris is rendered by a tiny lick of golden-brown paint.</p></div>

Surrounded by wild vegetation, the run-down buildings of the isolated chateau offered Cezanne a variety of motifs, and it became one of his favourite locations. Although he stopped renting a room in 1902, when he moved into his newly completed studio at nearby Les Lauves, he continued to paint in the grounds until his death in 1906, travelling there by hired car.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are looking at a group of trees growing along a remote rocky ridge on a hill north-east of the house. The diagonal slope of the hill is so steep that the rocks seem close to tumbling out of the frame.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Château Noir was a rambling house situated in extensive grounds between Aix-en-Provence and Le Tholonet in the south of France. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a> rented a small room in the house from 1897 and tried, unsuccessfully, to buy the property two years later when his family home, the Jas de Bouffan, was sold. Surrounded by wild vegetation, the run-down buildings of the isolated chateau offered Cezanne a variety of motifs, and it became one of his favourite locations. Although he stopped renting a room in 1902, when he moved into his newly completed studio at nearby Les Lauves, he continued to paint in the grounds until his death in 1906, travelling there by hired car.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are looking at a group of trees growing along a remote rocky ridge on a hill north-east of the house. The diagonal slope of the hill is so steep that the rocks seem close to tumbling out of the frame.

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Akseli Gallen-Kallela completed this painting in 1905. It is one of four related pictures he produced around that time of Lake Keitele, in a remote part of central Finland. The picture reflects the mood of Finnish nationalism that was growing in the late nineteenth century. At this time, Finland was an autonomous Grand Duchy of the Russian Empire; it did not become an independent state until 1917, following the Bolshevik Revolution. Landscape, especially when associated with mythology, was an important expression of the desire for Finnish autonomy. Writers, artists and musicians drew upon the ancient Finnish folk poems and myths contained in the epic saga <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> Kalevala</span>, first published in 1835. Gallen-Kallela himself used it from the mid-1880s as a source for paintings, and it is referred to in this picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike Gallen-Kallela’s earlier paintings inspired by <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Kalevala</span>, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lake Keitele</span> does not include any figures. The only trace of human presence is the distinctive zigzag pattern on the lake’s surface. Although a natural occurrence caused by the interaction of the wind with the lake’s currents, Gallen-Kellela referred to this pattern as ‘Väinämöinen’s wake’ – the trace made by Väinämöinen, the bard and principal character of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Kalevala</span>, as he rows across the lake. The artist wrote to a friend that the ’silvery stripes at the surface of the serene water are the wavelets announcing the passion to come'. This implied reference to Väinämöinen, with whom Gallen-Kallela may have personally identified, reveals his nationalist loyalties.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting’s composition is particularly striking. An almost flat design, made up of broad, blue-grey diagonal bands that cross the lake’s surface, is paired with a more realistic depiction of shimmering waves and ripples in the foreground. Areas of bare canvas add texture and tone. Gallen-Kallela uses a deliberately archaic style, influenced by the decorative abstraction and primitivism of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Gauguin</a> and by Finnish folk art, that also has echoes of stained glass and textiles (media he also worked with). The principal colours are kept within a nearly monochrome range of cool silver-greys and blues. Despite the relatively small size of the canvas, an effect of expansive space is produced by the fact that we are looking directly over the water rather than standing securely on the lakeshore. This effect is enhanced by the position of the small wooded island, horizon and thin band of blue sky and bright white clouds at the very top of the picture. The different sizes, directions and textures of the brushstrokes further enhance a sense of space opening out.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lake Keitele</span> Gallen-Kallela combines meditative stillness with the forces of nature, and ancient narratives with contemporary political debate, to create a vision of an uncorrupted wilderness imbued with symbolic and emotional meaning.</p></div>

        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is one of 14 views of the Boulevard Montmartre in Paris that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Camille Pissarro</a> painted  in 1897. It is the only example of a night painting by him. In February 1897 Pissarro, then in his late sixties, took a room in the Grand Hôtel de Russie on Rue Drouot, which at the time joined the Boulevard des Italiens. The hotel was on the corner of the two streets. East of the hotel was the Boulevard Montmartre, which, despite its name, is not in Montmartre, an area in north-west Paris that was particularly favoured by artists; it is instead the most easterly of Paris’s grand boulevards. To the hotel’s west was the Boulevard Haussmann, named after Baron Haussmann.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A civic planner and Prefect of the Seine during the Second Empire (1852–1870), Haussmann had radically reshaped much of Paris. He tore down the cramped medieval quarters and replaced them with the wide boulevards and landscaped parks that have come to define the city. The new urban spaces he created, and the commercial and leisure activities they fostered, had fascinated artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and Renoir, especially in the 1860s and 1870s. But by the end of the century, most of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>, and the avant-garde artists who came after them, had largely stopped painting urban subjects. The decision by Pissarro, who was best known for his paintings of rural and peasant life, to return to Paris specifically to paint city views may have been influenced by his health, particularly the condition of his eyes, which made painting outdoors increasingly difficult.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps thinking of Monet’s series paintings, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Haystacks</span>, Pissarro’s plan was to paint the Boulevard Montmartre at various times of the day and during different seasons and weather conditions – in snow, rain, fog, mist and sunlight, in both winter and spring, and in the morning, afternoon, at sunset and at night. The commercial success of Monet’s series may also have been an incentive. Writing to his son Lucien on 8 February 1897, Pissarro commented that Paul Durand-Ruel, the art dealer who had recently bought a group of six small paintings of street ‘snow effects’, had suggested a series of the boulevards, but this time on larger canvases: ‘A series of paintings of the boulevards seems to him a good idea, and it will be interesting to overcome the difficulties. I engaged a large room at the Grand Hôtel de Russie, 1 rue Drouot, from which I can see the whole sweep of boulevards almost as far as the Porte Saint-Denis, anyway as far as the boulevard Bonne Nouvelle.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Looking south from the window of his spacious room, Pissarro could see the Boulevard Montmartre to his left. By slightly changing his position and looking to his right, he could also see the Boulevard des Italiens, of which he painted two large and ‘terribly difficult views‘. Writing on 13 February to another son, Georges, Pissarro observed, ‘I have begun my series of boulevards. I have a splendid motif which I am going to explore under all possible effects, to my left; I have another motif which is terribly difficult, almost as the crow flies, looking over the carriages, buses and people milling about between the large trees and big houses which I have to set up right – it’s tricky… it goes without saying that I must solve it all the same.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clearly, Pissarro regarded painting the Boulevard Montmartre as a technical challenge to be solved, not least because he had to master the perspective from his high vantage point. In the painting perspective is defined by the diagonal lines created principally by the rooftops and pavements, which are reinforced by the rows of carriages, trees and street lamps. As they recede eastwards towards the Porte Sainte-Denis in the far distance, these lines form a series of triangles, the apexes of which meet at a point just left of the painting’s centre. The plunging ‘V’ of the night sky, its inverted shape echoed by the boulevard below, further enhances the effect of space and depth. Pissarro painted the sky using a fan-like pattern of strokes that explodes upwards from the horizon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perspective was not the only challenge facing Pissarro in this picture. His usual territory was the countryside, seen in daylight and predominantly in tones of green, blue and brown. Now he confronted a manmade urban environment illuminated entirely by artificial light. Even the moon and stars are absent. In the foreground, at the bottom of the picture, you can see the pale orb of an electric streetlight, which Pissarro painted using a brush thickly loaded with paint, with more lights behind it. The ‘electric candle’ arc lamp invented in 1876 was a very recent addition to Paris’s streets. Pissarro contrasted the arc lamp’s cool white light, framed by a halo of indigo blue, with the warmer gaslight of the shop windows, painted with strokes of yellow and orange. The oil-burning lamps of the cabs waiting outside the Théâtre des Variétés, painted as two lines of dots formed with tiny dabs of red, white and yellow, introduce a further source of light. Pissarro enhanced the effect of these various lights by painting the boulevard after it had been raining.

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is one of 14 views of the Boulevard Montmartre in Paris that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Camille Pissarro</a> painted  in 1897. It is the only example of a night painting by him. In February 1897 Pissarro, then in his late sixties, took a room in the Grand Hôtel de Russie on Rue Drouot, which at the time joined the Boulevard des Italiens. The hotel was on the corner of the two streets. East of the hotel was the Boulevard Montmartre, which, despite its name, is not in Montmartre, an area in north-west Paris that was particularly favoured by artists; it is instead the most easterly of Paris’s grand boulevards. To the hotel’s west was the Boulevard Haussmann, named after Baron Haussmann.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A civic planner and Prefect of the Seine during the Second Empire (1852–1870), Haussmann had radically reshaped much of Paris. He tore down the cramped medieval quarters and replaced them with the wide boulevards and landscaped parks that have come to define the city. The new urban spaces he created, and the commercial and leisure activities they fostered, had fascinated artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and Renoir, especially in the 1860s and 1870s. But by the end of the century, most of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>, and the avant-garde artists who came after them, had largely stopped painting urban subjects. The decision by Pissarro, who was best known for his paintings of rural and peasant life, to return to Paris specifically to paint city views may have been influenced by his health, particularly the condition of his eyes, which made painting outdoors increasingly difficult.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps thinking of Monet’s series paintings, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Haystacks</span>, Pissarro’s plan was to paint the Boulevard Montmartre at various times of the day and during different seasons and weather conditions – in snow, rain, fog, mist and sunlight, in both winter and spring, and in the morning, afternoon, at sunset and at night. The commercial success of Monet’s series may also have been an incentive. Writing to his son Lucien on 8 February 1897, Pissarro commented that Paul Durand-Ruel, the art dealer who had recently bought a group of six small paintings of street ‘snow effects’, had suggested a series of the boulevards, but this time on larger canvases: ‘A series of paintings of the boulevards seems to him a good idea, and it will be interesting to overcome the difficulties. I engaged a large room at the Grand Hôtel de Russie, 1 rue Drouot, from which I can see the whole sweep of boulevards almost as far as the Porte Saint-Denis, anyway as far as the boulevard Bonne Nouvelle.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Looking south from the window of his spacious room, Pissarro could see the Boulevard Montmartre to his left. By slightly changing his position and looking to his right, he could also see the Boulevard des Italiens, of which he painted two large and ‘terribly difficult views‘. Writing on 13 February to another son, Georges, Pissarro observed, ‘I have begun my series of boulevards. I have a splendid motif which I am going to explore under all possible effects, to my left; I have another motif which is terribly difficult, almost as the crow flies, looking over the carriages, buses and people milling about between the large trees and big houses which I have to set up right – it’s tricky… it goes without saying that I must solve it all the same.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clearly, Pissarro regarded painting the Boulevard Montmartre as a technical challenge to be solved, not least because he had to master the perspective from his high vantage point. In the painting perspective is defined by the diagonal lines created principally by the rooftops and pavements, which are reinforced by the rows of carriages, trees and street lamps. As they recede eastwards towards the Porte Sainte-Denis in the far distance, these lines form a series of triangles, the apexes of which meet at a point just left of the painting’s centre. The plunging ‘V’ of the night sky, its inverted shape echoed by the boulevard below, further enhances the effect of space and depth. Pissarro painted the sky using a fan-like pattern of strokes that explodes upwards from the horizon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perspective was not the only challenge facing Pissarro in this picture. His usual territory was the countryside, seen in daylight and predominantly in tones of green, blue and brown. Now he confronted a manmade urban environment illuminated entirely by artificial light. Even the moon and stars are absent. In the foreground, at the bottom of the picture, you can see the pale orb of an electric streetlight, which Pissarro painted using a brush thickly loaded with paint, with more lights behind it. The ‘electric candle’ arc lamp invented in 1876 was a very recent addition to Paris’s streets. Pissarro contrasted the arc lamp’s cool white light, framed by a halo of indigo blue, with the warmer gaslight of the shop windows, painted with strokes of yellow and orange. The oil-burning lamps of the cabs waiting outside the Théâtre des Variétés, painted as two lines of dots formed with tiny dabs of red, white and yellow, introduce a further source of light. Pissarro enhanced the effect of these various lights by painting the boulevard after it had been raining. His capturing of reflected light on the wet pavement is particularly effective on the right side of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pissarro did not complete the picture in one sitting – areas have been repainted – but his application of the paint is direct and immediate. By the 1890s, he’d abandoned the highly methodical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKI-0008-0000-0000.htm">pointillist</a> technique he had adopted from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Seurat</a>.

In places, especially when viewed up close, the paint has an almost abstract quality. Alive with energy, it complements the activity in the street before us.</p></div>

A busy market town 30 kilometres north-west of Paris, Pontoise and its surroundings offered Pissarro access to quiet rural areas dotted with traditional farm buildings, which were locations for many of his paintings. The same hillside appears in at least one other work by him and was also painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a> when he visited Pissarro in 1877, the year in which this picture was painted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The choice of a relatively large canvas – almost double the size Pissarro typically worked with – suggests this was intended to be a monumental painting with a carefully planned composition. Pissarro has used the rows of slender tree trunks to divide the painting into a sequence of narrow vertical bands which are counterbalanced by the near horizontal lines of the hedges, roofs and distant hilltops. A path in the lower left corner leads us into the landscape, but the picture space is quite shallow. This spatial compression is enhanced by the relatively high horizon that contains the sky within just the upper third of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite being a leading <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionist</a>, Pissarro was never entirely comfortable with the swift, fluid brushwork that characterised much Impressionist painting of the early 1870s, even though he had adopted its methods. Perhaps looking to the work of his younger friend Cezanne, he was moving away here from the fleeting atmospheric effects of Impressionism to focus on construction.

The paint in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Côte des Bœufs at L'Hermitage</span> was applied so densely in some areas that the canvas had to be lined to give it extra strength.

Although he had not yet developed his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKI-0008-0000-0000.htm">pointillist</a> technique, it is perhaps anticipated here, especially in the juxtaposed dabs of pink, blue and yellow-green in the lower-right foreground.</p></div>

He intended it to be a grand statement with which he would make his mark at the official <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> in the spring of 1884. It shows several men and boys relaxing in the sun on the banks of the Seine, between the bridges at Asnières and Courbevoie, north-west of central Paris. In the background is a railway bridge that partly hides a parallel road bridge, as well as the chimneys of the gas plant and factories at Clichy, where some of the men may work. Recreational sailboats can be seen on the river.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When Seurat studied the location in preparation for the painting, there would have been a path along the embankment as well as run-down houses and villas, boatyards, workshops and lower-class cafes and restaurants. The exposed sand in the middle of the riverbank on the left is the reason for the painting sometimes being titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Une baignade</span> (‘a bathing place’). The term did not imply a middle-class idea of recreation by the water, but instead signified a place of work. It was used, for example on maps of the river, to indicate places where horses and dogs could be bathed and watered. It was this practice, and the dragging of boats in and out of the water, that formed the sandy gully.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Seurat was often drawn to similar subjects and sites as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionists</a>, and employed the same colour theories, his treatment was radically different. Not only is this picture much larger than most Impressionist paintings, but it was executed in the studio rather than outdoors in just one or two sessions. In contrast to the spontaneity of Impressionist works, Seurat’s picture was meticulously planned. He completed a series of preparatory oil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">sketches</a> of the site and numerous conté crayon life drawings of the figures. Of these, some 13 oil sketches and 10 drawings survive. Two oil <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Studies for Bathers at Asnières</span> are also in the National Gallery’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The men’s clothing (the bowler hat, boots and sleeveless vest) and demeanour (for example, the slight slouch of the seated boy and his blunt profile) suggest that some of them are either workers or lower middle class. However, none are engaged in traditionally ‘masculine’ activities such as labour or sport – even the two in the water do not appear to be swimming. By way of social contrast, a bourgeois couple, complete with parasol and top hat, are being ferried across the river in a boat bearing a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">triclore</span> flag. Their oarsman is the only person in the picture who is working. Although the painting does not convey an obvious political statement, Seurat’s depiction of working-class recreation – as distinct from Impressionist scenes of bourgeois leisure (of which the boating couple are a reminder) – was a challenge to artistic tradition, as the grand scale was more appropriate for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0008-0000-0000.htm">academic</a> painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The men and boys on the riverbank are as immobile as sculptures. Seurat also shows them in profile, as if in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>, their smooth bodies defined by unbroken outlines. Although they occupy the same small area of riverbank, each seems absorbed in his own thoughts, neither engaging with each other nor with us. Suffused with bright but hazy sunlight, the scene has an almost eerie stillness, as if time has been suspended and all movement temporarily frozen. Seurat has enhanced this effect by not showing activities one might expect to see – for example, no horses are being bathed (although several of the preparatory studies do include them) – and by presenting this stretch of the river as if it were a well-maintained park.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seurat had a traditional academic training at the École des Beaux-Arts in Paris, where he learned to draw from classical sculptures; several of the bathers’ poses reflect this. On the far right, the boy standing in the water with his hands cupped to his mouth evokes the Greek water god Triton blowing his conch shell. Seurat also studied paintings in the Louvre, and in this picture the simplicity of forms, use of regular shapes defined by light and the pale, almost alabaster skin tones recall paintings by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero della Francesca</a>, especially his Arezzo <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But there are also more contemporary associations. Seurat admired Puvis de Chavannes (with whom he was compared), and aspects of his painting are also features of Puvis’s work: its scale (which recalls a mural rather than an easel painting), the semi-nude figures arranged in lateral planes like a classical relief and a composition based upon clear geometrical principles. Puvis’s painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Doux pays</span> (‘gentle landscape’) (Musée Bonnat, Bayonne), which was exhibited at the 1882 Salon, particularly anticipated elements of Seurat’s picture. However, unlike Puvis, who kept modernity at a distance, Seurat found order, harmony and perhaps even a heroic grandeur in the modern world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seurat was soon to go on to create <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKI-0008-0000-0000.htm">pointillism</a>, a technique that employed tiny dots of complementary colours. This picture is not painted in the pointillist style of his later works, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Channel of Gravelines</span>, although he did repaint parts of it using this technique – for example, the orange hat was reworked later with spots of yellow and blue. Despite the painting’s classicising features, Seurat’s application of paint is modern. For example, he used broad brushstrokes for the water. This follows the precedent of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and Renoir, who had both painted this part of the river – the railway bridge in the background is the same as that in Renoir’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CMA-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Skiff</a></span>, a painting also based upon complementary colours.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seurat’s painting was rejected when submitted to the Salon, and he subsequently exhibited it at the newly formed Salon des Artistes Indépendants. His second monumental picture, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte</span> of 1885 (Art Institute of Chicago), shows the same stretch of river but looking across it from the other side. The clump of trees on the right behind the bourgeois couple in the boat (who may have been added later as a link between the two pictures) is the tip of the island. La Grande Jatte was a location for middle-class leisure from which the workers we see here are separated both spatially and socially.

        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While working on his meticulous paintings in the studio, Seurat also made small studies outdoors on wooden panels, which he called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">croquetons</span>.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose">
          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between 1882 and 1886 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Seurat</a> made more than 100 identically sized landscape studies. These <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panels</a> look like they were painted on site, and follow the long-established tradition of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFY-0008-0000-0000.htm">plein-air</a> oil sketch. Many were preparatory studies for his first two monumental paintings – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bathers at Asnières</a></span> (1884) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</span> (1884–6, Art Institute of Chicago). After the exhibition of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grande Jatte</span>, Seurat continued to work occasionally in the adjacent suburbs of Courbevoie and Asnières in north-west Paris, the setting for both paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was most likely painted in 1885 and relates to a medium-size canvas, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Seine at Courbevoie</span> (private collection, Paris). It may have preceded Seurat’s decision to paint this particular view of the river, or it may be a preparatory study for the painting. The vertical format is unusual for Seurat, but it allowed him to arrange the composition as a series of stacked horizontal bands formed by the foreground, the river, the far riverbank and the houses and trees of Courbevoie in the distance. Although we are looking across the water towards the opposite riverbank some distance away, these lateral bands reduce the effect of spatial depth and atmospheric recession, as does the placing of the sky near the very top of the picture. The bands are, however, counterbalanced by the continuous vertical of the tree trunk on the right and the shorter vertical of the standing woman on the left, her brown dress partly echoing the darker brown of the tree. Although Seurat has focused on the landscape in this sketch, many of its components are reiterated from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grande Jatte</span> – for example, the river Seine and its grassy bank, a standing female figure, the emphatic vertical of the tree and the high skyline.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A focus on the underlying structure of the scene is a feature of Seurat’s art, but his application of the paint softens the geometry of the composition. Although Seurat had developed his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKI-0008-0000-0000.htm">pointillist</a> technique by 1885, his debt to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a> is still evident here, and the freshness of his brushwork especially recalls the earlier work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pissarro</a>. Seurat worked rapidly, leaving traces of the bare wood of the panel visible between the brushstrokes. Unlike in some of his sketches, he has not built up the brushwork in layers, although some areas are more densely worked (for example, the roof tops where the colours have mixed together while still wet). The individual strokes themselves are relatively large and fluid, unlike the tighter, more uniform brushwork of pointillism, and are laid down as clean, unmixed colours. Seurat has also modified them according to the object or surface they describe. For example, he has used horizontal lozenge-like strokes for the shimmering water (which recall Monet’s brushwork in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D13-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bathers at La Grenouillère</a></span>), shorter, choppier strokes for the grass and foliage, and longer, sinuous strokes for the tree trunk. The pale yellows and whites used throughout much of the painting create an effect of warm sunlight and contrast with the dark border formed by the tree and the touches of dark green at the very bottom of the picture.</p></div>
          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between 1882 and 1886 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Seurat</a> made more than 100 identically sized landscape studies. These <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panels</a> look like they were painted on site, and follow the long-established tradition of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFY-0008-0000-0000.htm">plein-air</a> oil sketch. Many were preparatory studies for his first two monumental paintings – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bathers at Asnières</a></span> (1884) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</span> (1884–6, Art Institute of Chicago). After the exhibition of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grande Jatte</span>, Seurat continued to work occasionally in the adjacent suburbs of Courbevoie and Asnières in north-west Paris, the setting for both paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was most likely painted in 1885 and relates to a medium-size canvas, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Seine at Courbevoie</span> (private collection, Paris). It may have preceded Seurat’s decision to paint this particular view of the river, or it may be a preparatory study for the painting. The vertical format is unusual for Seurat, but it allowed him to arrange the composition as a series of stacked horizontal bands formed by the foreground, the river, the far riverbank and the houses and trees of Courbevoie in the distance. Although we are looking across the water towards the opposite riverbank some distance away, these lateral bands reduce the effect of spatial depth and atmospheric recession, as does the placing of the sky near the very top of the picture. The bands are, however, counterbalanced by the continuous vertical of the tree trunk on the right and the shorter vertical of the standing woman on the left, her brown dress partly echoing the darker brown of the tree. Although Seurat has focused on the landscape in this sketch, many of its components are reiterated from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grande Jatte</span> – for example, the river Seine and its grassy bank, a standing female figure, the emphatic vertical of the tree and the high skyline.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A focus on the underlying structure of the scene is a feature of Seurat’s art, but his application of the paint softens the geometry of the composition. Although Seurat had developed his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKI-0008-0000-0000.htm">pointillist</a> technique by 1885, his debt to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a> is still evident here, and the freshness of his brushwork especially recalls the earlier work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pissarro</a>. Seurat worked rapidly, leaving traces of the bare wood of the panel visible between the brushstrokes. Unlike in some of his sketches, he has not built up the brushwork in layers, although some areas are more densely worked (for example, the roof tops where the colours have mixed together while still wet). The individual strokes themselves are relatively large and fluid, unlike the tighter, more uniform brushwork of pointillism, and are laid down as clean, unmixed colours. Seurat has also modified them according to the object or surface they describe. For example, he has used horizontal lozenge-like strokes for the shimmering water (which recall Monet’s brushwork in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D13-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bathers at La Grenouillère</a></span>), shorter, choppier strokes for the grass and foliage, and longer, sinuous strokes for the tree trunk. The pale yellows and whites used throughout much of the painting create an effect of warm sunlight and contrast with the dark border formed by the tree and the touches of dark green at the very bottom of the picture.</p></div>
