        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SGJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">George Bellows</a> is perhaps best known for his pictures of boxing matches, which he began painting around 1904, shortly after his arrival in New York City from his native Ohio. However, he painted across a diverse range of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genres</a> – portraits, landscapes, seascapes and city scenes, such as this one – although he usually addressed more contemporary subjects in the drawings and lithographs he produced for left-wing and social reform publications.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In common with an informal group of older American artists, nicknamed the Ashcan School for their supposedly squalid subject matter, he focused on the realities of contemporary life, especially everyday life in the cities. Bellows had been a student of Robert Henri, the unofficial leader of the Ashcan School, who taught at the New York School of Art. An admirer of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a>, whose work he had seen in Paris, Henri rejected <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0008-0000-0000.htm">academic</a> painting and what he regarded as overly genteel American <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>. He told his students to ‘paint the everyday world in America just as it had been done in France,’ asserting that artists should have ‘a Dickens-like interest in the people and their life’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture is the last and most ambitious in a series of wintry river landscapes that Bellows painted between 1908 and 1912. He had initially focused on views of the Hudson and East River, but in the final group of paintings, which includes this one completed in February 1912 (just two months before the scheduled arrival of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Titanic</span> in New York), it is the riverfront that provides a stage for human activity. Bellows’s choice of a large canvas suggests he regarded <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Men of the Docks</span> as a major painting, and it was his only submission to the National Academy of Design annual show in 1912. The painting subsequently toured the Midwest and was awarded the Sesnan Medal for best landscape at the Pennsylvania Academy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Positioned on the waterfront of the East River, near Brooklyn Heights, we are looking across the partly frozen waters towards the tall buildings of Lower Manhattan. On the right, the massive hull of an ocean liner is flanked by a tugboat that is almost a scaled-down version of it. The liner and the warehouse in shadow on the left form two powerful diagonals that meet at the sunlit Manhattan skyline, which rises from the water like a cliff face. The repeated use of blue helps draw us into the picture. Waterfront views of Manhattan’s architecture towering above the river were already a popular subject in photography. Perhaps the most well-known image was Alfred Stieglitz’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The City of Ambitions</span>, first published in the October 1911 edition of his magazine <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Camera Work</span>. His view of Manhattan swathed in steam and smoke rising from the shimmering water was among the first of many photographs to present New York as an example of the modern sublime. Just above the liner, Bellows has included the top of Brooklyn Bridge, another iconic landmark of modern New York. Completed in 1883, it was the world’s first steel-wire suspension bridge. On close examination, the cables running from the top of one of its turrets are visible; curiously, Bellows has painted the neo-Gothic arches of the turret as rounded, rather than pointed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seen from a relatively low vantage point, the warehouse, liner and skyline form three sides of a box, the fourth wall of which is formed in part by the group of longshoremen, who are most likely waiting to unload the liner. Longshoremen (the dockers or stevedores who manually loaded and unloaded ships) were casual labourers, often newly arrived immigrants whose employment was frequently controlled by corrupt union bosses. Their livelihood was precarious and they had a poor reputation. By placing the men against the Manhattan skyline, Bellows ironically contrasts the dynamic centre of modern capitalism – the great ‘city of ambitions’ – with the harsh reality of the people whose labour kept it functioning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Wearing thick jackets, their hands deep in their pockets and their collars turned up against the cold, the men seem to be listening to an announcement, probably a roll call of who will be working that day. Bellows shows the moment as the inactivity of waiting is about to transform into the physical exertion of heavy work. On the left of the picture, a hunched man, his head bowed, appears to be leaving, perhaps having been told he has not been chosen. His isolation from the group is emphasised by his distance from them and by his being completely in shadow. Although Bellows has painted the men in some detail, their faces and bodies are reduced to essentials. Some are close to being caricatures: the brute physical presence of the largest man on the right, for example, becomes a human version of the powerful dray horses behind him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Terms such as ‘brutal’, ‘rough’ and ‘wallop’ were often used, approvingly, to describe Bellows’s painting technique and they seem particularly appropriate for his treatment of the men here. These descriptions of a violent or aggressive application of paint perhaps reflect an emphasis on manliness and physicality during the era of President Theodore Roosevelt. As one critic noted, evoking Roosevelt’s well-known love of hunting, Bellows ’slams on his colour most indecorously with splendid effect … He shoots with both barrels of his gun but he bags his game.‘ These descriptions perhaps overlook the astonishing dexterity of Bellows’s exuberant brushwork, but they are also indicative of a distinctly masculine aesthetic in his work, which combines a ’brutal‘ handling of paint with images of men’s bodies, particularly those defined by physical labour (longshoremen) and violence (boxers). A similar use of masculine terminology to describe painting technique would occur again in the 1950s with Abstract Expressionism, and Bellows might be seen as an early forerunner of the movement.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bellows was hailed ‘the Millet of the stevedores,’ and his depiction of working people had precedents in French art. But it is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Courbet</a> rather than Millet who is the precursor here – his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Burial at Ornans</span> of 1849–50 (Musée d’Orsay, Paris), especially, is perhaps distantly reflected in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Men of the Docks</span>. Courbet sought to create a French popular art, and Bellows’s focus on contemporary everyday subjects was often framed in nationalist terms. The artistic influences may have been French but, following Robert Henri’s example, this is distinctly American imagery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When bought by the National Gallery in 2014, this was the first major American painting to enter the collection. Its purchase signalled a broadening of the Gallery’s remit from collecting European paintings to collecting paintings in the ‘European tradition’.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around 200 of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a>’s works depict male and female nude bathers, either singly or in groups, in a landscape. The  earliest dates from the 1870s. This large painting is one of three pictures of female bathers that Cezanne worked on during the final decade of his life. The largest of all his paintings, they represent the culmination of his lifelong investigation of this subject and the climax of his entire career. They were hugely influential on early twentieth-century modern art, particularly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cubism</a>, and had a lasting impact on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Picasso</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Matisse</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The precise dating of the pictures is difficult. It’s possible that Cezanne worked simultaneously on all three canvases, beginning in the mid-1890s and continuing until his death in 1906, as each shows evidence of reworking. The first of the three, possibly begun in 1895 and of a similar size to the National Gallery’s picture, is now in the Barnes Foundation, Philadelphia. The National Gallery’s painting is generally acknowledged to be the second to have been started. It may date from 1898–9 and was finished in 1905. As he worked on the picture, Cezanne decided to reduce the area of sky and folded the top of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> over the stretcher on which it was mounted, which only became apparent when the picture was re-stretched long after his death. The third picture is now in the Philadelphia Museum of Art and relates most closely to the work in the National Gallery. Perhaps painted relatively quickly in the last months of Cezanne’s life, it was left unfinished with areas of canvas still showing through.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">All three pictures draw upon a classical tradition of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM8-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastoral</a> scenes of nude or semi-nude figures in an idealised landscape, which extended from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> to artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> and Renoir. More particularly, they recall paintings of bathing nymphs and pagan goddesses, especially sixteenth-century Venetian mythological scenes such as Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GYK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Actaeon</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H6Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Callisto</a></span>. However, Cezanne’s paintings have no mythological narrative or literary source, nor are any men present. The locations are unspecified, although the landscapes recall Provence, where Cezanne lived.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Of the three paintings, the National Gallery’s is arguably the strongest and simplest in composition. It is also the most fully painted and richly coloured. We are looking at a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>-like group of 11 nude women relaxing in a woodland glade beneath an azure sky. The picture does not include the water in which the women bathe. Placed before them is a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a> and a black dog. Several of the women have their backs towards us, and their faces are either mask-like or turned away. Filling the foreground, most of them lean in towards the middle of the picture. The strong diagonals of their bodies form the base of a pyramid that has echoes of Mont Sainte-Victoire overlooking Aix-en-Provence (where Cezanne was born), which the artist painted numerous times. Although each woman is distinct, they also form a single, almost sculptural mass. Throughout the picture, space is flattened and compressed. Cezanne has not used the conventions of atmospheric recession to create, for example, an effect of a distant sky that becomes paler towards the horizon – indeed, the blue here becomes darker nearest the clouds. The brilliant blue of the sky is as intense as other areas of the picture, and Cezanne has undone perspective by making the sky and clouds as substantial as the earth, trees and women.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Touches of blue are repeated throughout the picture. These not only represent dappled light, but contrast with warmer areas of orange, yellow and ochre. Blue also integrates the women with their surroundings, particularly through Cezanne’s use of a broken blue outline, reinforced by black, around each of them. These bodies are not physically separate from the landscape, but are part of it. This merging is especially apparent in the standing woman on the far left of the group. Her pale skin contains emphatic slashes of blue (for example, on her thigh), but her head is dark, its earthy tones close to the grey-brown tree trunk behind it. The diagonal line of that tree is repeated by her left leg, back and neck, just as the line of her right thigh is mirrored by her right forearm and the almost square top of her right shoulder. These lines, particularly the diagonal of her leg and right angle of her arm, are reiterated in the outline of the larger woman seated on the ground to her right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cezanne’s often crude distortions of the body may in part be the result of his awkwardness in figure drawing. He also admitted to the painter Emile Bernard that he was too shy to hire models when working on these pictures, relying instead on memories from visits to museums and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0008-0000-0000.htm">academic</a> studies of his youth. But these distortions also give the women an architectural quality that harmonises with their surroundings, as seen most obviously in the standing woman on the left. As solid as the ground they lie upon, the women become one with the landscape they inhabit. Cezanne’s last paintings might perhaps be seen as his final celebration of nature and as an idyllic, even utopian, vision of our union with it.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Women combing their hair, or having it combed, often appear in Degas’s work – for example, in his early <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GIJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Beach Scene</a></span>, also in the National Gallery. This late painting is one of his boldest treatments of the subject.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, a maid, wearing her servant’s uniform, combs the hair of her seated mistress, who is not yet fully dressed and who may also be pregnant. Pulled back by the force of the strokes, the mistress raises her right hand to her head as if in pain, or perhaps just to steady herself or hold her hair in place.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas may originally have used his own maid, Zoé Closier, who he also photographed, as a model for the maid in his preparatory drawings. However, he replaced her with the woman we see here who, like the mistress, was most likely a professional model. Degas’s choice of this subject in part reflects his interest in Japanese woodblock prints, which he collected, as they often show women engaged in everyday domestic activities. But a more immediate precedent was Ingres’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Turkish Bath</span> (1862–3, Louvre, Paris), in which a seated woman, seen in profile, has her hair plaited by another who stands behind her. A keen admirer of Ingres, Degas was very familiar with this painting, and defended it against its critics.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The principal colours of Degas’s picture are limited to variations of a fiery orange-red painted over a creamy white <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> that is still visible on the left of the canvas. In other areas, such as to the right of the curtain, you can also see traces of grey-black underpainting. Degas relieves the intensity of the orange-reds by introducing other tonally related colours such as the yellow comb and brush and the maid’s pink blouse. His use of colour is not naturalistic or descriptive but has an expressive, perhaps even symbolic, dimension, which gives an ordinary domestic scene a feeling of almost claustrophobic intensity. Perhaps the red is metaphor for the pain or discomfort felt by the mistress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the picture shows Degas’s great skill in using colour, drawing remains paramount. He sketches in the composition, and also adds final details (for example, in the mistress’s face) with swift, bold strokes of black paint containing charcoal. He structures the image by creating a powerful diagonal, which runs down from the maid’s head and arm along the length of her mistress’s body. The standing maid also creates a vertical on the right that is complemented on the picture’s left by the upward line of the curtain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some areas are more defined than others – the objects on the table, for example, look unfinished. Degas probably planned to work further on the painting, as he enlarged it by placing it on a bigger stretcher. However, we can only guess what he intended, as it was never completed and remained in his studio. Two years after his death, the painting was bought by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Henri Matisse</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p>In December 1898 Hammershøi moved into the old merchant house at Strandgade 30, Copenhagen, built in 1636. This painting portrays one of its rooms, and the model is his wife Ida, whom he married in 1891. The table was originally larger and filled most of the foreground, and the figure was added at the end. Pencil underdrawing is visible through the paint layer.<br/><br/>The artist painted the interior of this house more than sixty times, sometimes portraying empty rooms, sometimes including the figure of his wife in a long black dress. She is either viewed in profile or from the back, often reading a letter or a book. In all the interiors a sense of stillness prevails, and they show the influence of 17th-century Dutch painting, particularly that of <a href="/artists/johannes-vermeer">Johannes Vermeer</a>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Born in 1884 in Mulhouse (then annexed to the German Empire as part of Alsace-Lorraine), Greta Moll was a sculptor and her German husband, Oskar Moll, a painter. Both were enrolled in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Matisse</a>’s art school, which he opened in 1908. Among the earliest collectors of Matisse, the Molls were to create the finest collection of his work in Germany. Greta had previously been a student in Berlin, where she studied with the German artist Lovis Corinth, who had painted her portrait in 1907. On being shown a photograph of the portrait, which he disliked, Matisse offered to paint his own portrait of her for 1000 francs – but with no obligation to buy if she and her husband were dissatisfied with it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the apparent simplicity and directness of this portrait, Greta had to pose for ten three-hour sessions before Matisse completed it. He decided early on to use the blue and white toile de Jouy patterned fabric as a background because it provided ‘a wonderful grandeur’. This cotton print became a favourite studio prop and appears in many of Matisse’s paintings from this period, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Dessert: Harmony of Red</span> (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg), also painted in 1908. The distinctive fabric also determined the final choice of colours for the entire painting. As Greta’s head is enveloped by bold swirls of blue, Matisse kept altering the colours of her blouse and skirt which at one time were lavender-white and green. In the finished painting, Matisse, following the example of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Seurat</a>, deliberately placed pure colours next to each other for maximum effect – for example, the warm reddish-brown of Greta’s hair complements the cooler blue of the fabric. That red is repeated below her right forearm and contrasts with the green line above it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was painted just three years after the 1905 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> d’Automne in Paris, when Matisse and his associates were dubbed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Les Fauves</span> (‘the wild beasts’) for their near discordant colours applied in frenetic brushstrokes and their use of broken lines. Here, however, although he was still committed to creating intense colour effects, Matisse was striving to maintain expressive unity. He was seeking to reconcile the need to paint a recognisable portrait with that of creating a self-contained composition with its own internal harmony.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Matisse looked at other paintings in an attempt to resolve the problem. In a statement made in the 1940s, he commented on how he was ‘nearly completely discouraged’ by his inability to capture Greta’s ’statuesque quality‘, but that he knew of ’a portrait of similar character‘ in the Louvre. That portrait was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Woman and Child with a Dog</span> (1565–70). Matisse wanted to give his portrait of Greta the same ’grandeur' he saw in the Veronese and he viewed the pose and smooth, rounded forearms of Veronese’s sitter as providing a key to resolving his own portrait. But Greta’s heavy forearms, especially her right arm, also have an echo of the languid, seemingly boneless arms of Ingres’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D8J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Madame Moitessier</a></span>. Much of Ingres’s portrait is also taken up with the prominent display of a floral-patterned fabric.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In spite of his difficulties in completing the portrait, Matisse was pleased with the final painting and he entered it for the Salon d’Automne of 1908. He also used it for one of the six illustrations in his widely circulated theoretical statement, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Notes of a Painter</span> (1908), which Greta translated for publication in Germany the following year.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A bunch of flowers in a ceramic vase is displayed on a table. The flowery tablecloth is decorated with prominent blue stripes which suggest a recession into depth and compensate for the rather flat background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like most of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monticelli</a>’s work, this picture is painted on a wood panel, part of which has been left visible and acts as a mid-tone. Thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impastoed</a> paint, typical of his late style, has been used to delineate the flowers and to model their forms as well as describe their colour. The brushstrokes sometimes move in opposite directions, and blobs of pure colour suggest the petals. This painting is related to other Monticelli still lifes in the Gallery’s collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still Life: Oysters, Fish</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EA6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still Life: Fruits</a></span>. These pictures feature the same tablecloth and were probably painted about the same time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monticelli was highly regarded by his contemporaries, and his long-term friendship with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a> is well known and documented. However, it is his influence on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> which is perhaps most notable. The Dutch painter saw Monticelli’s work for the first time in Paris in 1886. On that occasion he purchased one of his flower pieces, a painting (now in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam) which is very similar to this one. Soon afterwards he went to Provence, where Monticelli had worked, and in 1890 Vincent and his brother Theo were involved in publishing the first-ever book on Monticelli. These experiences proved very important for the evolution of Van Gogh’s unique style and technique.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Monticelli’s work tends to be overlooked by scholars today, it seems to have paved the way for the technical and stylistic development of some of the most important Post-Impressionist artists.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting previously formed part of a collection belonging to Mr Harry Wearne. It was presented to the Tate in 1939, ten years after Wearne’s death, together with 11 other works by Monticelli. This group of pictures was eventually transferred to the National Gallery in 1956.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the mid-1920s, after his break with the Dada and Surrealist movements, Picabia began a series of paintings known as ‘Transparencies’. In these esoteric, dreamlike compositions, Picabia layers fragments from an eclectic array of sources – classical myth, medieval Catalan frescoes, Old Master paintings and contemporary photography – to give the impression of disparate images superimposed upon each other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Picabia painted <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Salome</span>, a work dense with quotation, in the middle of this period. The story of Salome itself is biblical: the stepdaughter of King Herod, Salome demands the head of Saint John the Baptist on a platter and dances in exchange for her wish, becoming a cultural icon of seductive female power. Her lithe figure in Picabia’s painting derives from a 1925 photograph of a ballet dancer, Claire Baruoff, taken by Austrian photographer Trude Fleischmann, while the oversized face was probably based on Botticelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ the Redeemer</span> (about 1495–1505, National Gallery of Australia), in which a thorned and tearful Christ raises his hand in blessing. Rather than copying from original works, Picabia took from reproductions, much as he had previously made tracings of figures instead of painting models directly. The effect of this process is akin to that of collage – a key tool of the Dadaists, who valued the improvised and unexpected collision of disconnected images.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite their well-established reference points, the ‘Transparencies’ are full of a personal, hermetic codes which resist conventional interpretation. Picabia’s juxtapositions are anti-systematic, driven less by clear reasoning than intuitive association. For the artist, the works express ‘the resemblance of my interior desires,’ the outcome of an ambition to produce paintings ‘where all my instincts have a free course.’ Such is the alchemical logic of the ‘Transparencies’ that they often produce an occult, hallucinatory result. Yet the theme of desire does appear to be central in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Salome</span>: alongside Salome’s nude figure, the heavy-lidded eyes and half-parted lips of Picabia’s androgynous riff on Botticelli’s Christ imply a latent sensuality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Picabia simplifies the forms of these overlapping images, painting in a graphic style with strong, sinuous lines. The ‘Transparencies’’ lack of recessional space, and their simultaneity of different images, led Marcel Duchamp to note that these works produce ‘a third dimension without resorting to perspective.’ Although the medium of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Salome</span> is oil paint, it bears a remarkable filmy quality, which Picabia achieved by using thin washes, applying varnish to create layers, and effacing and repainting parts of the canvas. In keeping with his highly modern – even proto-postmodern – aesthetic strategies, the artist also painted Salome with a distinct patina, imitating the sepia-toned veneer of a work discoloured by age. Such self-reflexivity – painting not only versions of other paintings, but also pastiching their material surfaces – marks <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Salome</span> as an intellectual work as much as it is a phantasmagorical one.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Picabia, who was notoriously capricious with his pictorial methods, abandoned the ‘Transparencies’ only a few years later in 1932.</p></div>

The model has been identified as Germaine (Laure) Florentin, mistress of Picasso’s Catalan friend Carles Casagemas who committed suicide in February 1901 following the failure of their relationship. The painting was long dated to 1903 until sold in a widely noted public auction in New York in the late 1950s when Picasso himself informed the author of his catalogue raisonné, Christian Zervos, that it had been painted two years earlier.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Staring straight at us while nonchalantly holding a cigarette is the Hungarian-born art dealer Joseph Brummer (1883‒1947). The portrait was painted a few months before the opening of his gallery in Montparnasse; the cultural hub of Paris. Exuding a certain confidence, the portrait is fit for a young entrepreneur like Brummer. His gallery dealt mainly in African works of art and paintings by Henri Rousseau. Brummer was one of Rousseau’s most dedicated advocates and patrons, commissioning the portrait from his friend in 1909.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pioneering Rousseau enjoyed only a few years of critical acclaim. Formerly a customs clerk – hence his often-used nickname <span class="dokuwiki_italic">‘Le Douanier’</span> – he was completely self-taught, taking up painting only in 1883. His primitive works often show elaborate jungle scenes, boasting a vast array of animals and brightly coloured vegetation. His 1891 work <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Surprised!</a></span>, also in the National Gallery Collection, is a remarkable example of Rousseau’s characteristic jungle scenes and depicts a startled tiger in a dense forest. Rousseau often visited the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Jardin des Plantes</span> in Paris, where he found inspiration in the tropical flora and the caged (wild) animals. Here, he invented his imaginary dreamscapes, composing his jungles from the Botanical Gardens and an array of taxidermy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young Joseph Brummer is pictured in a red velvet covered, wicker chair. His hands are placed casually on the armrests of his throne-like seat, with his feet firmly on the ground. He is positioned partly on a sandy path and partly on the grass. Four trees can be seen behind Brummer, in between smaller, more densely leaved bushes. The greenery consists of two layers of leafy plants, leaving space for the ridge of mountains visible in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rousseau constructed the painting in his characteristic <span class="dokuwiki_italic">portrait-landscape</span> genre. As a self-taught artist copying works in the Louvre, it is possible that Rousseau had been inspired by the landscapes in early Italian portraiture, of which the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mona Lisa</span> is a famous example. Rousseau approached the painting’s background layers (in this case, the dense bushes, the four trees and the faraway mountains), as individual elements. In doing so, he plays with the conventional concept of perspective, creating space through the distinct layers of jungle. Even though he was regarded as a pioneer of ‘naïve’ art – referring to his lack of formal education – his understanding of compositional awareness shows his sophisticated and deliberate approach to painting. Rousseau often used his backdrops as a device to hint at his sitter’s identity. The mountains in the background of Brummer’s portrait may suggest the hills of Brummer’s hometown of Zombor (modern-day Serbia).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When Rousseau presented his work <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Hungry Lion Throws Himself on the Antelope</span> (Fondation Beyeler, Basel) at the 1905 Salon d’Automne, it was greatly appreciated by his former critics. The work prompted a group of admirers to form around the artist during his later years. Unsurprisingly, the appreciation of Rousseau by younger Avant-gardists coincided with the popularisation of African works of art. Rousseau had a profound influence on the next generation of Modernists, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pablo Picasso</a> and Robert Delaunay. As one of his most devout admirers, Brummer held on to his Rousseau works as long as he could. Unfortunately, due to financial troubles, he had to part with his beloved portrait. Brummer sold it to the German art collector, dealer and critic Wilhelm Uhde, who would later publish the first monograph on Rousseau a year after the artist’s death, in 1911.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A tiger crouches low in thick jungle foliage, its back arched and teeth bared. It is not entirely clear what is happening, however. Is the tiger cowering in response to the flash of lightning in the upper right corner, or is it, as is more likely, stalking prey?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rousseau</a> reworked the canvas, and the darkened areas just above the tall grasses on the right may be traces of prey that was subsequently removed. Several contemporary reviews of the painting mention prey being hunted, and Rousseau himself later referred to the picture as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Tiger Chasing Explorers</span>. The title may even be a play on the French phrase ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">grève surprise’</span> (lightning strike), linking the tiger’s imminent leap with the simultaneous bolt of lightning. The ambiguity adds an element of mystery to the painting, which may well have been Rousseau’s intention.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was the first of around 20 ‘jungle’ paintings that Rousseau produced during his career. These pictures gave an aura of exoticism to both Rousseau and his art in his lifetime, and they continue to be among his most popular works. Rousseau’s jungles are entirely imaginary, as he never left France. He spent four years in the army from 1863, but his claim that he had served with a French expeditionary force in Mexico in the early 1860s had no basis. The plants, painted in precise detail, are a mixture of domestic house plants and tropical varieties, which he had seen at the Jardin des Plantes (Botanical Gardens) in Paris. Run by the Natural History Museum, the Gardens included a dilapidated zoo (that nonetheless housed lions, tigers and jaguars) and new Zoology Galleries. These Galleries had been built for the 1889 Paris World Fair and included a large collection of stuffed animals in ‘lifelike’ poses. Entry to the Botanical Gardens was free, and Rousseau was a frequent visitor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This composition is more complex and full of action than any of Rousseau’s previous paintings. It is one of his most meticulously worked pictures, with a richly patterned surface made up of dense layers of foliage and vegetation rendered in greens, reds and russet browns, that covers almost the entire canvas. Rousseau worked by completing sections of the canvas in sequence. He also used a pantograph (a mechanical enlarger) that enabled him to trace the outlines of a projected image or object directly onto the canvas. This may explain why the tiger appears awkwardly suspended in space rather than being firmly placed on the ground. With the outlines in place, Rousseau then filled in the design with oil paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He covered the completed picture with a mesh of semi-transparent silver-grey stripes to represent rain, which echo the tiger’s stripes and the long blades and leaves. This method of painting rain is similar to Japanese woodblock prints, such as Hiroshige’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sudden Shower over Shin-Ōhashi Bridge and Atake</span>, which was published in 1857 as part of his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">One Hundred Famous Views of Edo</span>. Rousseau may have known these prints, as Japanese woodblocks circulated widely in Europe, and were collected by French artists. The tiger itself is a composite of stuffed specimens, zoological and magazine illustrations and the domestic cat. Rousseau may also have seen images of tigers by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eugène Delacroix</a> and Jean-Léon Gérôme, which were often reproduced in prints and photographs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rousseau was a self-taught amateur artist – a ‘Sunday’ painter – who took up painting as a hobby, claiming he had ‘no teacher other than nature.’ His job at the Paris Customs Office was the source of his nickname, ‘Douanier’ (customs inspector), although he never in fact made the rank of inspector. His lack of knowledge of perspective is evident in the flatness and lack of three-dimensional modelling in his paintings. However, Rousseau took his painting very seriously, despite facing ridicule from some quarters. A number of artist and writers, particularly from the avant-garde, hailed him as an important figure. Among these was the young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pablo Picasso</a>, who not only bought a portrait by Rousseau but who also, in December 1908, organised a ceremonial banquet in his honour, which was attended by many of Paris’s leading cultural figures. Addressing Picasso at the banquet, Rousseau asserted, ‘You and I are the two most important artists of the age – you in the Egyptian style, and I in the modern one.’ Today, Rousseau is regarded as a pioneer of ‘naïve art’, a term used to describe art produced by artists with no formal artistic training. Its childlike simplicity and sometimes crude technique are often seen as a sign of its authenticity of expression.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Surprised!</span> was exhibited at the Salon des Indépendants of 1891. Established in Paris in 1884 under the slogan, ‘without jury nor reward’, the Salon des Indépendants was a response to the narrow traditionalism of the official, government-sponsored <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PUT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Odilon Redon</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Georges Seurat</a> and Paul Signac were among its founder members, and Rousseau would regularly exhibit at its annual show. His submission of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Surprised!</span> to the 1891 Salon prompted the first serious critical response to his work. Writing in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Swiss Journal</span>, a young writer and artist, Félix Vallotton, had no doubts concerning Rousseau’s earnestness or his ability: ‘His tiger … ought not to be missed: it is the alpha and omega of painting … As a matter of fact, not everyone laughs, and some who do are quickly brought up short. There is always something beautiful about seeing a faith, any faith, so pitilessly expressed. For my part, I have sincere esteem for such efforts, and I would a hundred times rather them than the deplorable mistakes nearby.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Five drinkers gather in the shadowy depths of a tavern in Zarauz, the Basque coastal town where the Spanish painter Joaquín Sorolla spent the summer of 1910. One, more drunk than the others, stares through watery eyes at the artist. Sorolla understood the man’s name to be Moscorra but, as the word means drunkard in the Basque language, he may have misunderstood something the locals told him. To Moscorra’s right a man pushes a glass of cider towards him, egging on the inebriate to further excess. A younger man throws a threatening glance towards  the painter so that cruel fun is heightened by suspicion and menace.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is a large-scale, improvisatory and rapidly executed sketch. Paint is applied in relatively thin layers while light and shadow are precisely evoked with bold sweeps of the brush. The canvas edges abruptly cut off two figures at upper left and right; adept in photographic technique from youth, Sorolla here exploits the haphazard spontaneity of an amateur’s awkward snapshot. This is one of a half dozen such impromptu tavern scenes he painted that summer, several featuring Moscorra, as Sorolla confronted the problem of alcoholism among the Spanish underclasses, and the baleful role taverns played in their lives. Particularly satisfied with it, Sorolla chose to include <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Drunkard</span> in his second major American exhibition, at the Art Institute of Chicago in 1911.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture marks a turning point in Sorolla’s career. For the first time in ten years he again took up a dark theme. Throughout the previous decade he had depicted carefree urchins and elegant, carefree women and children of the upper middle class on sun-dappled beaches; such beguiling images had served to establish his international fame and considerable fortune. Around 1910, however, Archer Milton Huntington, the founder of the Hispanic Society of America, offered Sorolla the commission to paint a monumental cycle on the peoples and customs of the artist’s homeland. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Vision of Spain</span> would be installed in the Society’s New York headquarters in 1926, four years after Sorolla’s death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Vision of Spain</span> presented a dual challenge. Sorolla would need to depict peasants in the sometimes grim reality of their lives and, speaking to an international audience, he was called on to exploit signifiers of Spanish art he had used only sparingly in the past decade, not least the blacks, greys and browns of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velazquez’s</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Goya’s</a> palettes. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Drunkard</span> shows the artist with a new sense of purpose gearing up to take on the challenges his commission posed. He identified a theme representative of Basque peasant life. He entered wholeheartedly into the troubled world of Moscorra where he and the drunkard exchange direct gazes. He set himself a complicated visual and psychological challenge to paint quickly, in low light, and to capture unsparingly the fetid air of a peasant dive. Here, Sorolla created one of his saddest works: a penetrating assessment of mockery, cruelty and addiction at the lower depths which is at the same time a bravura exercise in passionate and compassionate observation.</p></div>

His friends Jos and Lucy Hessel rented the house for the summers of 1905, 1906 and 1907.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A posy of wild flowers on the marble mantelpiece sits alongside a number of bottles, artworks tucked behind them. Another picture hangs on the wall, far above the painting rags that are hanging up to dry. The richly decorated walls compete with the still-life arrangement on the mantelpiece. Despite this interplay between the two-dimensional and the three-dimensional, the foreshortened mantelpiece, which appears to jut out of the picture, marks the artist’s move to a more naturalistic approach.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the reverse of the painting there is a rapid sketch of three figures – a woman and two children – on a beach. The woman crouches down to pet one of the two dogs sat beside her.</p></div>
