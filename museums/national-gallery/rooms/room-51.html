        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small painting shows how Antonello revolutionised Venetian portraiture in the late fifteenth century: the three-quarter pose, dark background and strong lighting are all innovations from Northern Europe which focus attention entirely on the man’s face.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello’s skill at painting in oil enabled him to mimic the very precise painting style of northern masters like van Eyck, whose works were highly sought after in Venice where he travelled around the time this picture was made. By building up colour through layers of varied shades he was able to emphasise the volume and contours of the face using colour, rather than harsh lines. The glossiness of the oil paint adds shine to the man’s eyes so they look as if they are catching the light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These techniques made Antonello’s portraits vivid, intense and lifelike. His successful formula for painting portraits was quickly adopted by his contemporaries.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was once thought to be a self portrait, a mistake that probably arose from the misreading of an inscription on its original frame.  But the man’s gaze is so serious that he might be taken for an artist examining his reflection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello</a>’s portraiture achieved a level of intensity that had not been seen before this time in Italy. Only 12 of his portraits survive and all have the same format: the sitters – all men – are depicted bust length (head and shoulders only, so they look like a sculpted portrait bust), placed against dark backgrounds and lit by a strong, cool light. All the images are tightly cropped and the sitters stare directly at the viewer. With all possible distraction removed, only the sitter’s face and expression are available for interpretation, inviting us to focus on their character rather than outward shows of status or wealth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello adopted this format from paintings made in Flanders – a key example of the type is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D41-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Eyck’s self portrait</a>, made in 1433. Antonello was a native of Sicily, and it has been suggested that his knowledge of the painting of the Low Countries and his skill in using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> were developed through training he received there, and that he introduced the medium to Venice when he travelled there in 1475.  This is highly unlikely: oil paint was being used in northern Italy earlier in the fifteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello seems to have refined his technique while in Venice, as he adopted the oil paint medium wholeheartedly along with his Venetian contemporaries. His pictures are distinctive for the way they imitate the precision and refinement of works by Netherlandish artists that were hugely popular in Venice. Oil paint enabled him to portray a range of textures – its sheen conveys the glossiness of the man’s large eyes, for example – and he also scraped through the paint to achieve the effect of having painted individual hairs on the man’s head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lighter paint has been used to suggest light catching the tip of the man’s nose and his sharp cheekbones; the underside of his chin and the left side of his jaw are cast in shadow. In between these extremes of light and shade are numerous mid-tones that make these transitions subtle and naturalistic. There are no harsh lines between the palest part of his skin, under his right eye, and the area just above it, beneath his eyebrow. By varying the tones in this subtle way, Antonello achieves a three-dimensional effect where the head appears to emerge from the darkness of the background. This technique was adopted by many other Venetian portraitists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q25-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alvise Vivarini</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This apparently simple portrait of a young man was revolutionary in Italian painting. Until this moment, artists painted people either in profile view, so only half their face was visible, or by turning them three-quarters to face the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, Botticelli paints the boy head on, mapping his whole face – the fleshy nose, dimpled cheeks, warm brown eyes and determined, protruding chin.

His features are individual but his overall look resembles Botticelli’s idealised males, particularly Mars in his painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Mars</span>, also in the National Gallery’s collection. Renaissance portraits often beautified their subjects because outward beauty was supposed to reflect inner virtue: the portrait was an eternal witness to the person’s soul as well as their appearance.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait of a young man was revolutionary when it was painted. The man’s dress – a plain brown doublet lined or edged with fur – is tied with cords at the neck; his red cap is similar to the one worn in Antonello da Messina’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>. The two portraits also share plain dark backgrounds, and close and detailed observation of the features made possible by the strong lighting from the left. These elements are features of Northern European, specifically Netherlandish, portraiture. This was very fashionable in late fifteenth-century Florence, partly because members of the large Florentine community in the trading city of Bruges returned home with portraits of themselves made by northern painters, inspiring artists and patrons alike.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Before this trend for the northern style of portraiture emerged, Italian portraits were mostly in profile, showing only half the face. Painters like van Eyck, who worked in Bruges, were turning their subjects to face the viewer – a view we now take for granted – as you can see in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man (‘Léal Souvenir’)</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)</span>. Italian painters began to pick up on this as it offered a more direct communication with the viewer. Botticelli has gone one step further: he shows the boy head-on, his shoulders parallel with the picture’s horizontal edges.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Until this point the frontal view had been reserved for a particular kind of image of Christ. These were copies of the so-called Sudarium, the veil on which Christ wiped his face on the way to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> and which had been miraculously imprinted with his face. The veil was thought to reveal Christ’s humanity and divinity – his physical and spiritual presence. As such, it became the new model for secular portraits that were intended not only to record, convey and preserve the sitter’s appearance but also to act as memorials for their souls after their death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both aspects of the man are portrayed in this portrait, through the detailed record of his features and the idealisation of his features. The young man looks like the handsome and athletic gods in some of Botticelli’s mythological paintings, particularly Mars in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DE1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venus and Mars (NG915)</a></span>, sharing his curly hair, strong bone structure and fleshy features. He has a rounded nose, dimpled cheeks and a prominent chin. Idealisation was an important aspect of Renaissance portraiture. Renaissance writers and thinkers were influenced by the ancient Greek ideas about appearance and its meaning. One philosopher, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TIK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marsilio Ficino</a>, wrote in 1469 that internal perfection produces the external; in other words, outer beauty was a sign of inner virtue. As a lasting memorial to the sitter, Botticelli intended to show that this youth is both good and beautiful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When this picture was first purchased by the National Gallery, it was thought to be a self portrait by the Florentine artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q94-0001-0000-0000.htm">Masaccio</a>, who was working in the decades before Botticelli, mainly on frescoes and large-scale altarpieces. This idea seems unusual now because we do not know of any portraits by Masaccio and because a self portrait by an artist in this period would have been highly unusual: artists did not generally begin to paint self portraits until the following century. The theory might have developed because the close-up view that focuses on the boy’s face is so direct and unassuming, or because he appears so at ease while being painted. The picture is now agreed to be by Botticelli, but the identity of the youth remains a mystery.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portable <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> is one of a handful of English panel paintings to have survived from the Middle Ages. It was made for the private use of Richard II, King of England from 1377 to 1399, probably in the last five years of his life. It combines religious and secular imagery to embody his personal conception of kingship and his concerns with family and status.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young King, sumptuously dressed, kneels in a barren landscape. He is accompanied by three saints: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>, carrying the Lamb of God; <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Edward the Confessor</a>, holding a ring; and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Edmund</a> with the arrow of his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a> in his hand. The saints present the King to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>. They stand in a flowery meadow surrounded by angels, one of whom carries a white standard with a red cross. The richness of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">tempera</a> paintwork, the meticulously stamped gilding and the refinement of detail is extraordinary. The infant Christ is wrapped in cloth of gold, and stippled within his halo is a crown of thorns and three nails – symbols of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The imagery may seem conventional but it was intensely personal to Richard. He was deeply devoted to all three saints, who were central to his idea of sacred kingship: Edmund and Edward were England’s patron saints and former kings; John the Baptist announced the coming of the Messiah. Richard owned relics of the saint, and had prayers said at his altar in Westminster Abbey. It is notable that the three saints are shown in the order in which their chapels are located in the choir of  the Abbey, where Richard was crowned as a ten-year-old boy, and where he was buried. The arrangement of the three kings before the Virgin and Child also calls to mind the  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a>. The feast of the Epiphany had a special place in the liturgical life of all medieval royal courts, but especially so for Richard, as it fell on 6 January, his birthday.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the outside of the right wing, the English royal arms are impaled with those of Edward the Confessor. On the outside of the left wing, a white hart or stag, chained and with a crown around its neck, lies on a bed of flowers. The hart was Richard’s own badge, and the flowers include rosemary and ferns, emblems of his first wife Anne, as well as the irises and pimpernels of his second wife, Isabelle of France. On the inside of the left wing, Richard wears a jewel of the white hart painted to resemble white enamel over gold, pearls decorating its antlers, and a magnificent collar of gold broomcods (seeds of the broom plant). His red and gold robe is patterned with harts and rosemary, encircled with broomcods. White harts and broomcod collars are also worn by the angels on the right wing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Richard probably inherited the white hart from the white hind or doe used by his mother, but it may also be a pun on his name (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Richart</span> in French). In this period, it was customary for the badges of kings and nobles to be worn by their friends and followers. Richard’s jewel may resemble one with pearls on its antlers given to him by his second wife, while the hart badges worn by the angels in the right wing show that they are Richard’s supporters. The broomcods, known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">planta genista</span> in Latin, play on his family name of Plantagenet, but they were also the livery of Charles VI, King of France, Richard’s father-in-law. They were probably adopted by Richard after his marriage: a gold broomcod collar was among the gifts given by Charles to Richard when he handed over his six-year old daughter to her new husband.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Other aspects of the painting are more puzzling. Richard is shown as a beardless youth, even though the diptych is generally dated to the late 1390s, when he was a grown man. Technical analysis has shown that his head was painted in at a late stage. Does Richard appear as he looked when he was crowned at the age of ten? Richard was fascinated by crowns and coronations and the air of magic they gave to monarchy, transforming an ordinary human into a divinely appointed king. His crown is dotted with white lead <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> in imitation of pearls, as are the crowns of Edmund and Edward: Richard shows himself as a holy king in the tradition of the two royal English saints. Equally enigmatic is the red and white banner, and the gestures of both Christ and Richard. Is Christ blessing the monarch or the standard, and is Richard giving the standard to the Virgin and Child or receiving it from them? Why is the Virgin holding the sole of her son’s foot between thumb and forefinger? The standard itself has been interpreted as referring to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>, but at the time was probably understood first and foremost as that of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint George</a>, which was carried by all English soldiers going into battle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the top of the staff sits a tiny orb showing an island with green trees and a white tower, set in a sea of silver leaf that is now flaked and tarnished. Together they represent England, which was thought to be under the special protection of the Virgin and was commonly referred to as her dowry. As well as the white hart badges, the angels wear chaplets of red and white roses (the red has faded). A chaplet of enamelled white and red roses was inventoried among Richard’s possessions and such items may well have been worn at his court. With red-gold hair resembling that of the King, the angels are surely meant as the English, as in a well-known medieval pun on the Angles (as in the Anglo-Saxons) and angels (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">angli</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">angeli</span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the diptych, Richard is offering England to the Virgin as her dowry in the shape of a standard. His hands are empty, as the infant Christ has taken the standard and passed it to an attendant angel. He raises his hand to bless the standard, or Richard, or both, while Richard holds his hands out to receive it back in a gesture of feudal exchange. The Virgin holds Christ’s foot for Richard to kiss in a gesture of feudal homage. This moment is the heart of the painting, confirming Richard’s belief in the sacred nature of his rule: the boy king will rule under the direct protection of the Virgin and Child.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this little altarpiece, made for his private use, Richard has himself shown as he wished to be seen, as the divinely appointed descendant of a line of saintly kings. By blessing the banner, Christ confirms Richard‘​s belief in the sacred nature of his rule, a belief which contributed to his unpopularity and eventual downfall.  We don’t know exactly how or where Richard used the diptych, but it might have been placed on the altar of a small chapel in Westminster Abbey – used by Richard for private prayer – or in that of the Order of the Garter at Windsor. He may have carried it from one chapel to another. He might even have had it with him when he was captured by the troops of his cousin, the future Henry IV, in 1399. He was forced to abdicate and then imprisoned by the new king, and later starved to death at Pontefract Castle, in West Yorkshire.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leonardo’s mysterious painting shows the Virgin Mary with Saint John the Baptist, Christ’s cousin, and an angel. All kneel to adore the infant Christ, who in turn raises his hand to bless them. They are crowded in a grotto overhung with rocks and dense with vegetation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was part of a large, elaborate altarpiece made for the church of San Francesco Grande, Milan to celebrate the Immaculate Conception of the Virgin Mary. It replaced a similar picture Leonardo made earlier (now in the Louvre, Paris).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leonardo has used innovative painting techniques to give the impression that the figures are emerging from the darkness of this shaded setting.  For example, he has blurred the edges of their forms to indicate the shadows that envelop them. The underdrawing (preliminary outlining of a composition) shows that he attempted a different design but later changed his mind so it is almost identical to the Louvre version.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>’s most mysterious and complex pictures. It’s a rare survival of one of his large-scale painted works, and a key example of many of the techniques and innovations with which he transformed Italian painting. Leonardo began his painting career in Florence, but in the early 1480s he offered his services to Milan’s ruling family, the Sforzas. While in Milan, he received the commission to paint <span class="dokuwiki_italic">‘The Virgin of the Rocks’</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was to be part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HCO-0001-0000-0000.htm">grand altarpiece</a> which included a large sculpture of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, probably placed above it. The chapel that the altarpiece was destined for was in the church of San Francesco Grande, a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> convent in Milan. The chapel belonged to the newly-formed confraternity of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Immaculate Conception</a> of the Virgin Mary and it was dedicated to this feast.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The notion of the Immaculate Conception, which emerged in the twelfth century, was highly controversial but championed by the Franciscans.  The idea was important because in order for Christ to be born without original sin (which passed from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam and Eve</a> for disobeying God), his mother, Mary, also had to be free of sin. The doctrine’s supporters argued that the Virgin had been conceived by God even before the creation of the world – and so before original sin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leonardo’s painting was commissioned shortly after the pope officially sanctioned celebration of the feast in 1477. The subject was still so new that there was no standard way of showing it, giving Leonardo free rein to create a new composition. He painted the Virgin, an infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a> – a gilded cross under his arm – and an angel, kneeling around Christ, a chubby cross-legged child. The three figures communicate with each other in silence while the angel acts as a heavenly witness to the scene. They are embedded in the landscape: foliage tickles Saint John’s knees and Christ’s toes, and rocks hem them in on all sides.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Writers who supported the Immaculate Conception defended their argument using biblical passages that expressed the pre-existence of divine Wisdom (later associated with the Virgin). One of these was a verse in which Wisdom says: ‘From the beginning and before the world, was I created, and unto the world to come I shall not cease to be’ (Ecclesiasticus 24:14). This might explain why Leonardo has placed the figures in a shady grotto, with views through the rocks to a watery landscape beyond. These primitive elements suggest the scene is set in the earliest moments of creation: the first verses of the biblical creation story tell of God creating the earth out of the watery deep. The rocks are shaped like rounded cones – they look as though they have just emerged from the depths of the earth, like volcanic eruptions. Their upward energy contrasts with the water’s stillness, the green of which suggests it is shallow, like a swamp. A haze over the water suggests its warmth – a fetid pool, ripe with the promise of life. The place is certainly fertile: the plants around Saint John the Baptist’s knees are firm and luscious, the leaves plump. Plants even sprout from the rocks above; the landscape is alive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this picture we see examples of many of Leonardo’s broad range of interests. His surviving drawings include numerous studies of nature: dramatic rock formations, trees and detailed plant studies. He was fascinated by the power of the natural world; he made nine drawings of an imaginary deluge, expressing the force of water. He paints the rocks of the holy grotto with immense attention to the detail of their texture; we can almost feel it ourselves under the infant Christ’s left hand. But the flowers don’t resemble any real flowers – they‘re hybrids of different plants.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leonardo has used his inventive technique, now called aerial perspective, to give the impression of a vast landscape setting. He realised that we perceive the same colours differently depending on their distance from us; green appears blue if viewed from far off. By painting the mountains in the background blue, he tricks us into believing they are in the far distance. He softened their edges so they appear hazy, another technique that mimics the effects of vision in reality. The cool blue-green also contrasts directly with the rich, warm red-brown of the earth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figures emerge softly from the darkness of the grotto. Leonardo created this effect by painting very subtle, rather than stark, transitions between light and dark. This created a blurry effect around the edges of forms – look at the Virgin’s temples and nose for example – a technique later called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sfumato</span>. As with ’aerial perspective', this idea was a result of his experiments into vision and perception in this period. Leonardo built up his figures using layers of black and white underpainting, showing his knowledge of the way we perceive shapes through the effect of light and shadow on their surfaces.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Recent conservation work has revealed that Leonardo painted this, his second version of the picture, in three phases. He probably started in the early 1490s, painting the angel’s delicate gauze sleeve. Technical examination shows that a few years later he changed the position of Christ’s head, turning it from a three-quarter to profile view. In 1499 he left Milan for Florence to escape the turbulence caused by the French invasion of the city. He was summoned to return to finish the picture in 1506, when he added a layer of ultramarine (an expensive blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>) to the sky – as specifically mentioned in the original contract.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Our panel, begun about a decade after the first version, has been painted in a significantly different style. Some areas appear to be unfinished if viewed up close, but this was probably deliberate: it enables us to focus on the most important features. There are fewer colours too – it is mainly blue, yellow and brown. Leonardo has changed the angel’s robes from red to blue, probably to simplify the picture and focus attention on the Virgin’s yellow draperies.</p></div>

He is being led away to be crucified. The Roman governor Pontius Pilate stands in the doorway behind Christ, while the Jewish high priests, who wanted him executed, look on from the windows. Christ has been crowned with thorns and his hands bound. The purple robe in which he was presented to the people during the trial has been taken from him, and he is wearing a blue tunic; this must be the seamless tunic mentioned in the Bible for which the Roman soldiers cast lots.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A motley crowd of soldiers preparing the Cross are watched by a weeping woman and her children. The artist was careful to emphasise differences in the spectators' reactions: the soldiers have exaggerated features and distorted expressions; one sticks his bottom in our faces as he leans over to lift up a pick from below the cross. In the background, the two criminals described as thieves who were executed alongside Christ have been stripped and bound.

Here the narrative begins in the top right-hand corner, in the garden of Gethsemane where Christ contemplates a chalice paced high on the cliff above him. He is asking ‘Let this cup pass from my lips’. The apostles <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Peter</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPM-0008-0000-0000.htm">James the Greater</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">John</a> are asleep nearby (Matthew 26: 36–46). <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a>, who had been a follower of Christ, here leads the Roman soldiers to arrest him; in the background on the left is his corpse – he later hanged himself from a tree (Matthew 27: 5).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the top section is the road to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FU8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Calvary</a>, which began in the left wing. The thieves, dressed in shirts, lead the procession. Christ is carrying his cross and behind him ride the Roman governor Pontius Pilate and the chief priests. In the distance is the tower of the New Church in Delft. The procession is watched from a distance by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and Saint John, accompanied by three women. The woman on the right, who reappears in the same clothes below the Cross and in the right wing, is presumably <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the foreground Christ hangs from the Cross and is mocked by two soldiers, one of whom carries a halberd and uses his fingers to stretch his mouth in a grimace. On Christ’s right is the ‘good thief’ Dismas; on his left the ‘bad thief’ Gesmas (Luke 23: 39–43). Below Dismas are Saint John, the fainting Virgin and four other grieving women, one of whom covers her face with a cloth and another of whom, directly behind the Virgin, was added at a late stage. Various women present at the Crucifixion are mentioned in the Gospels but it is not possible to identify them here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the lower left corner is the donor, wearing the white habit of a Premonstratensian canon. In the centre are two exotically dressed children, one of whom holds a bow; it seems to be the pair who, slightly differently dressed but still with a bow, watch Christ carrying the Cross. In the lower right corner is Pilate, accompanied by the chief priests. The grandly dressed man who appears in profile and seems to address Pilate may be the centurion who took charge of the executions and who believed in Christ’s divinity. Behind Pilate are two soldiers, one of whom carries a spear; he is perhaps Longinus, who pierced Christ’s side with his spear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis shows that there is extensive <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> for the main figures and prominent buildings, and that there were many changes between the underdrawing and the final painted version. Some figures were altered or even added during the painting phase: the woman below the good thief is drawn and painted on top of his cross and the landscape. The bare strip of wood around the edge would originally have been covered by the frame, now lost.</p></div>

When he returned it, an image of his face was imprinted upon it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sudarium, thought to be the only true portrait of Christ, became one of the holiest relics in the Catholic Church – Veronica’s name actually derives from the Latin phrase <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vera icon</span>, meaning ‘true image’. A sudarium thought to be Veronica’s is conserved in St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome. The legend of the sudarium inspired paintings like this, where Veronica holds up the miraculously imprinted cloth. This picture is very similar to one in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich that gives the anonymous painter his identity as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QI4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Master of Saint Veronica</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Munich painting is more elaborate and includes groups of angels with colourful wings seated on the ground. There are traces of the draperies and the wings of flying angels here, not painted but punched with little dots into the gold on either side of Veronica’s head, but they are now so worn they are barely visible. The Munich painting shows Christ with darker skin, common for images of this kind, but wearing a crown of thorns, which was borrowed from images of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows</a> that, by the fifteenth century, had begun to replace the more simple image of Christ depicted here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The design of the decorated border–created by indenting the gold leaf background with shaped tools – is the same in both paintings, which were probably made at around the same time in the 1420s. In our <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> both Christ and Veronica have gold haloes inscribed with their names in Latin, whereas in the Munich panel Christ’s head is surrounded by a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilded</a> cross. The surrounding decoration – most clearly visible in Christ’s halo – is detailed and delicate. This sensitivity to symmetry and graceful lines also features in the fine draping folds of Veronica’s mantle as it falls over her head, and in the gathered fabric at her neck, fastened with a pin.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture – known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Manchester Madonna</span>’ since 1857, when it was exhibited in the great Manchester Art Exhibition – is probably the earliest of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>’s surviving paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is unfinished – the black modelling of the Virgin’s cloak is without its coat of ultramarine blue, and the angels to the left were barely begun. We don‘t know why it was never completed. Michelangelo’s panel painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Entombment</a></span> of about 1500–1 was also left unfinished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits on a rock with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> and young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a> next to her. Her right breast is bare suggesting that she has just been feeding her child who reaches up to grasp the book she is holding. The book may be the Old Testament open at Isiah 53 which prophesies Christ’s future crucifixion as she seems to try to hold it away from him, as though she doesn’t want him to discover his destiny.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Angels stand on either side; those on the left are rendered by lines drawn in to mark out the folds of their clothes and by the areas of greenish underpainting traditionally used to balance the pinkish flesh tones that would be painted over them. This was the traditional, Central Italian way of painting in egg tempera which Michelangelo progressively abandoned as he matured. Saint John the Baptist in his camel skin coat appears to be steadying his cousin, Christ, who is balanced precariously with one foot on a fold of his mother’s cloak. John looks out of the painting maybe to suggest his role in preparing the way for Christ’s teaching. He is usually shown with a scroll inscribed ‘Ecce Agnus Dei’ (‘Behold the Lamb of God’), referring to Christ’s crucifixion. This may be the scroll held by the angels.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Michelangelo trained in Florence, where drawing and unified, convincing compositional design were paramount, in the studio of the painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>. Here he learned to draw his compositions out on paper before transferring them to the wall or panel. We can still see the lines of the angels' drapery where he has transferred his preparatory drawing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Because the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span> is unfinished, we can see in action the technique for painting in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">egg tempera</a>. It is most obvious in the hatched and cross-hatched brushstrokes of the black under-modelling on the Virgin’s cloak, which would be less visible if it were finished. Egg-based paints cannot be manipulated and blended on the surface of the painting and they dry rapidly, so they must be applied in hatched and stippled brushstrokes, and the different tones and values of colour required to show form, light and shadow have to be mixed in advance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paints are applied in sequence, with the darkest applied first and the highlight last. Because tempera paints are thin, the sequence has to be repeated again and again until the brushstrokes mesh and the tones appear to blend when seen from a reasonable distance. It is a long and painstaking process, but the picture reveals Michelangelo’s mastery of the technique. The downy feathers sprouting from the nearest angel’s back and the fluttering edges of the Christ Child’s tunic are very delicate effects that are difficult to achieve in egg tempera.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite this, the execution reveals Michelangelo’s training as a sculptor. He learned to sculpt at the Florentine court of Lorenzo de’ <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> (1449–1492), and it was with sculpture that he made his name in Rome in the last years of the fifteenth century. He used strong outlines to emphasise the Virgin’s shape and scraped away the surrounding paint, much like in sculpture, creating a strongly three-dimensional effect. The way the figures fill almost the entire panel, leaving no room for a landscape setting, is also similar to relief sculpture. Not coincidentally, Michelangelo based the angels on a sculpture: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0U1I-0001-0000-0000.htm">Luca della Robbia</a>’s organ loft of the 1430s (Cathedral Museum, Florence).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span> has been linked to a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> Michelangelo acquired in Rome in 1497. We do not know what this panel was used for and the figures in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span> are less fluid than in Michelangelo’s sculpture of the same date. Although the posture of the angel on the far right is similar to that of the marble <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus</span> that he completed in 1497 (Bargello, Florence), the sculpture is markedly more animated and assured.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Importantly too, the close technical similarity between the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span> and the work of Ghirlandaio and his studio, strongly suggests that Michelangelo painted it in Florence during his initial years as an independent artist in the early 1490s. There is also a clear connection to his contemporary friend and colleague <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q31-0001-0000-0000.htm">Granacci</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rest on the Flight into Egypt with the Infant Saint John</span> (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). As in Michelangelo’s painting, Granacci places the Virgin on a rocky seat with the Christ Child in her lap and the young Baptist reaching up towards him. Granacci’s Christ Child appears to be an adaptation in reverse of Michelangelo’s Baptist, or vice-versa. Unfortunately we do not know the exact date of Granacci’s panel either – it is usually dated to 1494, but has been dated as much as a decade later.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small panel is painted in fine detail, resembling a precious painted miniature or illuminated manuscript. It formed the left side of a diptych (a work of two parts) joined with a central hinge; the other side showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Dead Christ</span>. Joseph, the Virgin Mary and a shepherd in torn clothes pray before the infant Christ. He lies naked in a manger in front of an elaborate wooden structure that looks more like a temple or church than a stable. Although it is made of humble materials, its design reflects the ideas of the eminent local architect, Alberti, whose church architecture incorporated features of ancient Roman architecture. This cultural reference would not have been lost upon the diptych’s owner Eleonora of Aragon, Duchess of Ferrara. Eleonora focused her prayer upon the body of Christ and its place in the Mass, when Catholics believed that the bread and wine of the Eucharist became Christ’s body and blood. The focus here upon Christ’s naked body was appropriate for her private prayer.</p></div>

The right-hand panel shows the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGB-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Dead Christ</a></span>. It was made for the Duchess of ferrara, Eleonora of Aragon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> kneel to worship the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>, who lies naked in a manger. Next to Mary, a shepherd in ragged, torn clothes follows suit bending his knee in prayer. In the landscape beyond we see what called him to the stable: three small, shadow-like figures look up at an angelic figure surrounded by light. This is the annunciation to the shepherds (Luke 2: 8-20) when the angel of the Lord appeared and told them to visit Christ who had just been born at Bethlehem. The stable looks like a temple or church, but its materials are humble: a structure of wooden beams is filled in with flexible young branches, woven together to create a lattice for the walls and for the manger which is being used as a crib. An ass leans his neck out to grasp for straw from the manger where the infant Christ lies; an ox with a golden coat turns his back on the Child, his imposing hindquarters dominating the middle of the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ercole</a> has chosen to show the annunciation and adoration of the shepherds rather than that of the wise men which occurs in the Gospel of Matthew. He has taken care to paint the figures in simple clothes: Mary’s halo is modest, a faint series of sketchy gilded semi-circles, and the shepherd’s hose is torn at the knees and sags around his ankle. The grandeur of the stable’s architecture, with its classical style triangular pediments and supporting columns fixed in stone bases, is based on the ideas of the fifteenth-century architect <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0RBJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alberti</a>. Alberti’s designs for churches, derived from ancient temples, were current at the time in the nearby city of Mantua. The contrast of cheap and rustic materials and grand architectural design is a reminder of the significance of the Christ Child’s birth in this rural setting and poor family. The message reflects Christ’s teachings on the importance and spiritual power of humility. The shepherd’s ragged clothing and the basket-weave style walls also feature in an Adoration scene by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> painted for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Este family</a> several decades earlier (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York); it seems that the grand dukes and duchesses enjoyed such quaint details. The unpretentious simplicity of the painted scene would have contrasted with the exterior of the diptych, which was covered with velvet and gilded silver ornament fitting for a ducal family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s body is not swaddled or covered but displayed stretched out and naked. This emphasis on his flesh reflects the Duchess’s particular devotion to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Corpus Christi</span> (‘the body of Christ’) and refers to the institution of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>, the rite at which Christians remember and give thanks for the death and resurrection of Christ by eating bread and drinking wine; Catholics believe these miraculously transform into his body and blood. Christ’s naked body in this scene which celebrates his birth is mirrored in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGB-0001-0000-0000.htm">diptych’s other panel</a>, which focuses upon his body after his death. The point is reinforced by the angle of the crib, which matches that of the tomb. When the diptych was folded together, they would have met in the middle.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This little picture formed the right side of a diptych (a work of two parts). It was joined with central hinges to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Adoration of the Shepherds</span>. Ercole made this for the Duchess of Ferrara, Eleonora of Aragon, when he was court painter at Ferrara. Eleonora’s personal prayer centred on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Corpus Christi</span> (Latin for ‘body of Christ’), so this imagery is appropriate. Christ is shown nearly naked, just after his death. Two angels prop up his limp corpse and we can see marks from the nails of the Crucifixion on his hands. A faintly sketched image of Calvary, the site of the Crucifixion, appears on the hill; Christ’s slumped body is being removed from the central cross. Saint Jerome – identifiable by his symbol, the lion – kneels next to Christ’s tomb. He holds a rock, ready to strike his chest. This was an act of penitence which in this context was probably supposed to encourage humility and self denial.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the left-hand panel of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0JX1-0001-0000-0000.htm">a diptych</a>, a painting made up of two panels, joined with a hinge so that it could be opened and closed like a book. The right hand panel shows <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Shepherds</a></span>. It was made for the Duchess of Ferrara, Eleonora of Aragon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ is shown after his death, propped up on the edge of his marble tomb by two angels. He is naked apart from a loin cloth and a crown of thorns on his head. The wounds from the nails of the Crucifixion are visible on his lifeless hands. The yellow-white skin of his corpse contrasts with the tanned skin of the kneeling Saint Jerome, whose athletic body is covered only partially by a red cloak. As he contemplates Christ’s body, Jerome clutches a stone in his right hand, ready to beat his chest, inspired here by Christ’s suffering. He is accompanied by a small lion, the animal whom, according to legend, he tamed when living in the wilderness. His pose, with right hand raised up, may be based upon Ercole’s fellow Ferrarese artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cosimo Tura</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Jerome</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the top left, painted in faint, minute brushstrokes is Calvary, the site where Jesus was crucified; his drooping dead body is being removed from the central cross for burial in his tomb. As in the painting’s pair, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Shepherds</a></span>, the miniature scene in the landscape shows the event that preceded the main image. Saint Francis kneels on the middle plateau, raising the palms of his hands towards the heavens. Saint Francis is said to have meditated upon the Crucifixion with such piety that he too was afflicted with the wounds of the Cross, known as the stigmata. Golden rays painted with gold leaf emanate from the hands and feet of the crucified Christ, directly striking the saint’s palms and transferring the wounds of the Cross to him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The emphasis on Christ’s dead body mirrors the left-hand panel, where the naked body of the infant Christ is the focus of adoration. Images of Christ standing or seated in his open tomb were very popular in Italy in the late Middle Ages and early Renaissance, and were known as the ‘Imago Pietatis’ (‘image of pity’) or the Man of Sorrows. They were based upon an image from Byzantium, the Eastern Christian empire. Ercole’s version, where Christ is supported by two angels, is similar to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GH6-0001-0000-0000.htm">those by Giovanni Bellini</a> working in nearby Venice. Meditation upon Christ’s suffering and death were supposed to help worshippers develop an emotional and personal connection with him.  Usually, images of the dead Christ did not include landscape backgrounds, but here the hillside is a continuation from the left-hand diptych panel, and the presence of Saint Jerome and Saint Francis offer examples of saints whose prayer focused upon Christ’s suffering.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The original owner of the diptych was the Duchess of Ferrara, Eleonora of Aragon, whom we know directed her prayer in particular towards the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Corpus Christi</span> (‘the body of Christ’) celebrated in the Christian tradition at Mass through the Eucharist. When Eleonora held this diptych in her hand and contemplated Christ’s birth and death, his body as a child and as an adult, her thumb may have pressed upon the inscription of his name carved into the triangular pediment of the lid of his elegant marble tomb.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We do not know the identity of this elegant young lady. Her clothes are not especially extravagant and she was perhaps a gentlewoman rather than an aristocrat. In line with fifteenth-century fashion, her hair is shaved from the front of her head to make her forehead look higher, and her veil is brought down below her eyebrows. The artist has raised her ears to make her neck look longer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her brown gown seems to be made of wool, with contrasting collar and cuffs of a dark blue material, possibly damask, and a purple silk belt. The V of her neckline is filled by a red <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pièce</span>, held in place by blackish laces. A low, truncated cone of yellow, patterned with white and edged with a golden band, sits on her head. An M-shaped headdress is pinned over this, made of a veil which has been folded so as to come down over her forehead and ears, where it seems to be held in place by a metal fitting of some kind. The pins in her hat and in the scarves at her neck are yellow, perhaps gold.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is a good example of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>’s style of portraiture. A similar, slightly smaller portrait in Washington (National Gallery of Art) is securely attributed to the artist and is of markedly higher quality, both in drawing and execution. Our painting should be attributed to an assistant or follower, who had learned much from his mentor and who may have been trying to emulate the Washington portrait or something like it. Some idiosyncrasies of this portrait – the exaggerated tear ducts, the emphasis on the lower linings of the eyes and the shape of the mouth – are also found in an image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Lamentation</a> (now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague) which was also probably painted in van der Weyden’s workshop. Perhaps the same painter worked on both pictures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The discreet shadows cast on the background by the sitter and frame create a sense of three-dimensional space. They are not found in surviving portraits attributed to van der Weyden, but are seen in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CMR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marco Barbarigo</a></span> by Jan van Eyck and in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mater Dolorosa</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ Crowned with Thorns</a></span> by the workshop of Dirk Bouts. They are early instances of what was to become a popular convention in sixteenth-century painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the back of the panel is a very damaged painting of  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> crowned with thorns. It is unusual, although not unique, to find a religious image on the back of a portrait. Although it resembles in some ways the heads of Christ in van der Weyden’s other paintings, it is not possible to say whether it was painted at the same time or in the same workshop.</p></div>

Christ is shown after his death, his emaciated body propped up against the back edge of the tomb, his hand lying limp upon the marble. This type of image was sometimes known as the ‘Imago Pietatis’ (‘image of pity’), or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8B-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pietà</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Standing behind a parapet are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, who cradles Christ’s head, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>. Saint Jerome wears the cowl (hooded cloak) of a hermit over blue robes, a reminder to contemporary viewers of the saint’s time in the desert, where, in contemplation of Christ’s suffering at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, he practised self-flagellation, beating his chest with a rock in empathy with Christ. Saint John the Baptist also spent time in the wilderness, preaching about Christ. According to the Gospel of John, he ate only locusts and honey, and wore a rough camel-skin tunic. In this painting, tufts of hair peek out of the inner face of his tunic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The choice of saints is fitting for this kind of image, which was intended to promote empathy with the suffering of Christ, but it is unusual: it was more common for Christ to be shown propped up by angels, as in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini’s</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GH6-0001-0000-0000.htm">picture in our collection</a> and in another Pietà by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZ2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Zoppo</a> in the Musei Civici, Pesaro. There are no earlier examples with saints in the Veneto region of Italy, where these kinds of images were particularly popular. The saints‘ direct communication with Christ here transforms the image into a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FXQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">sacra conversazione</a></span> (’holy conversation'), an innovative format in the late fifteenth century. The direct interaction between Jerome and Christ is comparable to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ercole’s panel</a> from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> made for Eleonora of Aragona, the Duchess of Ferrara.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of the dead Christ often formed the uppermost part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm"> polyptych</a>, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F7D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgio Schiavone’s panel</a> in our collection. This one, however, has a pattern on the reverse which imitates the precious red and white stone called porphyry, used for decoration in ancient Rome. This suggests that the panel was intended to be held and moved around, rather than viewed only from the front. It was probably made for private prayer.  We do not know who commissioned the picture but it was probably made in Venice, where Zoppo would have seen examples of the type by Bellini.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The soft folds of the fabrics in pastel colours, which appear luminous as they reflect the light, are characteristic of Zoppo’s unique style and reflect his skill as a draughtsman who could create clear and crisp designs full of graceful, flowing curves.</p></div>
