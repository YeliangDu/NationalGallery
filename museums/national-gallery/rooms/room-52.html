The burnished gold background tells us that he is now in a heavenly rather than an earthly realm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dirk Bouts</a> has painted every agonising detail: the blue shadows of the thorns thrust deep into his forehead, and those around the holes in his hands; his translucent tears mingled with the blood dripping down his face. This graphic image might seem shocking now, but in the late fifteenth century images of the weeping and suffering Christ were very popular, and were produced in large numbers in the workshop of Bouts and his followers. The quality of this painting and the skill with which the artist has worked wet into wet paint to achieve the details of the jewels, the embroidery and the crown suggest it is by Bouts himself. Its painting technique is similar to that of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man (Jan van Winckele?)</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Small devotional paintings like this were used to aid private prayer. The painting was clearly intended to be seen close up, and the level of detail draws us deeper and deeper in. We can see every hair in Christ’s beard and eyebrows, and the tears in his red-rimmed eyes. The gold background is flecked with painted dots and hatched lines, making a halo of gold, red, green and blue rings around Christ’s head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting’s focus on Christ’s body was intended to remind Christian viewers that God became man and died on the Cross for humanity’s sake. Popular religious movements of the late fifteenth century held that meditation on the pain of the Passion offered a route to salvation. In the Netherlands <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Devotio Moderna</span> (‘Modern Devotion’, a religious movement which focused on personal spirituality rather than church ritual) encouraged meditation on the pain inflicted by the crown of thorns. Thomas à Kempis, an important early member of the movement, wrote a prayer to the head of Christ describing the ‘most grievous sufferings which, in the thorny coronation of your sacred head, you endured for us’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Joseph Henry Green, an eminent surgeon and friend of poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge, owned the painting in the nineteenth century. It was left to the National Gallery by Green’s wife.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A fair-haired man stands in an interior, gazing past us into the distance. Behind him is an open window; though it we can see a landscape with a church in the distance. There is a  date – 1462 – on the wall behind him; curiously, the first three numbers appear to be carved into the plaster, while the fourth stands proud of it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s dress is sober but distinctive. Its single colour is unusual for the period, but it is not the dress of a poor man. His dull red robe and hat appear to be wool and his sleeves, which are slit and the buttoned across his upper arm, are lined and trimmed with brown fur. Underneath this he wears a doublet in the same colour with a standing collar, possibly of velvet. His white shirt is just visible at his throat. His hands seem to rest on the frame, an illusion possibly reinforced by the original frame, which is now missing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the earliest datable, and only dated, portrait attributed to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dirk Bouts</a>. Although Bouts knew all about vanishing points, the perspective of the window is distorted, perhaps for aesthetic reasons. The alternation of light and shadow across the portrait is marvellously contrived so that the lit side of the sitter’s face is silhouetted against the shadowed glass of the shutter, while the shadowed side of his hat and face is silhouetted against the lit wall behind. The idea of making the sitter’s hands appear to rest on the frame had been developed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P03-0001-0000-0000.htm">Robert Campin</a> (compare this to <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXH-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman</a></span>) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> (as in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CUZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Lady</a></span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are not sure who the sitter is but he might be Jan van Winckele, a prominent citizen of Louvain, where Bouts was living in the 1460s, and a friend of the artist. He was a lawyer, and graduated from the University of Louvain in 1449. He owned at least two of Bouts’s paintings and was a witness to his will. In 1462 van Winckele was given an important post in the university administration, and the portrait was possibly made to commemorate this event. The plainness of his dress was perhaps a response to Louvain university regulations, which complained of ‘indecent’ dress and laid down that university members should dress soberly in a single colour. In 1467 George Lichton, a Scottish student at Louvain, made sketches of his classes in a volume of his lecture notes. These show both students and teachers in red robes and hats with distinctive stalks on the top.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his will, van Winckele laid down that if his children died without heirs all his property should go towards the foundation of a college for lawyers. His son, also Jan, died childless and in 1555 Collegium Winckelianum was set up on the site of their family home. It is possible that this portrait went to the College, which closed in 1797. By the 1830s the portrait was in a private collection in London.</p></div>

Made in large numbers in the Netherlands in the fifteenth century, few exist today. They are notoriously delicate and this one is in remarkably good condition. Muted tones and a chalky appearance were characteristic of these cloth paintings, but time has also shaped the image we see today. A film of dirt, which covers the entire surface, cannot be removed, and thinly-applied layers of paint have worn away in some places, revealing now-discoloured linen. Colours have changed and faded: the Virgin’s cloak is now brownish, and Joseph of Arimathea’s tabard, once pale blue, appears green.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But a hint of the original colour can be seen along the top edge, where a strip of brighter blue sky has been protected by an old frame. The rust-stained holes show where the linen was tacked to a frame, perhaps soon after the painting was made. Along the bottom edge we can see the remains of a painted border. Coloured borders are often found on paintings on linen. It seems that linen cloths were stretched on temporary supports to be painted. Once finished they were cut along the outer edges of these borders. Some were then mounted on coarser fabric and hung like tapestries. Others were attached to panels, and a frame was then laid on top of the painted border. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Entombment</span> must have been given a frame rather smaller than intended.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Netherlandish painting was in great demand across Europe at this time, and those on cloth were especially popular as they could be rolled up for transportation and then mounted once they reached their destination. Bouts probably made this painting for export to Italy, possibly Venice, where it remained until the nineteenth century. It was possibly, although not certainly, part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>, other parts of which survive in other collections.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bouts’s pictures are extremely difficult to date. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Entombment</span>, the perspective is mismanaged; in his datable pictures of the 1460s and early 1470s Bouts shows a remarkable command of perspective. The picture is also strongly influenced by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der  Weyden</a>’s paintings of the 1430s and early 1440s. It was probably painted in the 1450s.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin and Christ Child are seen as if at an open window. Mary gazes lovingly at her son and offers him her breast. Images of the Virgin breastfeeding emphasised Christ’s humanity and vulnerability, while showing her at a window recalls how medieval princes presented themselves to their subjects. A sumptuous gold cloth hangs behind the pair. It is a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a>, often displayed behind medieval royalty, reminding viewers that the Virgin was Queen of Heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Small religious panels like this were used as an aid to private prayer in people’s homes.

Christ is perched on the window sill and the opulent cushion under him appears to jut out over the edge of the sill, a deep shadow falling beneath it. The white cloth around him may have continued over the original frame, which is now missing, strengthening the illusion. Bouts also played with spatial effects in a way characteristic of Netherlandish painting at this period: we look into the room through one window and then out again through a second, to see a landscape and the blue spires of a medieval city, providing another link to the contemporary world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The warm, glowing colours are characteristic of the technique of applying layers of transparent oil glazes over opaque underpainting. Like many early Netherlandish painters, Bouts used cheaper pigments for the underlayers. Here, for example, the Virgin’s robe is painted with azurite beneath the more expensive ultramarine.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This striking portrait of a man in a red hat forms a pair with Campin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXH-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman</a></span> – the sitters were clearly husband and wife. We have no clues to their identity, but their clothes suggest they were relatively prosperous townspeople. The man’s red headdress, or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chaperon</span>, consists of several parts: a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">bourrelet</span> (a padded ring), part of which is visible above his forehead; a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cornette</span> (the long, scarf-like tail) which has been wound round the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">bourrelet</span>; and a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">patte</span> (the shoulder cape), which hangs over his left shoulder, its seam clearly shown.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The face is so lifelike, the level of detail so astonishing and the tiny tonal transitions in skin and fabric so carefully observed that we are almost unaware of how <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P03-0001-0000-0000.htm">Campin</a> has ordered the man’s clothes and features to convey his character. His forehead creases in a frown which narrows his eyes, and the corners of his mouth and eyes curve resolutely downwards. Minute variations in colour suggest reddened skin and wrinkles. His skin sags beneath his jaw and forms crow’s feet around his eyes, which have only the smallest of catchlights. He slouches and his head is off centre; he does not dominate the composition as his wife does.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although both figures are silhouetted against flat black backgrounds, they are lit in different ways. Campin must have intended to show different schemes of lighting and rearranged his studio accordingly at all their sittings. The shadows cast on the man’s face stress the falling lines of the pattern Campin created; his hands are not included, perhaps because they would have been at odds with this pattern. His clothes echo the drooping lines of his face, and he seems world-weary, uncertain and disillusioned. His hat has been brought forward so it seems to press down on his head, and its scarves to flatten his bulk – unlike the hat in Jan van Eyck’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D41-0001-0000-0000.htm">assertive self portrait</a>, which flies confidently upwards.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has shown that Campin didn't always follow exactly the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> when painting, but subtly  adjusted the compositions to make them more formal and abstract. The contours of the man’s face below his left cheekbone and opposite his mouth are drawn to the left of the painted contours. The seam between his collar and his robe was underdrawn as a fairly broad dark line and there are other lines in the collars which may be underdrawing. Areas of hatching, in short, parallel, evenly spaced strokes indicated areas of light and shade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist’s interest in facial expression and emotion and the use of pattern to increase emotional effect are comparable with other works thought to be by Campin, and these portraits are therefore attributed to him. The clothes are in the fashion of about 1430 and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN3-0008-0000-0000.htm">dendrochronological</a> evidence suggests a date around or after 1435.</p></div>

We are shown what the couple looked like, but Campin has conveyed their personalities and relationship too. The woman looks younger than her husband, and more forceful and optimistic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her rich, purple <span class="dokuwiki_italic">houpelande</span> is pulled into narrow folds by a tight, wide belt and its sleeves are trimmed in grey fur. She wears a gold ring with a cabochon (uncut) stone, and an elaborate headdress, made of three pieces of white fabric which Campin has manipulated into geometrical folds. Around her neck is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">barbet</span>, a cloth worn by married women that covered the chin and neck. On her head is a enveloping <span class="dokuwiki_italic">howve</span>, which forms two peaks over the modest horns made by her hairstyle. The edges of the cloth have been fluted or goffered – that is, crimped with heated irons, and the layers secured with pins. She, like her husband, is well dressed – but their clothes are not excessively rich. This suggests that they were prosperous townsfolk, perhaps from Tournai where Campin lived and worked, although we don't know their identities.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Campin has used subtle geometric patterns to reinforce his characterisation of each sitter, and lit them in different ways. The woman’s near eye is in the centre of her panel so that she dominates the composition in a way her husband does not. Her eyes are bright and wide open, with gleaming catchlights, her irises are clear of her lower lids and her eyebrows are well above her upper lids. Her skin is smooth, the tip of her nose turns up and her eyes curve up at the corners, a movement echoed and amplified by the crisp folds of her headdress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectograms</a> and X-rays reveal how Campin adjusted the headdress to echo the rising lines of the woman’s face. In the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> the veils sat lower across her forehead, but Campin painted them in a more upward curve. The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">barbet</span> tucked under her chin lifts her whole face so that her chin seems to form the bottom of an inverted triangle. Even her neatly folded hands reinforce the impression of buoyancy created by the other patterns.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Campin exploited the technical possibilities of slow-drying <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> to the full in this painting. The fluted edges of her veils were achieved by painting strokes of thick white, possibly done <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a>, into the veils, which are very pale grey. In order to stress certain contours in the veils, he scored lines into the paint then painted a dark line along the incision to give it greater emphasis. Other incised lines were used to create reflected lights, for instance on the fold of the veil across the woman’s left breast. Her fur cuffs were painted grey, with black lines painted wet-in-wet and then dragged or feathered to give the illusion of texture.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This puzzling picture of the Virgin and Child is often called the ‘Firescreen Madonna’, after the large wicker firescreen behind the Virgin’s head. It is a complex painting in many ways. We do not know who it was made for, or where or how it was used.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are not even sure how it originally looked: the painting was extensively restored in the nineteenth century. A narrow strip was added along the top, confusing the structure of the chimney piece. The panel was cut on the right, perhaps because it had been damaged by fire and a broader strip – including the Virgin’s left elbow, the carved cupboard and the chalice – was added. We don‘t know whether these details were copied from the original or invented by the restorer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although they are biblical figures, the artist has placed the Virgin and Christ inside a wealthy, even palatial, Netherlandish home. A fire is blazing in the large stone fireplace, its flames just visible over the top of the firescreen. Firelight flickers on the tall iron firedogs, and on the three-legged wooden stool in front of the window. The floor is laid with coloured tiles; cushions and costly textiles are flung on the carved wooden bench. A beautifully bound bible, with blue and red initials, lies open beside Mary, its parchment pages fluttering in the draft from the open window. Its jewelled clasps, gilt fore-edges, red tasselled page-markers and white <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chemise</span> – a cover, like a dust-jacket, which protected especially precious manuscripts – are minutely depicted, down to the tie holding the chemise around the book.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin is clearly the Queen of Heaven in her palace. She wears a blue overdress (which was once more purple) over a linen shift, open at the neck to show her blue-veined breasts. The overdress is lined with grey fur and trimmed with precious stones, her long loose hair is a symbol of both virginity and regality. Wisely, she has spread a white cloth over her knees to protect her clothes from the naked, wriggling child. A tiny hook at its corner would have allowed it to be hung up to dry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Through the window we can see a walled Netherlandish town with a tall church tower and gabled buildings. Its tiny details are tricky to see, but horsemen ride through the streets, a woman stands in a doorway watching two men with a ladder fighting a fire next door, and a customer chats to a woman at a shop window. In the distance, a white farmhouse nestles in wooded hills, and mountains fade into the blue distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are various oddities in the composition: the Virgin seems to hover between bench and floor, and although she holds her right breast she would feed Christ more easily with her left. Her left hand doesn’t properly support her child, who waves one hand aimlessly in the air: he has lost the beads which would have given his gesture meaning. The artist, who perhaps also painted the Merode Triptych (The Met Cloisters, New York), seems to have assembled elements from different paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P03-0001-0000-0000.htm">Campin</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis reveals many changes. Christ originally looked towards the window, not the viewer, and the position of his feet was altered. There were also alterations in the Virgin’s face, sleeves and left hand, which appears to have been moved downwards to reveal Christ’s genitals (these were hidden by a restorer but came to light when the painting was cleaned in 1992–3). It was clearly important that his genitals could be seen – they were perhaps meant to remind viewers that Christ was fully human, and shared humanity’s vulnerability.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This tiny painting – almost postcard sized – shows an endearing fireside scene: Christ’s bath time. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits on a cushion on the floor, surrounded by domestic paraphernalia, clasping her son tightly in both hands and pressing her face to his.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although they are biblical figures, the artist has placed Mary and Christ in a fifteenth-century Netherlandish home. Behind Mary is a wooden bench covered with the same cloth of gold as her cushion. This is a wealthy, even palatial, household: the walls are partly panelled, the windows partly glazed and shuttered; there is a large stone fireplace with tongs and fire dog; the bench and the Virgin’s cushion are of matching cloth of gold. The artist has shown off his skill by including a variety of light sources and consequent shadows. Though it is sunny outside, light streams through the half-open shutters, casting double shadows on the walls. A fire burns brightly in the grate and a candle has been lit in a sconce above the fireplace. Small puffs of smoke and floating embers rise from the smouldering logs and the flickering flames light the sides of the hearth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A brass bowl in front of the fire and a basket of white cloths – presumably nappies or swaddling bands – sit on the floor. Mary wears a rich blue dress which falls into intricate, angular folds. Her sleeves are trimmed with grey fur, and her red sandal peeps out from under its edge. Her long uncovered hair was a symbol both of her virginity and of her royal status. Golden rays around the Virgin and Child’s heads remind us that this is no ordinary mother, but the Mother of God. The naked Christ Child twists on her lap, to kiss his mother’s lips and stroke her chin with his left hand. The Virgin and Child embracing was a common motif in Italian and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> art, as in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GBA-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Two Angels</a></span>, but here he also touches his genitals – though someone has damaged the painting so it’s hard to see exactly what he is doing. In fifteenth-century Netherlandish painting the Child often displays his genitals, but here his gesture is unusual. It perhaps refers to his Circumcision, or more probably to the idea that the Virgin, as a symbol of the Church, was understood in the Middle Ages as the bride of Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is thought to have been derived from a lost painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P03-0001-0000-0000.htm">Campin</a>. Certain stylistic features are similar to works by Jaques Daret, one of Campin’s apprentices, who became a master of the Tournai painters' guild in 1432.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The framed panel was made by gouging out of the surface of the plank, leaving a raised lip for the frame. The wood, its vertical grain now clearly visible, is Baltic oak, cut from the same tree as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Franciscan (?)</span>, also by Campin’s workshop – the two panels were clearly made by the same carpenter. They do not seem to have been designed to be seen together, however: there are no marks of hinges on the sides and they seem to be by different artists, although probably active in the same workshop. The back was originally marbled in red, black and white and the frame was possibly marbled too. In the Middle Ages paintings were not always hung on walls, and a small panel like this could kept in a box or a bag, and carried from place to place to use for private devotion.</p></div>

We do not know who the sitter is, and although he is wearing the grey habit of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> his hair is not tonsured – shaved on top as a sign of humility – as was customary for friars. He holds a scroll on which no trace of writing is visible. The precise identity of the artist is also uncertain, although he seems to have been a member of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P03-0001-0000-0000.htm">Robert Campin</a>’s workshop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter’s face is strongly lit, and stands out powerfully against the dark blue background. His blue eyes gaze into the distance, and his features are slightly misaligned: his eyes don't look in the same direction, and his mouth is asymmetrical. The style of the face resembles that of the female donor in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Merode Triptych</span> (The Met Cloisters, New York), as does the profile thumb. There’s a lack of interest in linear pattern, which is characteristic of the pictures associated with Campin himself, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F74-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Man</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXH-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman</a></span>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has shown that the artist made various changes during the course of painting the picture. The sitter once held a book, his index finger apparently tucked into its pages – this was later changed to a scroll.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The gilding is not original, and technical analysis suggests that the frame and possibly the reverse were possibly originally decorated with pinkish marbling. The frame and support are carved out of one piece of wood, Baltic oak, from the same tree as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CWV-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child in an Interior</a></span>. Although both paintings are Campinesque in style, they do not appear to be by the same painter, and there are no traces of any hinges to indicate they were part of the same complex. The framed supports must have been made at the same time by the same panel-maker; presumably they were supplied to the same painter’s workshop but then, within that workshop, assigned to two different artists.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Virgin in an Interior</span> was painted by Jacques Daret when he was working as Campin’s assistant, and if this painting is by one of his colleagues in Campin’s workshop, possibly the painter of the Merode donors, then both pictures could be dated before 1432, when Daret left the workshop. If this dating is correct, this is one of the earliest surviving portraits where the sitter rests his fingers on the frame, which would become a conventional pose in Netherlandish painting.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young man stands in the corner of a vaulted room. He wears a bright red <span class="dokuwiki_italic">houpelande</span>, a long-sleeved over-garment worn in the later Middle Ages. It is belted at the waist and trimmed with brown fur at neck and cuffs. It seems to be made of wool, perhaps the famous – and expensive – Flemish ’scarlet‘ cloth. A black <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chaperon</span>, a fifteenth-century male headdress, hangs down his back; its <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cornette</span>, a scarf-like attachment, comes down over his shoulder. His hair has been shaved at both temples and the back of his neck, as was fashionable for a smart young man in the 1450s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He wears a gold signet ring, and holds a small but luxurious book with gilded fore-edges and a tasselled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chemise</span> binding, probably a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Book of Hours</a> or prayer book. At his waist is a small bag with metal fittings, attached to his belt. This kind of girdle purse was a fashionable, expensive item. If you look inside it, you can see what seems to be a small book closed by a silver clasp. This is a ’notebook' of wax tablets with a metal stylus tucked into the clasp.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is more than a simple portrait, however: the room itself is intriguing. Through the window we can see a landscape with trees, roofs and a castle in the distance. A small white mark is, on closer inspection, the back of a horse. The other window is decorated with statues in niches, one of which is missing. The surviving figures seem to be a bearded and barefoot John the Baptist on the right, a sibyl or prophetess in a long gown and a turban at the bottom, and a prophet. The latter two hold scrolls, symbols of pre-Christian authors in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> art. Through the window we can see a balcony made of inlaid stone, topped with a lion resting his foot on a shield.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is not clear precisely what these figures mean, or what kind of a space the man is standing in. Is it a house, a castle or a church? And what is the young man doing – is he meant to be a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIM-0008-0000-0000.htm">donor</a>? Donors usually knelt in Netherlandish art, as in Rogier van der Weyden’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CZN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pietà</a></span>, but this man seems to be standing. He does not pray, but holds a devotional book, as in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Young Man</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The text nailed to the wall might shed some light on the mystery. A piece of parchment has been pinned to an arched board; we can see the light reflecting off the pins, the shadows around them and a loose corner curling up. On it is a prayer in Latin and a picture of a miraculous image of Christ known as the Holy Face. Prayers to the Holy Face were popular in the mid-fifteenth century: people believed that reciting these allowed them to reduce the time they spent in purgatory after death. The young man himself is perhaps an Italian merchant. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christus</a> often worked for Italian patrons and the painting was in an Italian collection in the eighteenth or early nineteenth century. The tablets in the man’s bag show that he often had to make notes, as a merchant would.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel was possibly the left wing of a folding <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a>. There are now no sign of hinges but these would have been attached to the original frame, which has been lost. It would have covered the strip around the edge which is now partly gilded (the gold is a later addition). Perhaps the man is reciting the prayer in his book and was originally looking across at another image, now lost.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small portrait is puzzling in many ways. We don‘t know who this man was or why he is holding a scroll, which is – rather strangely – inscribed on the outside. The painting’s tall, narrow shape is unusual and there are mysterious inscriptions on the large, cracked stone parapet which runs along the front.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the bottom is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Eyck</a>’s signature in abbreviated Latin: Actu[m] an[n]o d[omi]ni 1432 10 die octobris a ioh[anne] de Eyck (’done on 10 October 1432 by Jan van Eyck‘). Van Eyck often dated his paintings to a single day, although they would have taken much longer to complete; perhaps this was they day on which it was finished. Above this are large capitals, apparently carved into the stone, reading ’LEAL SOVVENIR‘ (’Loyal Remembrance‘), the words divided by a deep crack in the stone. This is the only French inscription on a surviving picture by van Eyck. It might mean that the picture is a good likeness, or that it was meant to be a keepsake. It is possible that it was painted after the sitter’s death, in which case the crumbling parapet might be an allusion to man’s mortality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the top of the parapet, carefully centred, is a small white inscription in Greek letters. There are two words, written in Greek, the last letter disappearing into a chip in the stone. Van Eyck often used the Greek alphabet to spell out words in Latin or Dutch. Here it is Latin: TUM OTHEOS (’then God‘). What this means is unclear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Even the phrasing of van Eyck’s signature is unusual, and is reminiscent of the wording of a legal document. The scroll in the sitter’s hand looks like a legal deed, although it is rolled inside out so the writing is on the outside. Could he have been a lawyer? He is dressed as a prosperous member of the middle class, in a dark green <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chaperon</span>, fashionable fifteenth-century male headgear which van Eyck showed in several portraits (for example <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D41-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)</a></span>). Its short hood falls over his left shoulder, and the long scarf-like <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cornette</span> hangs down by his right. His red <span class="dokuwiki_italic">houpelande</span> – a long-sleeved robe worn by both men and women – is trimmed with brown fur and fastened at the neck with two small buttons.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Eyck often put his sitters’ names on the frames of their portraits, but this has been lost and the panel has been trimmed down almost to the edge of the paint. The back was marbled but this is now very damaged. Paintings were not always hung on walls in the fifteenth century, as is usual now, and the backs were sometimes decorated too as they could be seen.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This impassive face is almost certainly that of Jan van Eyck himself, and the painting a powerful statement of his artistic skill. His motto, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Als Ich Can</span>, is painted in Greek letters on the upper frame; the words are an abbreviation of a Flemish saying and a pun on Jan’s name: ‘as I[ich/Eyk] can [but not as I would]’. The bottom inscription is in abbreviated Latin and says, ‘Jan van Eyck made me on 21 October 1433’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter’s clothing is that of a prosperous individual. Most striking is his flamboyant red hat – a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chaperon</span>, a headdress for men fashionable in the fifteenth century. The hood, which usually hung down over the wearer’s neck and shoulders, has been piled up on top of the sitter’s head, the long tail wound around it. The strong contrast between the dark shadows in the creases and the bright highlights where the folded fabric catches the light is typical of van Eyck.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This man, his face impassive and his gaze intense, is almost certainly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> himself. No other portraits of him survive to confirm his appearance, but the painting looks like a self portrait: the sitter is craning forward slightly as if looking in a mirror, and the piercing blue eyes gaze in slightly different directions, as if the artist were concentrating on each in turn.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is no name on the frame, as was usual for Van Eyck’s portraits, but the artist’s motto, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Als Ich Can</span>, appears in large Greek letters on the upper frame. The phrase is an abbreviation of a Flemish saying and also a pun on Jan’s name: ‘as I [ich/Eyck] can - but not as I would’. He included it on several paintings, including his portrait of his wife, Margaret (Groeningemuseum, Bruges), although here it is especially prominent.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The words might seem humble, but they subtly draw attention to his extraordinary skill as a painter. Here, limited colours and the intense contrast between the brightly lit face and the dark background make for an arresting image. It seems as if the sitter is turning away from a strong light and towards us. The light casts shadows on his face, making the wrinkles around his left eye, the veins in his left temple and the lines around his mouth stand out. Although it looks astonishingly natural, van Eyck has played with the proportions of both face and body to achieve such a dramatic impact. The sitter’s shoulders are narrow and sloping, and the head enlarged so that it dominates the composition. Technical analysis shows that there is relatively little <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, and what is there suggests that van Eyck adapted the picture during painting. He emphasised certain features, making the nose larger and turning it slightly more into profile than the rest of the face. This was a trick, typical of the artist, to make the face more recognisable.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although famous for minutely realistic depictions of surface effects, van Eyck painted his pictures with great speed and economy. We can see this in the man’s stubble. If you look closely you can see that it is made up of tiny individual dabs of paint. The darker brown dots were painted before the lighter ones, which are mostly white. On the chin he has mixed a little blue with the white so that the dots seem to catch the light. Van Eyck’s skill is such that the effect of this hasty painting is more convincing than the carefully painted facial hair of Memling’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0JS7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint John</a> or the grey five-o‘clock shadow of David’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F67-0001-0000-0000.htm">Augustinian friar</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This sitter’s clothing – that of a prosperous individual, but not a member of the upper nobility – would have been appropriate for van Eyck. His family were members of the gentry, and he himself was paid a handsome salary as court painter to Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. The man wears a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">houpelande</span>, a loose overgown with long sleeves, belted at the waist, worn by both men and women in the later Middle Ages. The high collar is open at the neck and trimmed with brown fur; underneath we can just see the neck of his white shirt. Most striking is his flamboyant red hat – a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chaperon</span>, a headdress for men fashionable in the fifteenth century. The hood, which usually hung down over the wearer’s neck and shoulders, has been piled up on top of the sitter’s head here; we can see the parallel lines of its lower edge rising in a crinkled heap almost to the top of the painting. The long tail has been wrapped around the outside and tucked in above the left eye, perhaps to keep it out of the way while he was painting. The end of the tail flies upwards in an extravagant flourish above the sitter’s right temple. The strong contrast between the dark shadows in the creases and the bright highlights where the folded fabric catches the light is typical of van Eyck.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of the colours of the painting have altered over time. The background was once blue – the black is almost certainly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQO-0008-0000-0000.htm">overpaint</a> – and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">houpelande</span> was a purplish-brown, with vertical pleats across the chest. The gilded frame, which is original, was cleaned in the 1950s. The sides are carved from the same piece of wood as the panel. The top and bottom are separate, and are attached with round pegs: we can see their indents, especially in the word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ich</span>. Similar frames are found on four other surviving paintings by van Eyck, and were perhaps made by the same carpenter. Van Eyck’s motto, his signature and the date are painted to look as if they have been carved into the frame. The bottom inscription is in abbreviated Latin: JOH[ANN]ES DE EYCK ME FECIT AN[N]O M° CCCC° 33° 21 OCTOBRIS (’Jan van Eyck made me on 21 October 1433').  Although a masterly painter, van Eyck was not always a masterly planner. We can see where the ruling of the guidelines for his signature has slipped and been redone, and that he has almost run out of space, so that the letters for October are squeezed in at the end with no room for a full stop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The back of the panel is now covered with a thin layer of black paint. This is not original, but the back was always intended to be painted: a small area of chalk <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, probably a preparation for the original paint, can be seen towards the lower edge. In the fifteenth century the backs of portraits were often painted. This would have helped prevent the panel warping or cracking by reducing the amount of moisture it could lose or absorb. It might also have been decorative: paintings were not always hung on walls, but were sometimes kept in boxes or bags and displayed on special occasions, meaning that the backs would have been visible.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This must be one of the most famous paintings in the world, and one of the most intriguing. A richly dressed man and woman stand in a private room. Although it looks as if <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> painted a real room exactly as he saw it, every object has been carefully chosen to proclaim the couple’s wealth and social status without risking criticism for aping the aristocracy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The house is of brick. Its window opens onto a garden, and a cherry tree can be glimpsed through the open shutters. The large and luxurious bed is covered with expensive red woollen cloth, and red cushions and fabric are scattered on the bedside chair and the bench. This is not a bedroom but a reception room, and the bed – the most expensive item of furniture in the house – is an essential part of its furnishings. The chair and bench are ornately carved, an oriental carpet lies on the floor and a splendid brass chandelier hangs from the ceiling. Even the carelessly scattered oranges indicate wealth; such fruit was extremely expensive. But this is not a palace: the floor is boarded and the walls are plastered rather than panelled or hung with tapestries. We are looking into a reception room in the comfortable, modern mansion of a wealthy merchant.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The room’s restrained luxury is equalled by the careful sartorial splendour of the couple. Their clothes are expensive and fashionable, but not flashy. The man wears a hat of plaited straw, and a dark tabard, probably of silk velvet, trimmed with brown fur. Under it is a black, possibly silk, doublet, with silver cuffs. His muddy pattens (overshoes) lie discarded on the floor.  The woman wears a fine green wool overdress with elaborate dagged sleeves and a long train which falls in thick folds around her feet. It is trimmed with a white fur, possibly ermine or squirrel belly. She is not pregnant, though she might look it: she is holding up her bulky gown in front of her, as ladies commonly did. Her hair is caught up in fashionable but modest horns, held in red nets, and covered with an intricately folded veil.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So who are the people in this intimate setting? They are clearly husband and wife, and for many years the painting was understood as representing a marriage ceremony, though not anymore. From early on the painting was identified as showing one ‘Hernoul le Fin’ or ‘Arnoult Fin’. The Arnolfini were an extensive family of Italian merchants, with various members in Bruges at this period. The most likely candidate is Giovanni di Nicolao di Arnolfini, known as Giannino or Jehannin, who would have been in his late thirties in 1434. The lady is probably his second wife, whose identity is unknown. They may have been friends of van Eyck – he painted another portrait of the man at an older age (Staatliche Museen, Berlin). A large round mirror hangs right in the centre of the composition, its convex glass showing not just the compressed and contorted room but also two men coming in through a door behind us. The first man seems to be raising his left arm and stepping down steps from the passage. Immediately above the mirror is a flamboyant signature: Johannes de Eyck fuit hic. 1434 (‘Jan van Eyck was here. 1434’). Are the men in the mirror van Eyck himself and his servant, arriving on a visit?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis tell us much about how the picture was made. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> was done in stages. In the first one van Eyck sketched in the figures, the main pieces of furniture and the basic architecture of the room, but left out many of the objects for which the painting is now famous: the watchful terrier, the chandelier, the chair, the beads hanging on the wall and the discarded shoes. These were painted in at a late stage. Van Eyck also altered the man and woman’s faces and bodies. In the initial underdrawing, Arnolfini had a larger face and even odder features. His feet were in a different position, his robe was shorter and his hat larger. His wife originally looked up towards her husband and her features were lower, so her forehead seemed even higher. Van Eyck often manipulated his sitters‘ appearance to emphasise heads and hands, but here the faces, especially the man’s, have been altered substantially. Arnolfini must have been a strange-looking man, and in the second underdrawing van Eyck improved his proportions and idealised his features.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Even the room itself if not a literal record of the couple’s home. Although it looks as if van Eyck has simply removed a wall, close examination reveals inconsistencies. The chandelier cannot fit into the space it seems to occupy; there is no sign of a fireplace; the bed is too short and the ornate convex mirror on the back wall seems impossibly large. As usual, van Eyck created a perfectly convincing show of reality but altered things to fit his aesthetic purposes and perhaps also to accord with Arnolfini’s aspirations.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, there is nothing unusual in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> used – this illusion of reality relied on van Eyck’s skill, not on any technical innovation. Look closely and you can see an astonishing level of detail. The oranges reflect in the polished wood of the casement, and the beads hanging by the bed cast both shadows and reflections on the wall behind. For a painting that seems so precise, it was surprisingly quickly and freely painted. Van Eyck was almost bouncing the paintbrush off the panel to get small touches of colour, and he used his fingers and the brush handles as well as the points of the brushes. We can see his thumbprint by the shadow of the dog’s leg, and the bristles of the brush hanging by the bed are scratched into the paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting has a fascinating afterlife. By the sixteenth century it was in the hands of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Margaret of Austria</a>, Regent of the Netherlands. From her, it migrated into the Spanish royal collection. It next appears in the possession of James Hay, a Scottish soldier who was in Spain during the Peninsular War (1807–14). We don’t know how Hay got it, but he brought it back to England and it was bought by the National Gallery in 1842 for ‘the moderate price’ of 600 Guineas. It was our first Netherlandish painting.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting tells the traditional Christmas story – how <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> was born in a stable, and his mother ‘laid him in a manger, because there was no room for them at the inn’ (Luke 2: 7). The infant Christ, lying in the manger, is watched over by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> and adoring angels, while an ox and donkey peer out of the darkness behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Bible goes on to describe how shepherds were watching their flocks at night when ‘an angel of the Lord stood by them, and the brightness of God shone round them’ (Luke 2: 9). Through the crumbling back wall of the stable we see them, huddled around a fire, their dog beside them. They gaze up in awe at the shining angel. One shields his eyes with his red cloak; another kneels, throwing up his hands in wonder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene in the stable is lit by the divine glow of the Christ Child; the rays would once have been more visible. This idea comes from the writings of the popular fourteenth-century mystic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Bridget of Sweden</a>, who described the birth of Christ: ’she gave birth to her son, from whom radiated such an ineffable light and splendour, that the sun was not comparable to it, nor did the candle that Saint Joseph had put there, give any light at all, the divine light totally annihilating the material light of the candle.'</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture has almost universally been attributed to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PIK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Geertgen tot Sint Jans</a>. It is closest in style to paintings normally assigned to the later years of his short career and was possibly painted in about 1490. The idea of the night scene lit in this way was not Geertgen’s – it was based on two lost night-time <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a> scenes by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hugo van der Goes</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small painting was probably made for private devotional use. Although less complex and ambitious than the lost work by van der Goes, it is perhaps more touching. The divine glow from the infant Christ is a pocket of light in the darkness, creating a sense of intimacy and awe which draws us into the scene. The artist has carefully differentiated the different sources of light: the child in the manger, the fire and the angel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was once more colourful, as well as larger. It has darkened so much it is hard to make out some of the details, like the basket hanging from the beam in the top right corner or the sheaf of corn leaning against the back wall. It was cut down to its present size in 1901 and was damaged by fire in 1904 while it was in a private collection in Berlin. The extreme heat may have made the paint bubble, and caused the many tiny round losses, visible in the Virgin’s forehead for example. Colours have changed: the Virgin’s dress and mantle were once different shades of blue but now look black, as does the sky.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting belonged to Isabella of Castile, Queen of Spain, and was listed with 46 companion panels in an inventory of part of her estate in 1505. The panels – 27 survive in various collections – are all the same size and most show scenes from the lives of Christ and the Virgin. They were produced by Isabella’s court painters, Michael Sittow and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PSZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan de Flandes</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, dressed in blue, here sits at the end of a large bed. An illuminated manuscript lies open at her feet, and in the front corner a grey and a white dove feed from the space left by a missing tile. The resurrected <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, displaying the wounds of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a> and carrying a golden cross on a long silvery staff, greets her. He is accompanied by the multitude he has brought out of limbo. Behind him are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam and Eve</a> while on his left is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>. The elderly man and woman beside the bed are perhaps Mary’s parents. Scrolls – the medieval equivalent of speech bubbles – come from the mouths of Christ, Saint John and the Virgin. The words are Latin quotations from either the Bible or devotional literature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The episode shown here is not found in the Bible. The painter may have followed the account of the meeting between the Virgin and the risen Christ in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Vita Christi</span> (‘Life of Christ’), a fifteenth-century Catalan devotional text written by an abbess, Sor Isabel de Villena. Sor Isabel was related to Ferdinand of Aragon and Isabella of Castile and her book was dedicated to Isabella, who perhaps recommended it to whoever advised the artists.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although there are stylistic and technical differences between the surviving panels – some, like this one, have <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> but some don't, some are darker in colour than others, and figures are on different scales in different panels – it seems likely that de Flandes did most of them after he arrived in Spain in around 1496. Although the paint surface is worn in places, particularly the inscriptions and the head of Saint John, the undamaged parts, such as Christ’s face and wounds, are painted with very great skill. The minute catchlights in the Virgin’s eyes even differ in colour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s not clear exactly what the paintings were for. Isabella died at Medina del Campo in November 1504 and her executors were directed to sell most of her belongings to pay her legacies. In February 1505 the officials preparing the inventory of her estate listed 47 little panels in a cupboard at the castle of Toro. Isabella did not actually live at Toro; it seems that the panels were brought there, along with many of her possessions, merely to be valued and sold. They were not arranged in any logical order and although they form a fairly complete cycle, it is possible that one or more were missing: 47 is an awkward number and there is no image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>. The panels were sold separately: Isabella’s daughter-in-law <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Margaret of Austria</a> obtained 32 of them, and kept them in a wooden box before having two made into a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting had a gilded border, and traces of borders remain on others in the series. It is likely that all had similar borders which would have acted as frames. They probably were intended to be used singly or in small groups as aids to private devotion.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A pale young man, hands folded in prayer, is engaged in private devotions. The book is presumably a prayer book or a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Book of Hours</a>. It has gilded edges and a golden clasp, and the text written in black ink with red rubrics (instructions) and blue initials. The portrait was clearly the left wing of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a>. The right hand panel(s) would have displayed a religious image, probably the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is nothing to tell us who the sitter was, though he was evidently wealthy. He wears a red velvet doublet with a black robe over it, the right sleeve of which is folded over above his wrist to reveal a dark grey lining with a damask-like pattern. Both gown and doublet are slashed at the shoulder, allowing white puffs of the shirt to escape. A cross set with sapphires and surrounded by pearls hangs from the gold chain around his neck. His dress and haircut suggest a date of around 1475.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two coloured marble columns have golden capitals and bases. Although they don't relate convincingly to the figure or the surface on which his book rests, they suggest a luxurious setting. They are comparable to those in Memling’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0JS7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0JRF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Lawrence</a></span>, of before or around 1480. In those, however, the spatial relationships between the young man and his setting are more carefully considered, which could indicate that this painting is rather earlier. It may be dated to the mid-1470s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis shows us that there was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> for the face and neck, probably indicating roughly where the head was to be. The lines in the hands and book are more confusing but probably record various ideas for the placing of the hands, which were narrower at one stage, and for the surface on which the book rests and the book itself, which may once have been larger. The underdrawing resembles that in other portraits by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Memling</a>. The final positions of the face, hands and book were all fixed before the artist began to paint; few changes were made at the painting stage. The delicacy of detail and the skill of handling, particularly noticeable in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> passages, is typical of Memling.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the figure is in very good condition, the background has been damaged and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQO-0008-0000-0000.htm">overpainted</a>. The frame, which is apparently original, has lost its original <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> and decoration; the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilded</a> strips are modern. It is not clear what its original decoration would have been. Both the mouldings and the structure of this frame are unusual but have some technical features in common with frames manufactured in Bruges around 1480.</p></div>

Here, the <a href="/paintings/glossary/virgin-mary">Virgin Mary</a> and <a href="/paintings/glossary/saint-john-the-evangelist">Saint John the Evangelist</a> are recognisable as the central characters. <a href="/paintings/glossary/mary-magdalene">Mary Magdalene</a> is the more sumptuously dressed woman in gold and <a href="/paintings/glossary/saint-peter">Saint Peter</a> is the figure in white in the foreground.<br/><br/>'The Ascension' was part of a series of 47 devotional panels painted for the Catholic Queen Isabella of Castile, showing scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin. Only 27 of these now survive, the majority of which are thought to have been painted by Juan de Flandes or his studio.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young lady in an extravagant green dress sits on the floor, reading. Although she wears fifteenth-century clothing and is in a medieval room, she is a biblical figure: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a>. Her figure forms a semi-circle, with her head and legs curving around her bent knees, emphasising her absorption in her book. This use of geometric harmonies to express feeling is typical of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a fragment of a larger painting, and you can see parts of other figures: a man leaning on a stick behind Mary and another kneeling to the left, his toes poking out from under his voluminous robe. She sits on a red cushion and leans against a carved wooden cabinet. Her overdress is lined with grey fur and cinched in tight around her waist. It falls in bulky folds around her legs, and is turned back so that we can see her cloth of gold underdress. Her loose hair is covered with a white veil, fluted at the edges and tucked behind her ears; this is not the fashionable headdress worn by contemporary ladies – as seen in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXH-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman</a></span> by Robert Campin – but something more suited to a figure from biblical times.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She seems to be reading a Bible, written in two columns with large red and blue initials marking different chapters. It is a luxurious volume: the fore-edges and clasps are gilded and it is covered with a white <span class="dokuwiki_italic">chemise</span>, a kind of book jacket which was wrapped around special books to protect them. Look closely and you can see the stitching along the upper edge of the binding and the minuscule cord bookmarks wrapped around the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pipe</span>. The saint’s attribute, the pot containing the oil she used to anoint Christ’s feet, stands on the floor beside her, casting a strong shadow. By the Middle Ages Mary Magdalene had become a conflation of various biblical stories. The sinful woman who had washed Christ’s feet with her tears and anointed them with oil (Luke 7: 36–38) was combined with Mary of Bethany, sister of Lazarus, who ’seated herself at the Lord’s feet and listened to his word‘ (Luke 10: 38–42). She was understood as an example of the contemplative life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Through a window at the back of the room we can see a river winding lazily past, and people walking its banks. On the near bank an archer in a short purple robe and a red hat aims a crossbow. On the far side a man in red and black is followed by a woman in a black hat, white overdress kilted up over a red underdress; you can see her reflection in the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was originally the lower right corner of what must have been a large altarpiece of the Virgin and Child with saints, painted for a church in Brussels. It was possibly one of van der Weyden’s first commissions after he settled there in 1435. A fifteenth-century sketch of it (now in the Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) allows us to reconstruct what it originally looked like. The man with the stick and the amber beads behind Mary is Saint Joseph; his head survives  in the Fundaçāo Calouste Gulbenkian, Lisbon (along with the head of another female saint, perhaps Saint Catherine). The Virgin and Child would have been seated in the centre, with a youthful Saint John the Evangelist kneeling to their left – it is his toes and parts of his robe that survive in our painting. Saint Catherine and a standing bishop would have appeared on their right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know when the altarpiece was cut up, but in the early nineteenth century the background around Mary Magdalene was painted over in brown (this was removed when the picture was cleaned in 1955). Technical analysis has shown no major changes between the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and the final painted version, so the composition must have been worked out fully in preliminary drawings. The underdrawing itself is very assured: the lines were boldly and quickly executed, and Mary was drawn freehand with great skill and clarity. Rogier and his assistants recycled several figures from the composition of which this once formed part in other paintings, and Mary herself appears in reverse in his Seven Sacraments Altarpiece (Royal Museum of Fine Arts, Antwerp). Rogier clearly made preliminary studies for the figures, and retained and reused them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The extraordinary technical sophistication of the figures and landscape and the attention to detail are typical of van der Weyden. Mary’s lips are painted with various mixtures of vermilion, white and red lake, striped <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> into one another. For the fur edging of her dress, various tones of grey, from pure black to nearly pure white, were painted in parallel stripes and then dragged while still wet to produce the furry texture. Many of the details – the ruling of Mary’s book and its fine, coloured bookmarks, and a fleur-de-lis, just over 1 millimetre high, painted on the shoe of the archer by the river – must have been almost invisible when the painting was on its altar. Other areas – the cupboard (though not its metal fittings) and nail heads in the floor – are less carefully executed and could well be by assistants.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are looking at the east end of a Gothic church, where the body of a bishop is being exhumed from his tomb in front of the high altar. This is Saint Hubert, Bishop of Maastricht and Liège, who died in 727. He is being moved from Liège to the newly founded abbey of Saint-Hubert-en-Ardenne, in 825. Although he has been dead 98 years, his body is in perfect condition – proof of his sainthood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of two surviving panels from a series of the life of Saint Hubert, painted for the chapel of Saint Hubert in the church of Saint Gudula in Brussels (now the cathedral of Saints Michael and Gudula). It was probably commissioned when the chapel was founded in the 1430s and includes portraits of the founders and their family members in the crowd clustered around the grave.</p></div>

This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Hubert</a>, Bishop of Maastricht and Liège, who died in 727. This was the second time his tomb had been opened; here, he is being moved from Liège to the newly founded abbey of Saint-Hubert-en-Ardenne, in 825. Although he has been dead 98 years, his body has not rotted – proof of his sainthood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of two surviving panels from a series of the life of Saint Hubert, painted for the saint’s chapel in the church of Saint Gudula in Brussels (now the cathedral of Saints Michael and Gudula); the other is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Dream of Pope Sergius</span> (J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles). The series was probably commissioned when the chapel was founded in the 1430s by Jan Vrientschap, a wealthy Brussels property owner, and his brother-in-law Jan Coels, a money-changer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Historical and contemporary characters crowd around the open grave. The bishop swinging a censer (incense burner) is presumably Walcaud, Bishop of Liège, who supervised the exhumation. Behind him is Louis the Pious (778–840), King of the Franks and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a>. His robe is decorated with the blue and gold fleur-de-lis of France juxtaposed with the imperial eagle. On the right, in profile, is Adelbald, Archbishop of Cologne, who gave permission for Hubert to be moved to his new resting place.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Apart from Louis and the courtier immediately behind him, whose beards indicate that they are from the remote past, and the clerics taking part in the exhumation, the crowd wears contemporary dress. Some peer over each other’s shoulders to get a glimpse of the saint’s body, others chat. Some may be portraits of the painting’s commissioners and members of their families. Vrientschap and his wife Catharina might be the elderly couple on the left, with their three eldest sons behind them and their two youngest in front. Coels might be the man craning his head to see at the right of the altar, with his wife, another Catharina, beside him and his illegitimate son Hendrick at the far right. The priest standing between them may be Gillis Coels, the chapel’s first priest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But many of these people were not originally part of the picture; the decision to include them appears to have been made at a late stage and involved radical reorganisation of the composition. Although the painting was designed and in part executed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, he was apparently too busy to give it his full attention. Once he had made studies for the central group he seems to have delegated the work to assistants, some of whom were perhaps not yet fully trained to work in his style. Some of the surrounding group are out of scale and are lit from different angles; many of the heads are painted in different techniques.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rogier may have intervened again before the painting was finished: the two boys on the left are almost certainly his work. They were painted with tremendous skill and confidence, directly over the red robe of Louis' attendant.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young man with very dark hair and brown eyes seems to be reading a paper covered in elaborate writing. He wears a purplish-grey robe  trimmed with brown fur, and the black scarf over his shoulder is attached to his hat, which is hanging down his back. The paper he holds is out of perspective. It has been folded and unfolded, and the writing is a kind of imaginary cursive which is not and never was legible. The document is almost certainly a letter, although the places where the name of the recipient would have appeared are concealed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The studded wooden shutters on the window behind him have been partly flung back to reveal a delightfully detailed landscape. A stone bridge arches across a river, linking the town on the bank with a walled fortress up on the hill. A large church is reflected in the water and red-roofed houses line the bank. If you look closely you can make out a large rowing boat on the river and tiny figures crossing the bridge, one on horseback. Another man on a white horse rides up the winding road towards the castle, past a row of pollarded trees. A woman in a white veil and a man with a bundle on a stick climb the path running alongside the road. Under the trees to the left a small outdoor party is taking place: a fashionably dressed man and woman and two smaller figures, perhaps children, are being entertained by a musician who seems to be playing the bagpipes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For many years the main figure was thought to be Saint Ivo, patron saint of lawyers, known as the advocate of the poor. He once had a halo and there used to be an inscription in the upper right hand corner naming him as such, but these were later additions. Saint Ivo was usually shown wearing a lawyer’s robes and holding a scroll, book or paper. He was often accompanied by paupers presenting petition. This picture was painted in the Netherlands in the mid-fifteenth century, when Saint Ivo appears not to have been especially widely venerated there. He became better known from the end of the sixteenth century when his relics were brought to Antwerp. The painting might be either an image of the saint made when his iconography was not fully understood or a different subject transformed into the saint when his cult was gaining popularity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If this is not Saint Ivo, it’s difficult to propose an alternative. The letter should but does not help solve the problem; the incidents in the background are mysterious and not necessarily related to each other or to the main figure. If this is a portrait, it is a totally unconventional one as fifteenth-century sitters were not shown engaged in activities in this way. It is clearly not a fragment of a larger painting – the bare strip of wood around the edge was covered by the original frame – but may have been part of a series or a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>. The composition, with the sitter looking towards the left, seems to need something to balance it on the right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although it is very much in the style of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, the painting is the work of someone who was a less skilled draughtsman. There are various anomalies in the way it is painted: the eyes are at uneven heights, the hands are awkward and oddly boneless, and the folded paper is out of shape. It is the work of an imitator, or perhaps an assistant, and has points in common with the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triptych of Saint John the Baptist</span> (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), which was also probably by an associate.</p></div>
