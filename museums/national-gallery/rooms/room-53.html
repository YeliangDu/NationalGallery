This is Bernardijn Salviati, illegitimate son of a Florentine merchant, and canon of the Collegiate Church of Saint Donatian in Bruges (he died in 1519). The same outfit is worn by his friend and fellow canon, Richard der Capelle, in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FW6-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saints are, from left to right: Martin of Tours, with the beggar he gave his cloak to on the road behind him; the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> Bernardino of Siena, Bernardijn’s name saint, in a grey habit; and Donatian, patron saint of Bernardijn’s church. The panel, which originally had an arched top, was almost certainly the left wing of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> commissioned for the chapel of Saint John the Baptist and Mary Magdalene at Saint Donatian’s, which Bernardijn was given permission to restore in January 1501. The other part of the diptych is probably a scene of the Crucifixion now in the Staatliche Museen, Berlin. On the back of our panel is a ruined picture apparently showing the resurrected Christ at an open window, which would have been visible when the diptych was closed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bernardijn was the son of Borromeo Salviati, who was from a noble Florentine family and probably the manager of the Bruges branch of the Salviati company in the mid-1460s. His mother Christine was from a well-to-do Flemish family, the van Rossems. Born in the 1460s, Bernardijn trained as a lawyer and worked a good deal for the Italian communities in Bruges. His association with Saint Donatian’s church seems to have begun in the late 1480s, and he held a series of positions there, becoming a canon in 1498. He was one of a circle of Italian and Dutch patrons in Bruges, and was a good patron of David’s. He was perhaps instrumental in securing for him the commission for <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FW6-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donor</a></span>; he seems to have known the donor personally.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bernardijn seems to have been an endearing character, a generous and humorous man fond of good living. For example, he drew comical musical notation in the church’s minutes relating to a sung mass. At his death he was living with six friends or relatives, and had a good deal of silver, some engraved with his family’s coat of arms, quantities of wine and some expensive clothes. He bequeathed works of art to two women: a statue of Mary Magdalene to the Prioress of the convent of Sion, and a diptych of himself and the Virgin to a widow named Martine (a relationship which perhaps casts light on the otherwise unexplained presence of Saint Martin in our panel). He was also devoted to his mother, and was buried beside her in a tomb for which he had commissioned a brass showing them together.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Even his altarpiece might reflect his maternal affection. He clearly had an interest in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a>: he owned a statue of her and had the chapel he endowed re-dedicated to her; she is the central figure in the Crucifixion panel in Berlin, and also appears on Saint Martin’s cope in this painting. Could Mary Magdalene, a repentant sinner, have been an inspiration for his unmarried mother, a devotion continued by her son?</p></div>

His face is red, and he seems to be gritting his teeth as he looks at us to invite our compassion. Lying on the ground is Christ’s coat – in the Bible, the soldiers cast lots for it (John 18: 24) – and a dog sniffs at a skull. According to the Gospels, Christ was crucified at Golgotha, ‘the place of the skull’. Traditionally the skull was thought to be that of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam</a>, the first man; Christ was seen as the second Adam who came to redeem humanity’s sins through his sacrifice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David borrowed and adapted motifs from other artists, in particular <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a>, assembling them like a jigsaw to make a new whole. He did not invent this composition but adapted it from an earlier image. The nailing of Christ to the Cross was not described in the Bible, but was found in devotional literature and was a popular subject for illuminated manuscripts. Miniatures in French and Netherlandish manuscripts include several of the figures in this scene, perhaps reflecting a lost original. The group of horsemen who come into view in the upper left, the skull and the dog sniffing at it may derive (possibly via a drawing) from an image of the Crucifixion associated with Jan van Eyck (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David had a particular ability to humanise and individualise sacred subjects, and technical investigations show how he achieved this here. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectograms</a> reveal many small changes between the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and the final painted version.

This is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a> (Matthew 2: 11), when the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> followed a star from the east and found Christ in a stable in Bethlehem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a palatial but ruined building, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits with the Christ Child on her lap. She holds a golden goblet containing gold coins, the lid of which lies at her feet. This is the gift of the elderly king, Caspar, who kneels before her, his hat and sceptre on the ground. His name is inscribed on the lid in gilded letters which cast shadows against a concave outer ring. Christ takes one of the coins in his left hand. The second king, Melchior, stands behind Caspar on the right, and carries frankincense in an elaborate golden vessel. Opposite him the third king approaches. His name runs around the top of his hat: BALTAZAR. His gift of myrrh is contained in a golden vessel decorated with naked babies. The gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh are thought to symbolise respectively tribute, sacrifice and burying of the dead. On a capital above Caspar’s head is a representation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELC-0008-0000-0000.htm">sacrifice of Isaac</a>, which prefigures the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between Balthasar and the Virgin, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Joseph</a> leans on his staff and gazes up at the angels hovering in the air above. Behind him, an ox pokes its head through a doorway in which stands another angel. A nearby donkey munches weeds. Directly behind Caspar are two shepherds, one carrying a musical instrument, the other holding a straw hat and an implement used for herding sheep. In the distance we see the same shepherds receiving the news of Christ’s birth. Like the kings, they have come to adore the Christ Child (Luke 2: 8–18). The star which guided the kings shines above the stable and the dove of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> hovers below it, as angels fill the sky. Some of the kings‘ retinue crowd in behind them, while others on horseback can be seen through the window on our right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jean Gossart</a> has signed the painting in two places: once on Balthasar’s hat, and once on the silver collar of his attendant. Technical analysis has revealed the skill, time and effort that Gossart put into this picture. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectograms</a> show considerable amounts of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and a great many changes made at all stages. The main lines of the architecture are ruled but the rest of the drawing is freehand, with no indications that any kind of mechanical transfer was used. The drawing is detailed, down to knuckles and fingernails, wrinkles in clothes and patterns on textiles. Gossart often drew several lines to get the right contour, for example in Caspar’s nose. Heads, faces and clothes were changed; almost all the architecture was altered when the painting was nearly finished and some figures were painted directly on top of whatever is behind them, including the ox, the donkey, Caspar’s sceptre and the lid of his goblet. The broken tiles in the floor and the plants growing through were all added after the grid of the floor, itself laid out only after the main figures had been blocked in. All the underdrawing and changes appear to be by Gossart himself, even down to the hasty painting of subsidiary heads – there are no obvious interventions by assistants.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In order to extend the range of colour and tone, Gossart has mixed and layered his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> in unusually complex ways, undermodelling some colours in different tones of grey. A fingerprint on the green robe of the angel behind the ox shows that Gossart blotted the glaze with his finger. There are virtuoso passages of detail, especially in the foreground: the hairs sprouting from Caspar’s cheek and the decoration of his hat; the fringes of Balthasar’s stole.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gossart drew on several sources, most importantly the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Montforte Altarpiece</span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hugo van der Goes</a> (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) which inspired the magnificently dressed kings and attendants, the broken architecture and the flying angels. But Gossart took Hugo’s views through ruined buildings to distant landscapes a step further, opening up a vast recession towards distant mountains in the centre of his painting. Other elements – the dogs, and details of dress – are drawn from prints by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Martin Schongauer</a>. Gossart transformed them into a composition that is entirely his own: the dog on the right has an almost quivering alertness that is not taken from Dürer. Gossart’s command of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil painting</a> technique and his mastery of light allowed him to make its eye sparkle and its nose and whiskers twitch.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The geometrical arrangement of the composition gives the picture its powerful structure. The painting is divided into two horizontal registers: the heavenly zone of the star, dove and angels, and the earthly zone of the Virgin and Child, the kings and shepherds. The figures in each do not overlap, but the zones are united by the strong verticals of the architecture, stressed by the sudden contrasts of light and shade. The architecture makes no structural sense, but serves to emphasise verticals in the lower zone: Balthasar’s gift and the ends of his scarf line up with the section of wall behind, as do the strongly lit folds hanging from the Virgin’s right knee. Heavenly and earthly figures echo each other: Caspar’s pose is not unlike that of the angel in pink immediately above him, while his shape is echoed by the dog in the right hand corner. The figures inhabit a deep space, the sense of recession emphasised by their relative positions on the squares of the floor. The strong diagonal recession between Balthasar and Melchior is highlighted by the fact that they reflect and reverse each other’s poses, and the pinks and greens of their outfits make a sort of counterpoint. Another strong diagonal leads up from the dog in the lower right corner to Caspar and the Virgin. The Virgin’s face sits at the mathematical centre of the composition: the vanishing points of the perspectival systems are to the right of her head, near the shepherd who stands behind the donkey. Gossart changed the original brilliant red of his hat to a dull green-brown, presumably to make him less obtrusive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By 1600 this large painting was perhaps in the abbey of St Adrian at Geraardsbergen (Graamont) in East Flanders. Gossart seems to have painted it for the church between about 1510 and 1515, probably for the funerary chapel of Daniel van Boechout, lord of Boelare near Geraardsbergen. At this time the artist was in the service of Philip of Burgundy, Bishop of Utrecht, with whom von Boechout was closely associated: he was a member of his council, governor of his main residence and an executor of his will. Gossart probably knew von Boechout well: he had stayed in Philip’s properties on his way to Rome in 1508–9. The unusual splendour of the kings’ robes here might even be connected with its original location, as among the relics in the abbey’s collection in 1519 was ‘ a piece of clothing of one of the Three Kings’.</p></div>

His name runs around the top of his hat: BALTAZAR. His gift of myrrh is contained in a golden vessel decorated with naked babies. The gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh are thought to symbolise respectively tribute, sacrifice and burying of the dead. On a capital above Caspar’s head is a representation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELC-0008-0000-0000.htm">sacrifice of Isaac</a>, which prefigures the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between Balthasar and the Virgin, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Joseph</a> leans on his staff and gazes up at the angels hovering in the air above. Behind him, an ox pokes its head through a doorway in which stands another angel. A nearby donkey munches weeds. Directly behind Caspar are two shepherds, one carrying a musical instrument, the other holding a straw hat and an implement used for herding sheep. In the distance we see the same shepherds receiving the news of Christ’s birth. Like the kings, they have come to adore the Christ Child (Luke 2: 8–18). The star which guided the kings shines above the stable and the dove of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> hovers below it, as angels fill the sky. Some of the kings‘ retinue crowd in behind them, while others on horseback can be seen through the window on our right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jean Gossart</a> has signed the painting in two places: once on Balthasar’s hat, and once on the silver collar of his attendant. Technical analysis has revealed the skill, time and effort that Gossart put into this picture. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectograms</a> show considerable amounts of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and a great many changes made at all stages. The main lines of the architecture are ruled but the rest of the drawing is freehand, with no indications that any kind of mechanical transfer was used. The drawing is detailed, down to knuckles and fingernails, wrinkles in clothes and patterns on textiles. Gossart often drew several lines to get the right contour, for example in Caspar’s nose. Heads, faces and clothes were changed; almost all the architecture was altered when the painting was nearly finished and some figures were painted directly on top of whatever is behind them, including the ox, the donkey, Caspar’s sceptre and the lid of his goblet. The broken tiles in the floor and the plants growing through were all added after the grid of the floor, itself laid out only after the main figures had been blocked in. All the underdrawing and changes appear to be by Gossart himself, even down to the hasty painting of subsidiary heads – there are no obvious interventions by assistants.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In order to extend the range of colour and tone, Gossart has mixed and layered his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> in unusually complex ways, undermodelling some colours in different tones of grey. A fingerprint on the green robe of the angel behind the ox shows that Gossart blotted the glaze with his finger. There are virtuoso passages of detail, especially in the foreground: the hairs sprouting from Caspar’s cheek and the decoration of his hat; the fringes of Balthasar’s stole.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gossart drew on several sources, most importantly the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Montforte Altarpiece</span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hugo van der Goes</a> (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin) which inspired the magnificently dressed kings and attendants, the broken architecture and the flying angels. But Gossart took Hugo’s views through ruined buildings to distant landscapes a step further, opening up a vast recession towards distant mountains in the centre of his painting. Other elements – the dogs, and details of dress – are drawn from prints by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Martin Schongauer</a>. Gossart transformed them into a composition that is entirely his own: the dog on the right has an almost quivering alertness that is not taken from Dürer. Gossart’s command of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil painting</a> technique and his mastery of light allowed him to make its eye sparkle and its nose and whiskers twitch.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The geometrical arrangement of the composition gives the picture its powerful structure. The painting is divided into two horizontal registers: the heavenly zone of the star, dove and angels, and the earthly zone of the Virgin and Child, the kings and shepherds. The figures in each do not overlap, but the zones are united by the strong verticals of the architecture, stressed by the sudden contrasts of light and shade. The architecture makes no structural sense, but serves to emphasise verticals in the lower zone: Balthasar’s gift and the ends of his scarf line up with the section of wall behind, as do the strongly lit folds hanging from the Virgin’s right knee. Heavenly and earthly figures echo each other: Caspar’s pose is not unlike that of the angel in pink immediately above him, while his shape is echoed by the dog in the right hand corner. The figures inhabit a deep space, the sense of recession emphasised by their relative positions on the squares of the floor. The strong diagonal recession between Balthasar and Melchior is highlighted by the fact that they reflect and reverse each other’s poses, and the pinks and greens of their outfits make a sort of counterpoint. Another strong diagonal leads up from the dog in the lower right corner to Caspar and the Virgin. The Virgin’s face sits at the mathematical centre of the composition: the vanishing points of the perspectival systems are to the right of her head, near the shepherd who stands behind the donkey. Gossart changed the original brilliant red of his hat to a dull green-brown, presumably to make him less obtrusive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By 1600 this large painting was perhaps in the abbey of St Adrian at Geraardsbergen (Graamont) in East Flanders. Gossart seems to have painted it for the church between about 1510 and 1515, probably for the funerary chapel of Daniel van Boechout, lord of Boelare near Geraardsbergen. At this time the artist was in the service of Philip of Burgundy, Bishop of Utrecht, with whom von Boechout was closely associated: he was a member of his council, governor of his main residence and an executor of his will. Gossart probably knew von Boechout well: he had stayed in Philip’s properties on his way to Rome in 1508–9. The unusual splendour of the kings’ robes here might even be connected with its original location, as among the relics in the abbey’s collection in 1519 was ‘ a piece of clothing of one of the Three Kings’.</p></div>

On the other hand, the composition and versatile execution – alternating smoothly painted areas and minute details with more dynamic passages – pay homage to the Netherlandish tradition of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Virgin and Child with the Canon Joris van der Paele</span>; Bruges, Groeningemuseum) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hugo van der Goes</a> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Portinari Altarpiece</span>; Florence, Galleria degli Uffizi).

The dramatically foreshortened faces of the saints and angels are reminiscent of some of his early drawings, for instance the left saint of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Holy Family with Saints</span> (c. 1510-5; Albertina, Vienna). The treatment of the brocade and metalwork compares well with passages from Gossaert’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DF9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a> (London, National Gallery).

However, the facture of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Virgin and Child with Saints Louis and Margaret and Two Angels</span> is generally less crisp, and no definitive conclusions can be drawn from these observations. This painting challenges art historians’ tendency to focus on names and demonstrates that for the late medieval and Renaissance periods, anonymity can intersect with extraordinary quality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the centre of an open-air chapel, the Virgin and Child sit enthroned before a richly embroidered cloth of honour. They are flanked by the canonised King of France Saint Louis; he is clad in blue robes embroidered with the fleur-de-lis and wears the collar of the French royal order of Saint Michael. His individualised features suggest it is a portrait. Opposite is Saint Margaret, sumptuously dressed and rising unharmed from the broken carapace of the frowning, slobbering dragon she defeated. Completing the circle are two angels: one plays a mouth harp while the other holds a song book, inscribed with an identifiable Marian hymn, ‘Ave Regina Caelorum, Mater regis angelorum’. The musical notations, however, are fanciful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If the subject of the Virgin enthroned with angels and saints was nothing new by first decade of the 16th century, its treatment here is wildly inventive; the painting is replete with iconographic oddities. These include the bare wooden steps upon which the Virgin’s throne is set; they stand out dramatically in this splendid setting. The plain timber was probably a symbol of humility, but, secured with prominent nails, it also potently evokes the wood of the cross and Christ’s impending sacrifice. No other example of such imagery is known to survive. Similarly, the squirming figures topping Saint Louis’s sceptre (possibly a Last Judgment) are eccentric for metalwork of the period. The sequined net that adorns Margaret’s braided hair is also unusual, as are her crown of daisies (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">marguerites</span> in French) and the dove resting on her shoulder – an allusion to a little-known passage from <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Golden Legend</span> recounting Margaret’s miraculous crowning by a bird descended from heaven. The angel playing the mouth harp – a sound hardly associated with celestial harmony – is a rare occurrence in medieval iconography. The historiated capitals that top the pilasters behind the holy figures alternate recognisable episodes from the Old Testament (The Drunkenness of Noah, The Grapes of Canaan, Adam and Eve, and Cain and Abel) with more obscure and even surprisingly bawdy subjects (for instance the unruly putto showing us his behind at top right).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seen from below, the figures have been brought to the very edge of the picture plane, lending them great monumentality. This tightly cropped format is original: the panel shows unpainted edges on all its sides. The painter’s ambition to dazzle viewers permeates every inch of the painting, evident in details such as the twisting chain of Margaret’s girdle, the translucent gems of her cross, the loose strand of hair across the Virgin’s chest, or the sliver of light that catches her right cheek.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Examination of the panel via dendrochronology indicates that the painting was executed after 1483. On the other hand, the design of the chain of the Order of Saint Michael worn by Saint Louis, with its double knots or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">aiguillettes</span>, was modified by Francis I in 1516, implying that the picture was painted before that year. A dating of about 1510 seems appropriate on stylistic grounds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was first documented in 1602 in the urban priory of the Premonstratensian Abbey of Drongen (Tronchiennes) in Ghent, when the figures of Saints Louis and Margaret were drawn by the painter Antonio de Succa on the mistaken assumption that they were royal portraits. Whether the priory was the painting’s original location is unknown, but the choice of saints would not be inappropriate. The Premonstratensians had particular reverence for Saint Louis because he had granted them the right to bear the fleur-de-lis in their coat-of-arms. In 1608, the monks consecrated an altar devoted to the Virgin and Saint Margaret at the Ghent priory, perhaps reflecting pre-existing devotional interests. The swan, which appears among the grotesque ornaments on the right pilaster, was the main feature of the monastery’s arms.</p></div>
