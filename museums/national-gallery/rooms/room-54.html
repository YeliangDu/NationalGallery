        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> stares calmly out at us from the heart of this picture, his serenity a vivid contrast to the brutality of the men around him. This painting combines two episodes from Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>: the mocking and the crowning with thorns. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P94-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bosch</a> drew on all four Gospel accounts of Christ’s humiliation and contemporary devotional literature which tell how he was first insulted and spat at in the houses of the Jewish priests. Next, after his trial before the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, he was dressed in rich clothes by Roman soldiers, who plaited a crown of thorns and put it on his head. They mocked him, saying ‘Hail, King of the Jews!’, and spat on and struck him. Finally they removed the cloak and led him away to be crucified.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bosch has compressed different phases of the action into a single picture. The men at the back, who wear pieces of armour, seem to be soldiers: one grasps a stick while the other, in green, holds up the crown, his hand protected by a mail glove. The two men in front kneel in mock homage; one seems about to tear off Christ’s robe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the only painting of Christ mocked now known that can be attributed to Bosch, and its upright format is highly unusual. It can‘t have been easy to imagine a half-length version of this scene, and it may have been inspired by the half-length narrative compositions of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hugo van der Goes</a>. Bosch clearly expended an enormous amount of effort on designing the picture – it’s carefully structured through shape and colour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ seems smallest, but the figures are all on the same scale and are layered into three planes: the men at the top are furthest away, with Christ in front of them and the two at the bottom in the foreground. All four gaze inwards at Christ, focusing our attention on him. The hands are intriguing, with seven forming an almost vertical line down the middle of the picture, while Christ’s right eye is on the central vertical axis, helping to give his head dominance. The composition’s geometry gives it stability: Christ’s body forms an inner triangle, while a larger one is made up of the iron gauntlet and the angle of his head and left shoulder; the diagonal of the arrow parallels the iron gauntlet. The slant of stave held by the soldier echoes the fall of Christ’s robe across his body, while the red sleeves and hands of the man on the lower right parallel the second stave. Colours add both balance and meaning. The strong green of the man in the top left is echoed in the oak leaves in the top right, and complemented by the pinks and reds that dominate the lower part of the picture. The paleness of Christ’s robe – it has always been white, no traces of faded red pigments have been found – sets him apart from his colourful enemies and emphasises his vulnerability.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the tormentors wear <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> dress, their clothes would have seemed old fashioned or exotic around 1510, when this picture was painted, possibly to stress their difference from the painting’s intended audience. The star and crescent on the red hood of the man in the lower left corner perhaps connects him with the Eastern Mediterranean. The oak leaves in the hat of the man in the top right are enigmatic but may have been associated with pagan rituals; they were perhaps a late addition, as they are painted over the top of the hat and the man’s forehead. Other objects were perhaps symbolic. One soldier has an arrow in his headdress, of a kind designed for hunting: its chisel-shaped tip would have hamstrung the hunted animal, allowing the hounds to catch it. The other wears a spiked collar, suggesting not only his savagery but also the widespread late medieval characterisation of Christ’s tormentors as dogs, based on Psalm 21: 17: ’For many dogs have encompassed me.‘ Christ is clearly to be disabled and mauled before being killed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The four men crowding in on the pale figure of Christ create a claustrophobic atmosphere, fraught with threat – but Bosch actually toned down the violence of the scene. Technical analysis shows that in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> the bearded man on the lower left was pointing to his mouth, probably to show he had been spitting or shouting at Christ. The hands of the man on the lower right originally clutched at the edge of Christ’s mantle as if to tear it off. The man in the top right corner had sharp spikes in his staff and grasped Christ’s shoulder with his hand. The hand as it is now was painted on top of the paint layer beneath: you can see the line of Christ’s shoulder running through the fingers. The changes make the picture both more interesting and ambiguous. The tormentors’ expressions are open to varying interpretations: cruel or compassionate, sinister or anxious. The crown of thorns makes the shape of a halo, as well as being an instrument of torture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is basically in good condition, although some of the colours have changed: red lake glazes have faded and some of the copper green glazes are turning brown. In places the paint is very thin, so that the underdrawing and pentimenti can clearly be seen, especially in lighter areas such as Christ’s robe. Bosch handled the paint with extraordinary skill. In many places, for example in the armour and the hat of the man in the top right corner, it is worked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> and then dragged or feathered with dry brushes. Bosch’s amazing skills as a painter, designer and colourist are well demonstrated in this picture, which is obviously by the same artist as the famous <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Garden of Earthly Delights</span> (Museo del Prado, Madrid). Curiously, underneath this image of Christ is an unfinished painting of Saint Christopher carrying the Christ Child on his shoulder, which – although rather different in style and technique – is probably also by Bosch.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>  sits in front of a dilapidated stable with the naked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> on her knee. Around her, three men offer golden gifts – this is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a>, imagined as a contemporary event. The Feast of the Adoration is celebrated on 6 January, and this is a chilly winter day: Mary’s dress has fur-lined sleeves; Joseph has a thick-belted robe and holds a hat; and the kings‘ retinue and bystanders are well wrapped up. Although cold, the sun seems to have been shining: the sky was originally blue, and the soldiers’ armour reflects bright light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting’s upright format and rich colouration – some colours have faded, especially the reds, pinks and purples, while the blues would have been brighter and more varied – suggest it might have been designed as an altarpiece. But the sombre atmosphere seems at odds with a devotional work, and many of the figures are almost parodied. Caspar and Melchior, on the left, are richly dressed but strangely dishevelled, with unkempt greasy hair and haggard faces; Balthasar, on the right, has a makeshift crown. The spectators seem either enraged, bewildered or asinine – the hat and profile of the man beside Joseph make an echo of the donkey behind. The threatening band of soldiers bring to mind those who would crucify Christ, while his white cloth resembles a shroud. He seems to cringe away from the kneeling Caspar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bruegel</a> seems to have worked at great speed. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> is irregular in places, perhaps because it was laid on too quickly. The priming was applied so fast that the texture of the brushstrokes is visible through the paint, as is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, which was done very quickly following a design worked out in advance. Look closely and you can see where Bruegel made small changes to the position of Balthasar’s boot and to the hand originally on the lid of Melchior’s cup. The paint itself was mostly put on very thinly, but was sometimes <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasted</a> or stippled with stiff brushes. Bruegel used brushes to both remove and apply paint, sometimes in a single stroke, and even worked the paint with his fingers. He painted his signature so rapidly that he misspelled his name and had to correct it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Other paintings allow us to understand how Bruegel composed this extraordinary image and where his ideas came from. His main inspiration was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P94-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bosch</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration of the Kings</span> (Prado, Madrid), and he also knew <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DF9-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Kings</a></span> by Gossaert – look at Caspar’s hat and sceptre and Balthasar’s spurred boot in both. The kings, stable and Virgin and Child had already appeared in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration of the Kings in a Snowstorm</span> (Oskar Reinhart Collection, Winterthur), which also has a contemporary setting and is thronged with soldiers. Our painting acted as a source for Bruegel’s sons: the dilapidated stable and some of the main figures reappear in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GK6-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Kings</a></span> by Jan Brueghel the Elder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The feeling of tension and threat sets this painting apart from the others. The crowding, the elongated proportions and small heads of the main figures and their nearness to the viewer all add to the claustrophobic atmosphere. What – if anything – this means must remain speculation: we know nothing of Bruegel’s own beliefs and aren't sure who commissioned the painting, although it was possibly Nicholas Jongelink, a collector who had several works by Bruegel of around the same date. His technique, however, is masterly: every detail is a triumph of design.</p></div>

We don't know who the sitter is, but the cut of his beard and the fashion of his hat and clothing suggest a date towards 1530, and the fact that his doublet and gown are lined with fur probably indicates that the portrait was painted during the winter months. The pose, with the sitter’s hands resting on a table placed at an angle, recurs in other, undated portraits by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gossart</a>. He might be Italian: the painting was once owned by the dukes of Mantua. But Netherlandish painting was very fashionable at the Italian courts and dukes acquired pictures from many sources.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was done at great speed with immense skill; perhaps neither sitter nor artist had much time to spare. The fur has been worked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a>, and the paint of the whites of the eyes has been feathered into the irises. Similarly, the pink paint of the cheek is feathered into the shadow cast by the nose, and the shadow cast by the fur at the collar is feathered into the white shirt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is rather small and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> is a single board of oak which was cut tangentially (across the width of the tree) rather than radially (from the outside edge in, like segments of an orange). This is unusual for Gossart’s work and in Netherlandish panels of the period, but the painting is in good condition and Gossart may have realised that, for a panel of this size, the tangential cut would not cause problems. Unpainted wood and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">barbes</span>, where the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> and paint end, survive on all four sides and indicate that the panel originally had an engaged frame that was in place before the ground was applied.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was in the collection of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Charles I</a>, whose CR brand is on the back, and it hung in the Cabinet Room off the Privy Gallery in the Palace of Westminster. It was purchased by Charles from Mantua and must have belonged to Vincenzo II Gonzaga, Duke of Mantua. Charles must have thought highly of this portrait: although he did not know who had painted it and had no particular sympathy for early Netherlandish art, he chose to place it with some of the greatest treasures of his collection. It was presumably sold from the Royal Collection during the Commonwealth but it was recovered for Charles II.</p></div>

The richness of her dress shows that she was royalty, and the blue parts of the sleeves were originally purple – a royal colour. The shape of the sleeves and the curve of the neckline suggest a date of around 1530. The only young girls in the Low Countries who might have appeared in such splendid clothes at this date were Dorothea and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CYW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christina</a>, daughters of Christian II, exiled King of Denmark. The family came to the Netherlands in 1523 when their father was deposed, and were cared for by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Margaret of Austria</a>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gossart</a> painted Dorothea with her siblings in 1526. In that picture (now in the Royal Collection, London) she has a high forehead, widely spaced eyes and frizzy hair – like the sitter here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dorothea indicates a point approximately 55° north of the equator on the outer ring of her sphere. The latitude of Copenhagen is 56° north; she may well be directing our attention to her father’s lost kingdom. Her sphere – and the world – might be upside down because of political turmoil which drove Christian and his family out of Scandinavia. These kind of visual puns and riddles were very popular in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around the broad band in the middle of the sphere is a row of letters, with vowels and consonants grouped separately. This may be an anagram of the artist’s name, although some of its letters are missing and others are included which do not appear in it. Gossart plays spatial games, too: Dorothea’s bulky sleeves and cap overlap the fictive frame. The contrast between the flat green background and the three-dimensional modelling of her figure makes her seem to project outwards towards us, as though she has escaped the confines of the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1535 Dorothea married the Count Palatine, Frederick II. Its possible that this painting was commissioned by Margaret of Austria, or one of the Habsburgs, for whom the artist often worked. Dorothea might have taken it with her to the Palatinate; a portrait of her attributed to Gossart was mentioned in an 1685 inventory of the castle of Heidelberg, hanging next to one of her husband. Heidelberg was sacked by the French in 1689, and the painting might have gone to France; French inscriptions on the back show it was in the country in about 1800.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An elderly couple stare past each other – and us – in this astonishing study of old age. Although prosperously dressed, the pair seem disappointed: their mouths are turned resolutely down, their eyes dull and their jowls sagging. The man clutches rather desperately at his fur collar and his staff, while his wife gazes vacantly into the middle distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although they overlap, each figure makes a self-contained triangle; their isolation is in vivid contrast to the classical lovers in the cameo in the man’s hat. The naked couple embrace in front of a tree; he seems to be holding a staff, she a cornucopia. They could be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a> and Fortuna, the gods of trade and prosperity, referring to the sitters' worldly success, or possibly the lovers <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a> and  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mars</a> – a bitter commentary on lost youth and passion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the woman is depicted behind the man, and although in reality her head was probably not as large his, her face is only very slightly smaller. She appears to be the younger and stronger of the two. She still has most of her teeth, while he has lost his; she is tidily dressed while he is dishevelled and poorly shaven, with fallen hairs curling around the ribbons of his hat and on his fur collar. She makes a bolder pattern of simple shapes, while his contours, as well as his body, are crumpled. He is shrinking – literally, for his body is much too small in proportion to his head. Though the two may not be communicating, she appears to buttress his shrivelled form.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The only indication of their identity is in their clothing. The man’s hat badge, which was probably created by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gossart</a>, may nevertheless suggest that he took an interest in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">classical antiquity</a>. His silver-topped staff and fur-lined gown show that he is prosperous. The cap with its two trailing ribbons is of a type found fairly frequently in North Netherlandish portraits: it was perhaps a North Netherlandish fashion to wear such hats, which might have denoted a certain status. Their clothes were in fashion in the 1510s but, given their age, they may not have kept up with the latest fashions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unusually, the painting is on parchment, perhaps to make it easier to transport. It might not have been painted for the sitters, but for some distant friend or relative. The heads were painted in different ways – the woman’s was carefully <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawn</a> and there were few changes in the final paint layer, while the man’s is more sketchy with many alterations; he may have been painted after the woman. The pair may never have seen the finished painting, may never have been aware of Gossart’s merciless observation of their agedness or the pitiful contrast between the young gods on the hat badge and their own physical state.</p></div>

We don't know who the sitter is. The only indication of his identity is his clothing, which is unusual but so similar to that of two men in portraits attributed to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Mostaert</a> (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels; Walker Art Gallery, Liverpool) that all three may have been wearing official dress of some kind. The Brussels sitter has been identified as Abel van Coulster, councillor at the Court or Council of Holland, Zeeland and West Friesland; the Liverpool and London sitters were perhaps also officials of the Council of Holland, or possibly another council.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The asymmetrical architecture behind the man was probably continued in another <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a>. At least four versions are known of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a> and Child in the style of Gossart where the background complements and completes that of this painting (Philadelphia Museum of Art; Germanisches Nationalmuseum, Nuremberg; and two in a private collection in Brussels). They are probably copies of the lost left wing of the diptych or triptych of which this painting was a part. The figures of the Virgin and Child recur, with a different background, in a painting in the Prado, Madrid, clearly by Gossart himself. It once belonged to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip II of Spain</a>, and appears not to be from a diptych but to have been designed as an independent image. It is difficult to say whether the Prado work was an adaptation by Gossart of his lost image of the Virgin, or vice versa. In either case, they were probably painted at much the same time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most art historians believe the picture was painted towards the end of Gossart’s career. The sitter’s clothes seem to include archaic as well as fashionable elements and are difficult to date, though his haircut suggests a date of around 1520.</p></div>

In his left hand he holds a book in a chemise binding, while his right is raised in blessing. On the shaft of his crosier are three crowns, which suggests that the bishop might be Saint Louis of Toulouse, who when he became Bishop of Toulouse renounced the three kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and Jerusalem all previously held by his father. The saint was usually shown as a youth, but the artist who painted this picture may not have known much about him – he was not particularly celebrated or represented in the Low Countries.

They were probably painted in around 1540 after his return from Italy, as is clear from the antique drapery, jewellery and hairstyle of Mary Magdalene and her ’Grecian‘ profile. Van Heemskerck arrived in Rome in 1532, and both classical and contemporary Italian art had an enormous influence on his later work. After his return to Haarlem he received important commissions from both Haarlem and other Dutch cities, including an enormous <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a> of the Passion (now in Linköping Cathedral), a Crucifixion scene (Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent) and a triptych with an ’Ecce Homo' in 1544 (National Museum, Warsaw).

Two keys hang from a cord on his left wrist. There appear to be two standing figures on his morse (the clasp on his cope) but the detail is difficult to make out. A veil is tied to his crosier.

He was, however, normally shown bearded and wearing a grander papal tiara. The only other male saint depicted holding two keys seems to have been the seventh-century Saint Riquier, but he was an abbot, not a bishop. Saint Servatius was a bishop, and while one of his emblems was a key – he was patron of locksmiths – he was shown with only one, and was often accompanied by a dragon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin must have looked as if she was kneeling on the original frame, as did the donor in the other panel. The current frames are old, but not original. They bear the marks of hinges, which were almost certainly in place when the wings were still fixed to the lost central panel, but their carpentry is rather crude: before treatment in 1986–7 neither panel fitted well into its frame. The unpainted edges show that the original frames were engaged (made from the same piece of wood as the panel) and were secured with pegs that fitted into holes in the unpainted edges. It remains to be discovered why the original frames were removed and replaced, apparently when the panels still formed part of a triptych.</p></div>

She signed this portrait in Latin in the top right corner: CATHARINA DE/HEMESSEN PINGEBAT/1551 (‘Catharine de Hemessen was painting [this] 1551’), when she was only 23 years old.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We do not know who the sitter was, but she was evidently wealthy. Her fine shirt, visible at her neck and wrists, is ornamented with delicate black embroidery, and only loosely tied across her neck; the bodice of her dress is corded and watered silk. Her sleeves are of red velvet, her skirt made of black damask. She holds a pair of gloves, presumably leather, decorated with black and golden embroidery. Her belt is made of black beads and cylinders, held in place with gold settings. It may likely carry a pomander (a round vessel, usually a fine piece of gilded metalwork, containing perfume) at its end. A small dog with what seem to be bells on its collar is tucked under her arm. Portraits of affluent women with pet animals were quite common in the sixteenth century; both <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P30-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bronzino</a> at the Medici court in Florence (The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and the Netherlandish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonis Mor</a> at the Imperial court in Madrid (Museo Nacional del Prado, Madrid) have portrayed their female sitters with their lapdogs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is in good condition. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> is one board of oak which has been slightly trimmed on the right and at the bottom, but very little has been lost. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> is chalk; over that is a thin, pale salmon-pink priming of lead white <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> mixed with some red lead.

The dog’s head has a reserve, but the complex position of its body held delicately under the sitter’s arm and its paws were only defined in the painting process. The bluish whites of the woman’s eyes are painted over a pink basic flesh colour. The reds in the flesh are mostly red lake; some areas of vermilion may be old retouching, but some are clearly original, like the sitter’s lower lip and the dog’s ear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Only eight portraits and very few devotional paintings signed by Catharina survive in public collections around the world, with several attributed works in public and private collections in need of further study.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Trained in the workshop of her father, the prolific Antwerp painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Sanders van Hemessen</a>, Catharina produced refined small-scale portraits and religious scenes. Her sitters’ bearings and attire conform to official portrait types popular at the Habsburg court. The small format turns them into intimate marvels that showcase the painter’s skill. Her pictures were sought after by collectors at the time much like those of her female Italian contemporaries. The Florentine writer Ludovico Guicciardini, who had lived several years in the Netherlands, praised her as one of only four women artists from Antwerp in his description of the Low Countries (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Descrittione di tutti i Paesi Bassi</span>, 1567). He does not fail to mention that she and her husband, a famed organist, followed Mary of Hungary to Spain, where they stayed until the queen’s death in 1558 before returning to the Netherlands.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The German-born painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PSX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Holbein the Younger</a> made this portrait during his first visit to England from 1526 to 1528. In this time he developed his reputation as a portraitist, becoming the most sought-after painter in the country. This enigmatic painting expresses the desire and ambition of Holbein’s patrons as well as showing off his skill in creating striking compositions and emulating a range of textures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A solemn woman in a white cap made of dense fur sits with a red squirrel in her lap and a glossy-feathered starling at her shoulder. The half-length view, typical of Holbein’s portraits of English sitters, creates an intimate image which focuses on the woman’s facial features and the details of her clothing. Her outfit is simple but made up from a variety of different materials, each of which Holbein has observed carefully. The fine white linen chemise is almost transparent in contrast to the thicker folded shawl; its edges are defined by thin wavy black lines, something Holbein did to emphasise the crispness of a fabric (he often used this method in frilled cuffs, for example, as in his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CYW-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait of Christina of Denmark</a>). The white fabrics appear grey in shadow, giving a sense of three-dimensionality which emphasises the geometry of the fur cap and the curve of the shawl around the sitter’s shoulders. This prominent shadow and the three-quarter turn of the sitter’s torso also separate her from the plain background, its intense colour contrasting with her monochrome clothing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in all of Holbein’s portraits, the sitter’s facial features and figure are made up of decisive contours, a graphic style which mirrors that of his numerous preparatory portrait sketches (the majority of which are in the Royal Collection). The use of strong lines and colours created striking and memorable images, while the accuracy of drawing and close observation of textures and materials gave a lifelikeness never seen before. The portrait follows a formula that Holbein was using at the time: there is little space around the sitter’s head and body, she faces to the right at a three-quarter angle, her right arm runs almost parallel with the lower edge of the picture and her hands are positioned at the very corner of the picture. The blue background, which is here made up of azurite (a natural mineral <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>) mixed with white, was also a common feature of his paintings. It was used by other German painters at this time too – see, for example, Hans Baldung Grien’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Holbein’s process for creating portraits involved making a drawing of the sitter from life and transferring it onto <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> before beginning to paint. He would put a piece of paper covered in charcoal face down onto the panel, then place the drawing over the top. By applying pressure to the outlines of the drawing, its contours would be transferred in charcoal onto the panel. Holbein would then use these charcoal lines as a guide, painting over them in order to create the image. Occasionally he diverted from the drawn design, but in this case he seems only to have changed the position of the structured fur cap and altered the hairline slightly. The drawings from life usually included just the sitter’s head and shoulders; hands were most probably added later, and were not necessarily drawn from the sitter. Those in this portrait, for example, are not particularly feminine – Holbein might have formulated them from different drawings of hands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is in excellent condition, making it easy to admire Holbein’s technique for painting the array of textures – the softness of the fur cap, the cool metal links of the squirrel’s chain, which falls loosely through the woman’s fingers, and the silky plumage of the bird at her shoulder. He has achieved these effects through his expert understanding and control of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> paint, using a range of different techniques. For example, the folded edges of the white shawl were created by indenting the paint using the wooden end of a paintbrush and partially filling the depressions with fine lines of black paint. The Russian ermine fur cap is made of a series of small pelts sewn together; Holbein has described the joins by applying layers of wet paint in various shades of grey-brown.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The animals were probably added at a late stage, after the woman was painted. X-ray photographs of the picture show a belt, which was covered when Holbein decided to change the position of the woman’s arm, possibly because he thought a higher position would make a more appropriate perch for the squirrel. Nonetheless, the squirrel and the starling are key elements of the picture. Common pets in the fifteenth-century, these animals also have a symbolic meaning and serve as the clues to the sitter’s identity. She is thought to be Anne Lovell, a wealthy and well-connected woman whose husband, Sir Francis Lovell, held the title of ‘esquire of the body’ (a personal attendant) to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SW8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Henry VIII</a>, King of England. In 1526, Francis became sheriff of Norfolk.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was most probably commissioned to commemorate a series of important moments in the lives of the couple. Sir Francis inherited an estate at East Harling from his uncle, Sir Thomas Lovell, in 1524. The starling is probably intended as a rhyming pun of East Harling, while squirrels nibbling on nuts, like this one is, feature on the heraldry of the Lovell family. The windows of the church at East Harling include two of the family’s coats of arms in stained glass, each showing six red squirrels; the animal also appears on the Lovell family tombs in the church. The portrait, by the most sought-after portraitist in the country and with its references to the family’s name and estate, underlined Francis’s new status as wealthy landowner. A more specific reason for the commission may be to commemorate the birth of a son, named Thomas, to the couple in the spring of 1526. It has been suggested that the squirrel stands in for the infant, who would carry the family name and inherit the Norfolk estate.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An unknown man gazes past us into the distance. There is nothing to identify him beyond the scroll in his hand, which tells us his age: 38. His clothing is sombre but does suggest that he was a man of means. His fine white shirt has a decorated collar and he wears a grey doublet with a damask-like pattern under a robe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man’s costume and the style of the painting suggest it was created in around 1520. The painting isn‘t signed but it resembles a group of portrait drawings made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lucas van Leyden</a>, two of which are dated 1521. The drawings are thought to have been influenced by the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>, whom van Leyden met in Antwerp that year. But this painting is less close to Dürer’s work, so it was not necessarily made after the two met.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter was once identified as van Leyden himself, but seems more likely to have been an ancestor of a later owner, Claes Adriansz. van Leeuwen, possibly his maternal grandfather, the lawyer Franz van Leeuwen. It might have been painted shortly before his death in the winter of 1519–20.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In sixteenth-century portraits across Europe, sitters often hold objects which give some clue as to their identity or profession, as in Moroni’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F9F-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Tailor (’Il Tagliapanni')</a></span>, or their character and concerns, as in van Scorel’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DB5-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Man with Pansies and a Skull</a></span>. Here we have nothing to go on but the face itself. The man’s intent gaze, firm jaw and determined mouth give an impression of a formidable character. The simplicity of the composition and his dress perhaps tells us more about who he <span class="dokuwiki_italic">was not</span> than who he <span class="dokuwiki_italic">was</span>. There is no conspicuous display of wealth and status, none of the trappings of scholarship, neither arms nor armour; he was presumably not an aristocrat, soldier, scholar or cleric, but a prosperous professional. This intensity and edginess is typical of van Leyden and can also be found in other Netherlandish portraits.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This sitter is shown in three-quarter profile strongly lit from the left, a typical pose for Netherlandish portraits. The light on his face and hands contrasts strongly with his dark clothing and the deep shadow down his right cheek and jaw, in a way that recalls Jan van Eyck’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D41-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man (Self Portrait?)</a></span> of almost 100 years earlier. Space seems compressed: the man’s shoulders fill the width of the painting and his hands seem to be cut by the frame (although the panel may have been cut down). The way his shadow falls on the green background suggests that it is just behind him. This is a painting meant to be seen close up: details such as the strands of hair curling from under the hat, the fine line of his mouth and the tiny lights in his eyes all demand careful attention.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The green background has red underpainting, a peculiarity found in other portraits by van Leyden. We are not sure why he did this; perhaps the red slightly muted the bright copper green <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two strikingly ugly men in extraordinary clothing are seated at a table in a panelled interior. One writes in a ledger, the other – his features contorted into a sneer – grasps at a pile of coins. Documents, some of them legible, are piled on a cupboard behind the pair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marinus van Reymerswale</a> and his workshop produced a number of versions of this very successful composition. Many include manuscripts and legal documents that contain references to the town and inhabitants of Reymerswale, where Marinus probably spent much of his life (the town disappeared beneath the waters of the Ooster Schelde in the seventeenth century). Here, the ledger in which the man is writing contains an account of the town’s income over seven months, while on the shelf above his head is a deed issued in 1515 by two Reymerswale aldermen, including one Cornelis Danielsz. Other documents reference the Voxen family, whose members held various offices in the town in the first half of the sixteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The clothing would have looked old-fashioned to contemporary viewers: the red (now faded to pink) heart-shaped hat looks like those worn by stylish women in the mid-fifteenth century, and both hats are ‘dagged’ – or cut in the style of the early fifteenth century. The man on the left is a municipal official; in another version his ring is ornamented with the coat of arms of Reymerswale. These men might even have been recognisable caricatures of real people, possibly members of the Voxen family or associates of Danielsz., himself known for corrupt practices. His brother-in-law, Dirck Jansz., had bribed his way into his position as Burgomaster in 1516, and was a colleague of one Adriaen Adriaensz. Voxen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is a careful copy of a picture now in the Louvre, Paris. Simplified versions of the composition exist at Antwerp and Warsaw. The Paris painting is clearly the original – its <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> was done freehand, whereas that in our painting was traced. Our picture is not by the same artist as the Paris one: the technique is very different and, in some respects, more sophisticated. The artist of the National Gallery painting was better at transitions of tone and hue in the draperies, but less successful at highlights: the teeth and fingernails have an unnatural gleam. It may have been done by someone working in Marinus’s workshop, though not trained by him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The number of versions indicate just how successful a scene this was, with variants showing a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Banker and his Wife</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Two Misers</span>. All are satires of greed and corruption. Tax collectors were paid percentages of the revenues they collected, and had many incentives to extort every last mite from the tax-payers. The two men, hideous in spite of their rich clothes, are vilified for their bureaucratic and legalistic greed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The same objects and documents appear in different versions, which continued to be produced during the ten or fifteen years after Marinus’s disappearance in 1545. The artists seem to have had access to Marinus’s pattern drawings and other reference material. They would have found such things in his workshop, or perhaps with his successors if they had continued to run his business after his death. The simplified versions are difficult to date, and some have inscriptions in French rather than Dutch. Marinus’s heirs may have been supplying an international market, or perhaps one or two of them moved south into the French-speaking areas of the Low Countries. The texts in the ledgers also change from version to version, and were perhaps open to different interpretations, though all were meant as attacks on avarice.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This must be one of the most arresting faces in the National Gallery’s Collection. An elderly woman with lively eyes set deep in their sockets, a snub nose, wide nostrils, pimply skin, a hairy mole, bulging forehead and a prominent square chin and rests one hand on a marble parapet. Her neck is rumpled by age and she seems to have lost all her teeth. She challenges every traditional canon of beauty. This striking work captures the emergence of the grotesque (in the original sense of the word, denoting the surprising, unusual, and playful) as a subject for painting. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PXN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Quinten Massys</a> pioneered this type of secular, satirical imagery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The woman’s clothes are rich. Defying the modesty expected from older women during the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a>, she is wearing a low-cut, uncovered, and tightly laced bodice that emphasises her wrinkly cleavage. Her hair is concealed in the horns of a heart-shaped bonnet, over which she has placed a white veil, secured by a large, bejewelled brooch. However fine her attire, by the time this panel was painted in the early sixteenth century her clothes would have been many decades out of date, prompting laughter rather than admiration. Her headdress had by then become an iconographic shorthand for female vanity, its horns compared to those of the devil.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is part of a pair: her ‘other half’, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Old Man</span> also painted by Massys, is in a private collection in New York. The old woman dons this flamboyant and provocative outfit in order to seduce the old man, to whom she offers a rosebud, a flower with sexual connotations. She breaks conventions by appearing on the proper right, the more prestigious side reserved for men in double portraits. Viewers were invited to mock the foolishness of the old who behave as if they are still young.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There has been speculation that the artist depicted a woman with Paget’s disease – a rare illness causing bone hypertrophy. Yet rather than painted from life, this figure was more probably a fictional, folkloric character from the world of carnival: the figure of the lavishly dressed old woman with a horned headdress recurs in several <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">prints</a>, miniatures, and misericords (the carved reliefs that adorned the underside of folding seats in choir stalls) of the period. In presenting such figures of fun as elaborate portraits, Massys parodied the dignified genre.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Massys shared his interest in the expressive power of the human face with his contemporary, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, who made countless studies of grotesque heads, many of which feature old women in similar attire. Two drawings of an old woman by followers of the artist show the same unforgettable face (Royal Library, Windsor Castle and New York Public Library). Massys probably took inspiration from Leonardo’s composition, as he did on other occasions. Yet he adeptly transformed the small drawing into an ambitious life-size painting, giving it a pendant and fleshing out its satirical content.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Technical analysis</a> confirms that the painting is an original, not a copy. infrared reflectograms have revealed a good deal of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>. That for the face is carefully done, whereas that for the clothes and other elements is freer and sketchier. For the face, the artist may have carefully followed a preliminary drawing but made several changes. The eyes were drawn twice – they were moved slightly up and to the right – and the painted chin, neck and right ear are smaller than in the underdrawing. Her right shoulder was also redrawn in its present painted place and both hands are differently posed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Several idiosyncrasies of the painting technique support attribution to Massys himself. The paint is worked in many places <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> and has been dragged and feathered. In many places energetic feathering has been used to soften transitions of tone, a technique which seems to have been peculiarly Quinten’s. Some of the hair near the Duchess’ right ear and some of the embroidery on her right cuff are rendered in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffito</span>, where the artist has scratched through a layer of still-wet paint to reveal what is underneath. The mottled areas of her flesh were achieved by spotting the basic pink with red and white dots, dashes and blotches. The skill of the brushwork is clear if you look very closely at the filigree of the brooch, where at least five shades of brown, orange, pink and yellow are found, and where a paint containing mainly lead-tin yellow is fairly heavily impastoed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two horns of the headdress were rendered by different methods. On the right, the horn’s stripes have been made by removing the red, white and blue to reveal the black layer underneath; on the left, black paint has been applied on top. They may have been done by different assistants, or perhaps Massys discovered another way of executing the patterns which he preferred to the first.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the seventeenth century, the painting was misidentified as a portrait of Margaret Maultasch, Duchess of Carinthia and Countess of Tyrol, a historical figure who had been defamed by her enemies as the ‘ugliest woman in history’. On this basis, she later gained the nickname ‘The Ugly Duchess’. In the Victorian era, this picture (or one of its many versions) inspired John Tenniel’s depiction of the Duchess in his illustrations of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lewis Carroll’s Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland</span> (1865). This entrenched the moniker and turned this figure into an icon for generations of readers.</p></div>

According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, Catherine was a fourth-century princess who converted to Christianity; here, she is dressed as a princess, with a sliver-grey fur bodice, a necklace of enormous pearls and more pearls in her headdress. When pressed to choose a husband, she stated that she had given herself to Christ and was rewarded with a vision in which Christ placed a wedding ring on her finger and declared her to be his spouse. She was later executed by the Roman emperor; the wheel on which she was tortured leans against a column behind her and she rests her left hand on the sword of her <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin and Saint Barbara hold a red circlet decorated with pearls in a zigzag pattern. Barbara was a lady of high rank, and was imprisoned in a tower – visible just behind her head here – as a punishment for becoming a Christian. She was often paired with Saint Catherine in the art of the Low Countries around 1500.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the rare surviving examples of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> painting done on cloth rather than a wooden <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> (another is <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D6L-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Entombment</a></span> by Dirk Bouts). Although many such paintings were made, they were extremely fragile; this one has several tears and the paint is worn, exposing the canvas in some places. The support is linen and while there is no conventional <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, the fabric was probably coated with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EBA-0008-0000-0000.htm">glue size</a> made from animal skin. Cloth paintings were sometimes originally stretched over wooden boards rather than nailed to a frame, and the holes in this piece of linen could have been made by woodworm from such a backing panel. There are traces of a black painted border.</p></div>
