He has picked a number of features typical of the local forest, placing them all within one image: the small stream that runs beneath the bridge, a fortified building and a rocky crag.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Altdorfer has composed the scene from a low viewpoint, which emphasises the height of the wooden footbridge that leads to the gatehouse of a castle. It is the anchor of the scene, joining the building on the left to the wilderness on the right, connecting civilisation with nature. The true subject of the picture, however, is the detailed study of the enormous larch tree at the centre, its branches growing wildly in all directions and the weight of the foliage causing the upper branches to droop. The forest encroaches the bridge on all sides, and clusters of tree trunks mirror its tall supporting posts, contrasting the living wood with the dead. The man-made structures seem frail by comparison to the vast and vital nature all around. Framed by the bridge’s stilt-like supports is a small village, the spire of its church reaching up above the tree tops, minuscule in the shadow of the huge rocky mountain in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted with oil paint on parchment stuck on to a wooden panel, this is one of two paintings by Altdorfer of landscapes with no figures (the other is in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich). His interest in the poetry and drama of his local surroundings reflected the development of landscape painting as a subject in its own right at the beginning of the sixteenth century.</p></div>

This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, translator of the Bible into Latin. His only companion is an endearing lion which lies peaceably in the corner – he had tamed it by removing a thorn from its paw.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome was a favourite of the religious orders as a role model for living an ascetic life – he renounced worldly riches and pleasure – and also of humanist scholars for his study of the Bible. He was widely depicted in northern Italian art, from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pisanello</a> on. Sometimes he kneels in penitence for his sins, as in Cima da Conegliano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D1W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in a Landscape</a></span>; sometimes he is in the act of translation, as in Antonello’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in his Study</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> painted this subject several times during his career. He was catering for the Venetian art market, and devotional panels which shared some of the qualities of early Netherlandish paintings were especially valued; Bellini developed a genre of religious paintings which took their meaning from the use of landscape and light. In all his images of Saint Jerome, the setting seems as much the subject as the saint. Cliffs tower around him and exemplify his isolation in the wilderness, cut off by rocks and water from civilisation, represented by the walled city behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure of the saint and parts of the rocky outcrop appear in a much larger painting, probably a small altarpiece (Uffizi, Florence). As they are very different in scale, the design can't have been transferred mechanically from one to the other. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has shown that Bellini made his usual highly detailed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawings</a>. The only pentimento in this carefully planned painting is the lion tucked into the lower right corner over the complete rocks; it adds a lively, humorous touch. It was not drawn from life, but is probably derived from many such beasts in the notebooks of his father, Jacopo Bellini.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is carefully and geometrically structured. The saint’s body, from his bent and brightly lit right arm to his feet, forms a curve around the book balanced on his knee, cutting him off from the landscape and emphasising his absorption in the text. The diagonal line of his upper arm and shoulder are echoed by the rocky outcrop behind him, which itself pushes the city further into the distance. The line of his right arm is continued by the city walls and the top of the cliff, and other diagonals are formed by the book and the fissures in the cliff face. The movement from lower left to upper right is brought to an abrupt halt by the barren tree which juts out in the opposite direction, echoing the line of the saint’s left leg. A bright light, shining from the left, falls on Saint Jerome, his book and the foreground cliffs, and on the towers of the distant city; the landscape between them is plunged in shadow.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Recent technical study has confirmed that the painting is by Bellini. Saint Jerome’s head is depicted with great attention to detail, the paint applied quickly and loosely using a fine-pointed brush: look closely and you can see the brushstrokes in Jerome’s hair and beard. The illusionistic detail of the distant roofs and towers, which have also been rapidly painted, can be seen in Bellini’s other works, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFR-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Agony in the Garden</a></span>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An old man with a long white beard kneels in a rocky landscape. This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, one of the four Doctors of the Church. After a dissolute youth, the saint converted to Christianity and spent time as a hermit in the Syrian desert. He later used his classical learning to produce the Latin Vulgate, the standard version of the Bible. He was inspiration both for Christian penitents and for humanist scholars; to scholars, he was a model for the study of classical texts and for the solitary life, away from the distractions of the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A large number of small-scale paintings of Saint Jerome were produced in the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, combining his roles as hermit and scholar: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D27-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in a Landscape</a></span> by Bono da Ferrara, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D4D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome reading in a Landscape</a></span> by Giovanni Bellini and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a></span> by Albrecht Dürer. In these, as in this painting, he is accompanied by the faithful lion from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DAV-0001-0000-0000.htm">whose paw he had pulled a thorn</a>. Here, however, the saint is not reading. He has flung himself to the ground in a penitential frenzy, gazing in awe at a fragile cross made from two slender branches roped together. His fingers are clenched around the stone which he used to beat his breast when tempted by sinful thoughts (here symbolised by the snake wriggling on the ground).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of a series of versions of the subject painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cima da Conegliano</a>, allowing us to see how his idea of the subject developed (others are in the Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan; the National Gallery of Art, Washington; and the Uffizi, Florence). All seem to derive from a large and beautiful painting at Harewood House, Leeds, which was in turn Cima’s response to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>’s large panel of about 1480, now in the Uffizi, Florence. In our painting, Cima has selected and rearranged elements of both the Harewood painting and Bellini’s versions: the hawk on the bare branch, the overhanging rock, the enclosing walls of the craggy hollow rendered claustrophobic by the small scale of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint’s dramatic pose is a reversed and exaggerated version of the Harewood figure, his body tipped forward to increase the painting’s emotional intensity. The composition is carefully arranged to focus our attention on the white of the stone Jerome holds, almost in the centre. The shapes of the landscape are closely related to Jerome’s own shape and movements, and the picture is structured around a series of diagonal parallel lines running from top left to bottom right. The slope of the rocky hill on the left is extended by the curving road and bridge, and by the foliage of the bush between the saint and the cross. The line of the saint’s right arm continues up through the slopes of the distant mountains and down along his leg. It is echoed by the leaning tree and stark bare branch, the line of which continues that of the saint’s left arm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The fertile plain and sunlit city on the hill of Bellini’s paintings and Cima’s Harewood version have receded into the distance, leaving the saint alone in the wilderness, cut off by the wall of rock behind him. Figures pass unaware on the road behind him, emphasising his isolation from civilisation.</p></div>

The two foreground figures are genuine and may represent Saint Roch and Gothardus, who tended the plague sore on Saint Roch’s thigh. If this is the case, the picture might have been painted to commemorate relief from the plague in the Veneto in 1504. The sinister little beaked creature emerging from the water also seems to be genuine, although its meaning is unclear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After its rediscovery in the 1930s, the painting underwent several phases of restoration. Saint George and the dragon were added to cover a large area of damage, as was the monster in the lake, and the  ‘hermit’ in the cave on the right was extensively repainted. However, the distant landscape with its atmospheric dissolution of light is evidence of Giorgione’s work.</p></div>

The two foreground figures are genuine and they may represent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Roch</a> and his attendant Gothardus, who tended the plague sore on Saint Roch’s thigh. If this is the case, the picture may have been painted to commemorate relief from the plague, against which Saint Roch was invoked in the Veneto in 1504. The sinister little beaked creature or devil emerging from the water also seems to be genuine, although its meaning is unclear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The other figures are more puzzling. The ‘hermit’ in the cave on the far right is extensively repainted, but his head and arms could be based on original fragments. The Saint George on a rearing horse attacking a dragon is a later addition to cover a large area of damage, as is the monster in the centre of the lake. What now appears as the dragon’s tail is original paint, but might have begun life as tree roots.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After its rediscovery in a villa not far from Venice in the 1930s, this painting underwent several phases of restoration. It had suffered substantial damage and loss of paint in the trees on the left, in the very centre of the canvas and in the rocks at the upper right. Lower down on the right there was a hole through the canvas, surrounded by considerable flaking and overpaint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was sent to a restorer called Augusto Vermehren, who also worked for the Uffizi in Florence. He cleaned and lined the canvas before filling the losses with putty and retouching. Shortly after this, the picture was bought by a young Russian art dealer called Vitale Bloch, who, having obtained a licence to export the work from Italy, sent it to Theodor Dumler in Rome to be restored again in 1934. Subsequently, the mounted figure of Saint George appeared in the area of the large loss on the right, as well as three rocks in the water. The restorer constructed Saint George using patches of old painted canvas, suggesting that he and the dealer were hoping to conceal the extent of damage to the painting from a future purchaser.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After restoration, the painting was moved to a London bank vault, where it remained unseen until the important Giorgione exhibition in Venice in 1955. Following the exhibition, the National Gallery decided to buy the painting and it was eventually purchased in 1961. The Gallery’s restorer, Arthur Lucas, removed the three rocks in the centre of the pool, but replaced them with the monster – perhaps when he realised the extent of the damage in this area.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although various parts of the picture that we see today are not original, the distant landscape with its atmospheric dissolution of light is evidence of Giorgione’s work.</p></div>

Behind them, the river broadens into an estuary where seagoing ships are sailing. In the ship on the left, two sailors are furling the top sail on the foremast; on the right is a rowing boat. In the foreground, the man on the right with a staff and long grey beard must be the hermit who instructed Saint Christopher in the Christian faith. There are shells on the beach at his feet and the building with a bell on its roof behind him, might be his hermitage.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small picture shows two episodes from the life of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>. At the front, the saint sits under a lean-to shelter, built against a natural rock arch in a dramatic landscape, and removes a large thorn from a lion’s paw. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, Saint Jerome met and healed an injured lion which then remained with him in the wilderness and after his return to monastic life. They are depicted together in the wilderness in Bellini’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D4D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome reading in a Landscape</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arch leads to another rock, topped with buildings that are accessible only by a track of planks supported on posts; a man and his dog make their way up it. This is the monastery near Bethlehem where Jerome lived (the red objects hanging from the church tower could be nesting boxes for birds). On the grassy platform in front of the monastery a man dressed as a cardinal addresses two merchants. Their camels carry barrels, probably containing oil, and large greyish packs; a donkey grazes behind them. This figure is also Saint Jerome – he was often shown as a cardinal as he had been secretary to the pope. The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span> tells how the lion guarded the donkey that carried firewood for the monastery, and when passing merchants stole the animal the lion recovered it. The merchants came to the monastery to ask Jerome’s forgiveness and gave him oil.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture has been cut down on the right; the strip of wood along the edge was created by scraping away the paint and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> to match the other unpainted edges. It originally looked very like a version of the subject in the Von der Heydt Museum, Wuppertal, which includes other incidents from the story. There are variants of the scene in the Prado, Madrid, in the Louvre, Paris and elsewhere, some closer to our painting than others. It seems impossible to work out the exact stages by which the composition evolved. The Prado painting is signed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Joachim Patinir</a> and it’s possible that all of them were being worked on at much the same time in his workshop, probably before 1518. Ideas tried out in one painting were sometimes taken up in another or others.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This brutal fight between the Lapiths and the centaurs, as described by the first-century Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a> in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, is displayed on this panel. The story starts with the wedding feast of Pirithous, King of the Lapiths. During the celebrations, the centaur Eurytion, drunk and possessed by lust, seized the bride by her hair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero di Cosimo</a> has actually relegated this scene to the right, showing the bride partially naked in a blue robe with Eurytion grabbing her hair; Theseus, founder and king of Athens, hurls a decorated vessel at him. All the commotion seems superfluous to the centaur couple embracing in the middle of the composition: this is Hylonome, who kisses her lover Cyllarus as he dies from a javelin wound. These figures are secondary in Ovid’s story but Piero di Cosimo has centred them, capturing a tender moment amid the violence. The artist’s decision to divide the scene into scattered groupings of figures contradicted contemporary art treatises that emphasised the importance of a unified composition – in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Battle of the Centaurs</span> (Casa Buonarroti, Florence), for example, the action is focused in the middle of the picture. In contrast, Piero has focused on the tragic love story of the two centaurs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The background figures are also directly based on Ovid’s tale. On the right, centaurs use a burning shrine, the leg of a table, the antlers of a stag and a chandelier from a nearby sanctuary as weapons. The brawl in the middle, unfolding on the rug where guests were feasting, is a blur of fighting figures. Slightly to the left is the centaur who, according to Ovid, slipped while running and fell on an ash tree, where he was crushed by a rock thrown by a Lapith. Finally, on the far left is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Hercules</a> with his laurel wreath and lion skin, about to attack a white centaur.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was made as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E7B-0008-0000-0000.htm">spalliera</a></span>, which would be set into the panelling of a wealthy man’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">camera</span> (chamber) in his family palace. It was probably commissioned at the time of the man’s marriage. The story of the Lapiths and centaurs was chosen as a lesson to the husband and wife on how not to behave. The people who commissioned this work were probably familiar with the tale – the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> had been translated into Italian, and it was not only known by those who had a classical education.

Another is <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D6B-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Vision of Saint Eustace</a></span>. Here, very curiously, his signature, ‘Pisanus p[inxi]t’ (‘Pisano painted [this]’) is in the form of curling fronds of greenery with small blue flowers at the corners – right in the middle, at the bottom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don‘t know who this painting was made for, though Pisanello was a court painter and worked for various Italian noble families. It was always a single panel and its small scale suggests it was for private enjoyment. The iconography is unusual and must have had a particular meaning for the original commissioner. In some ways it resembles manuscript illuminations made for French aristocracy: the Virgin and Child shown in a sunburst comes from the medieval Apocalypse, the illustrated Book of Revelations, in which a woman clothed in the sun gives birth to a child to rule all nations. Saints George and Anthony were very widely venerated in northern Italy and they were often shown together, although rarely alone like this. Saint Anthony was a hermit, while Saint George was regarded as a patron of the medieval knightly class. Perhaps they represent two different ways of life, the ascetic – that is, renouncing worldly riches and pleasure – and the courtly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pisanello was especially famous in his lifetime for his images of animals. No preparatory drawings for this panel survive, but similar boars and dragons are found in drawings attributed to him (now in the Louvre, Paris and the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). He often reused details from drawings and model books, making it hard to date this panel. The horses’ heads are especially close to drawings Pisanello made for frescoes in Saint‘Anastasia in Verona around 1434–8. The panel was probably painted shortly after that.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was not in good condition when it was bought in 1862 by Sir Charles Eastlake, the National Gallery’s first director, and was extensively restored for him. Very little of the surface of the upper part of the painting is original, but the restoration seems to have been reasonably faithful. In places we can see the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> through the restored layers, as in the faces of the Virgin and Child. An elaborate gilded frame was made for Eastlake and contains copies of medals with portraits of Pisanello and Leonello d’<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Este</a>, once thought to be a model for Saint George.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are looking at a miraculous event. An elegantly dressed huntsman has been stopped in this tracks by an apparition: a large stag with a Crucifix between its antlers. This is Saint Eustace, whose story was told in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span>, the famous medieval collection of saints‘ lives. A Roman soldier named Placidus was out hunting when he had a vision of a stag with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> on a shining cross between its antlers. He converted to Christianity at once and changed his name to Eustace.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He doesn’t look like a Roman soldier here, though. Instead <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pisanello</a> has depicted an Italian prince, in a fantastic blue hat, out hunting with his hounds. We do not know who this painting was for, but its small size suggests it was for the private enjoyment of an aristocrat. Although he was rarely shown in Italian art, Saint Eustace personified the ideals of the medieval knightly class, for whom hunting was not just a hobby but an enormously important activity. It was seen both as a metaphor for the soul’s search for God and as a virtuous activity which kept men busy – and therefore out of temptation’s way. Most importantly it was the primary training for war, which was aristocracy’s most important function.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pisanello was especially famous for his ability to show animals. The huge number of his surviving drawings include various studies for the creatures in this painting, some taken from model books, some taken from earlier artists and some from live and dead animals. This painting is full not just of various dogs – some seemingly taken from the lavishly illustrated hunting treatises which were very popular in the fifteenth century – but also birds, a hare and even a bear; all are amazingly lifelike. He paid meticulous attention to detail, comparable to that of contemporary Netherlandish artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a>. Look closely and you can see the spiked wheels on the saint’s long rowel spurs and the way the horse’s shoes turn up at the ends to give extra grip on wet ground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One very strange feature is the blank scroll at the front. There is no sign it ever had any text and its meaning remains mysterious, though a similarly placed scroll on <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D27-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome in a Landscape</a></span> by Pisanello’s pupil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P8M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bono da Ferrara</a> contains the artist’s signature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sadly this painting has suffered considerably from deliberate damage, from changes in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">glossary:pigments</a> and from restoration. It was once taller and had a less claustrophobic feel: a later copy in the Cini Collection, Venice, shows a landscape with hills and sky at the top. Many of the colours have darkened, obscuring details, and the surface is worn down and has been extensively retouched. The saint’s clothes and many of the animals have been repainted – like the horse, which was originally whitish-grey but has been darkened by retouching. But you can get a sense of the painting’s original quality from the flowers and foliage around horse, which are still in good condition.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This tiny picture combines the beauty of nature and of man – quite literally in the case of Daphne, who is shown being transformed into a leafy laurel tree. It has grand themes: the rivalry of the gods, the power and danger of desire and the tragedy of unrequited love.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story comes from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> by Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>, a rich source of myths based around the subject of transformation, and hugely popular with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> artists and patrons. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, taking revenge on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E91-0008-0000-0000.htm">Apollo</a> for his teasing, struck the god with a golden arrow, igniting a fierce desire for Daphne. He struck Daphne with a lead-tipped arrow which made Apollo disgusting to her, despite his fame as the attractive young god of the sun. When he began to pursue her she fled across the hillside; pitying her, Peneus, her father and a river god, helped her to escape Apollo’s embrace by transforming her into a laurel tree.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Apollo’s speedy pursuit is brought to an abrupt halt as Daphne’s left leg becomes rooted to the ground – it is now a trunk, supporting the weight of the lush branches that have replaced her arms. He embraces her tightly around the waist, catching a last glimpse of her before he has even been able to stop running – his right leg and white drapery trail behind him. Daphne too has been frozen mid-stride. The slit in her dress reveals her shapely leg, suggestively intertwined, if only briefly, with his.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ovid recounts how Apollo, somewhat pathetically, vowed to love her, even as a tree: ‘My hair, my lyre, my quiver shall always be entwined with thee, O laurel.’  Daphne is the ultimate example of unattainable love, celebrated in poetry by the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch. His sonnets praising his beloved Laura, whose name is derived from laurel, were hugely popular among the Florentine elite. His love for Laura, who remained forever beyond his reach, became the ideal form of love in courtly circles, allowing young men to nobly strive for an ideal beauty beyond their reach. Apollo here is cast as the aristocratic youth in his elegant hunting outfit, woven with gold thread and encrusted with jewels.  His quiver (the case for his arrows) hangs at his left side. Daphne is the ideal Petrarchan Renaissance beauty: fair-skinned, blonde and seemingly modest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pollaiuolo</a> has set the myth in the Florentine countryside: in the background is the valley of the river Arno that runs through Florence – the distant city must be Florence itself. Miniature details, such as the hunt taking place just in front of the river, reflect courtly pastimes that would have appealed to the patrons but also echoed the story itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Once thought to be a side panel from a Renaissance <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0END-0008-0000-0000.htm">cassone</a></span>, the picture was probably made as an independent painting. The  delicacy of the minute details, like the flowers scattered across the hillside and the reflection of the trees in the river, along with the subtle painting of the distant, hazy mountain range suggest it was made to be admired close up by an educated patron. A precious object, it may have been protected in a velvet bag between viewings. It might have been made for Lorenzo de' <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, who adopted the laurel as part of his personal emblem and who associated himself with the fiery god Apollo.</p></div>
