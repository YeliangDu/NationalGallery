The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Maestà</span> was a five-tiered, double-sided altarpiece, and the focus of the devotion of the Virgin in Siena.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A gilded background gives this scene an ethereal quality, but the delicate arrangement of pink and grey columns and arches tells us that we are in fact on earth – we‘re in the home of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. Heaven has broken in: the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a>, his back heel lifted as he walks, strides in through a slightly pointed archway, his wings streaked through with gold. He blesses the Virgin with his right hand and in his left holds a white staff tipped with a fleur-de-lis, a stylised lily.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin, enclosed within an open arcade of soft grey stone, stands in front of an open door and draws her arm up across her breast in fear. The movement has created a sweeping fold in her blue cloak, revealing her red dress beneath and highlighting her belly. At the bottom edge of this curve of fabric is an open book; the Virgin has been interrupted while reading the Old Testament scriptures. The page is open at the words of the prophet Isaiah who foretold this moment: ’Behold a Virgin shall conceive and bear a son and shall call his name [Emmanuel].'</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This echoes the words Gabriel speaks to the Virgin in the biblical account, here, perhaps, standing in for them. Meanwhile the moment of conception occurs between the angel and the Virgin: the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> in the form of a small dove descends to impregnate the Virgin by means of the words she hears; it is encircled in gold, between three rays emanating from an arc of blue – the heavens. The vase of lilies embellishing the plain pink wall at the centre of the image represents the Virgin’s purity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio</a> has placed an extraordinary scene in an ordinary – and believable – setting. These religious figures aren’t oversized compared to the buildings, as they sometimes were in paintings made at this time; they fit perfectly into their surroundings. This, combined with the blue, pink, gold and soft lilacs, creates a sense of balance and harmony. The architecture’s simplicity makes it easy to see that the arches are pointed where the divine enters the scene (in the form of the angel, the dove of the Holy Ghost and the open door of the house). Pointed arches were the new style in Gothic architecture; Duccio’s selective use of this trend to accentuate the holy might mean he intended to express the Annunciation’s importance as the beginning of a new epoch, the beginning of the New Testament.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting comes from the far left edge of the front <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of a large double-sided <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> called the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HKS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Maestà</a></span>, made by Duccio for Siena Cathedral. It was the first in a series of images showing the infancy of Christ. Each scene was alternated with a full-length image of a prophet. Next to this scene is Isaiah holding a scroll with the same words as those in the Virgin’s open book.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Our collection also includes two paintings from the back predella, which showed images of Christ’s ministry: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FYN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Healing of the Man born Blind</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G02-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Transfiguration</a></span>.</p></div>

Jesus is shown wiping a mixture – made from mud and his own spit – over the man’s eyes. The man carries a stick to guide his steps; when he, shown again at the far right of the picture, washes his face in the nearby pool, he drops his stick and looks up, cured.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Duccio had help from a team of painters to complete the work.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting comes from the back of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of the large, double-sided altarpiece made for Siena Cathedral, known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HKS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Maestà</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jesus</a>, in a vivid blue robe edged with a fine gold line, places his finger over the eyelids of a man who clings to a stick made from a simple tree branch. The stick shows that he is blind – he uses it to guide his steps. This episode in Jesus’s ministry is told in the Gospel of John. Jesus and his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> came across a blind beggar. He made a paste from earth and is shown here wiping it across the man’s eyelids. Jesus then told him to go and wash in the pool of Siloam; after doing this, he was, according to witnesses, able to see again. At the right edge of the panel <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio</a> shows the man again, by the pool. He has laid down his stick, which he no longer needs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure of Jesus stooped over the man divides the scene into two. Behind him are his disciples, huddled together. The elder disciples, perhaps <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Peter</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paul</a>, are at the front of the crowd. Only the tops of the heads of those behind are visible, emphasising how dense the crowd is and giving the image a sense of depth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The detailed architectural structures of the background – with open doors and windows, archways and semi-enclosed courts – also add depth and complexity to the scene. The turreted towers and beamed ceilings reflect the architecture of a medieval city like Siena, rather than Roman-occupied Jerusalem where the event was believed to have taken place centuries earlier. Duccio has set one of Christ’s greatest miracles in the home town of the people who would have seen the painting, bringing it to life for them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pool of Siloam is represented as a small street fountain; green water gushes from the mouth of a sculpted lion’s head. This detail is found in other, earlier, Italian versions of the picture and also in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> manuscript; it is possible this image was drawn from a Byzantine manuscript. These versions also show the man twice, usually being healed and then washing his eyes in the pool. Here, the man instead looks up and raises his hand in amazement or reverence. The scene next to this one on the predella was <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Transfiguration</span> – when Jesus was filled with divine light. The blind man in this scene would have looked up towards the the transfigured Christ, acknowledging the source of his healing but also recalling Jesus’s words to his disciples as he healed the man: ‘While I am in the world, I am the light of the world’ (John 9: 5).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a>, which reveals the drawing beneath the paint, shows that two artists worked on this scene. Duccio himself probably drew the figures and sketched in the architecture but it seems to have been drawn more precisely by a different artist – one of Duccio’s assistants. If you look closely, you'll see fine indentations along the edges of the buildings and their features. These were made with a sharp pointed tool and a ruler to ensure their straightness and accuracy. Part of the blind man’s face, including both eyes and nose, has been restored.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ stands at the centre of this small square panel. The moment shown is the Transfiguration, when Jesus ascended a mountain and became filled with heavenly light, shown here by the golden striations (stripes) on his robes. Suddenly the Old Testament prophets Moses (on his left) and Elijah (on his right) appeared and began to speak with him. God then spoke, singling out Christ as divinely favoured: ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jesus’s disciples, at the bottom of the mountain, raise their hands in fear, dazzled by the sight. This scene was the eighth of nine images that formed the back of the predella (lowest part) of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Maestà</span>, a five-tiered, double-sided altarpiece. It was the focus of the devotion of the Virgin in Siena and it is the only known signed work by the city’s leading artist, Duccio di Buoninsegna.</p></div>

The moment shown is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Transfiguration</a>, when Christ ascended a mountain and according to the Gospel of Matthew, ‘he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his garments became white as light’ (Matthew 17: 2).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ stands between <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EEJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Moses</a> to the left and Elijah to the right. According to the Gospel, they appeared before him and began to speak with him. At this moment, a voice came from heaven: ‘This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him’ (Matthew 17: 5). The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> Peter, James and John are kneeling below. They raise their hands up to shield their faces and recoil in fear. The Transfiguration prefigured the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E55-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ascension</a>, when Christ ascended in glory from his tomb. This level of meaning was reinforced by the panel’s placement next to a scene showing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB8-0008-0000-0000.htm">raising of Lazarus</a>, a miracle in which Christ raised a man from the dead in anticipation of his own conquest of death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is suggested that the prophets' sombre brown and purple clothing – Moses wears an animal skin cloak – is deliberately dark in contrast with the bright reds, greens and blues of Christ and the disciples to show the revelation of the divine in the person of Christ. A large part of the body of the central kneeling figure, Saint John the Evangelist, has been damaged; originally his robes were entirely red. The damaged area has been restored but not repainted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was once part of the back <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio</a>’s large Sienese altarpiece, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HKS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Maestà</a></span>. It was positioned between <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FYN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Healing of the Man born Blind</a></span> and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Raising of Lazarus</span>. Unlike the front predella these scenes were not alternated with images of prophets but placed next to each other. Before the predella was cut into different scenes in the eighteenth century, the cured blind man in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FYN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Healing of the Man born Blind</a></span> was looking up towards the figure of the transfigured Christ here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a rare Italian painting featuring the Transfiguration – the event that prefigured Christ’s Resurrection, on Easter Day. The Feast of the Transfiguration (6 August) was not universally celebrated in the Western Christian Church in Duccio’s lifetime. Another example, a painting on canvas made in Siena four decades earlier by Guido da Siena, has a similar design. The original prototype comes from Byzantium, the Eastern Christian empire, where the feast was celebrated.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist shows John the Baptist leaving the city for the wilderness, where he lived a simple life preaching about Jesus Christ. We see his dainty figure twice in this scene, which is unusual in Italian art. He appears first leaving the city gates with a small bundle of possessions, and then climbing a steep path into the craggy mountains beyond. By including the fertile valley of patchwork fields below, the artist has highlighted the civilised place John leaves behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The delicately painted roses on either side of this panel are in different stages of bloom. Giovanni di Paolo used this type of floral decoration throughout his career. He might have picked it up from the Florentine painter Gentile da Fabriano, who included decorative flowers in the frame of his magnificent altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence) which Giovanni di Paolo probably saw when he visited Florence in the late 1430s.</p></div>

The Sienese painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio</a> sometimes also showed figures twice to help him tell a story in two parts.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">John bypasses the fertile valley planted with a variety of crops – all different shades of green – and heads instead for the mountainous, craggy landscape beyond. This is an Italian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> version of the desert or the wilderness of Israel. The two figures dominate the scene, oversized compared to the surroundings. This allowed the artist to show a vast landscape without losing sight of John within it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There was a tradition in Siena of painting expansive landscapes. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzetti brothers'</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> for the town hall (the Palazzo Pubblico) in Siena, painted in the 1340s, depict broad landscapes and cityscapes as though viewed from a distance. Giovanni di Paolo, a native of the city, would most certainly have been very familiar with those works. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has revealed the care that he  took to draw the architecture, particularly the gateway, accurately. Instead of drawing its outlines, he used a ruler and a pointed tool to score guidelines into the preparatory layer of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB6-0008-0000-0000.htm">gesso</a> to ensure that the painted lines were straight. This technique was also used by Duccio in his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FYN-0001-0000-0000.htm">predella panel of the healing of the man born blind</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The delicately painted roses on either side of this panel are in different stages of bloom. We can see the underside of the petals of each flower, as originally the viewer would have been looking up at the scene from below. Giovanni di Paolo used this type of floral decoration throughout his career. He might have picked it up from the painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PSQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gentile da Fabriano</a>, who included decorative flowers in the frame of his magnificent altarpiece of the Adoration of the Magi (now in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence), which Giovanni di Paolo probably saw when he visited Florence in the late 1430s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s rare to see a scene of John entering the wilderness in Italian painting, but it is depicted in a sculpted bronze panel made by Andrea Pisano for the door of the Florence Baptistery in the 1330s. It also features in thirteenth-century mosaics inside the Baptistery.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Fabian and Saint Sebastian, wounded by arrows, are shown together with two tiny figures wearing black cloaks with hoods and white veils. Medieval Christians prayed to both saints as protectors against the plague.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Fabian was pope in the third century and is shown wearing a papal tiara; he was martyred under the Roman Emperor Decius. Sebastian was tortured by the Emperor Diocletian who ordered his soldiers to tie him to a stake and shoot him with arrows. He survived, but was later beaten to death. Thick droplets of vivid red blood ooze from each of his wounds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made in Siena, and it’s likely that it was commissioned by the religious group to which the little kneeling figures belonged. They may represent a group called the Bianchi – who had an altar dedicated to the saints in the eighteenth century – although they usually wore all white. This large panel may have originally been painted on both sides and carried in religious processions.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Fabian, on the left, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a> tower above two tiny kneeling figures wearing black hooded robes with long white veils and holding objects that look like paddles. Certain religious groups used instruments like this for self-flagellation – the practice of whipping yourself as a punishment for sin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Fabian was pope in the third century and was killed by the Roman Emperor Decius. He is shown dressed in papal robes and tiara – the three-tiered crown. His white cope is woven with golden thread and studded with pearls. Saint Sebastian is shown naked but for a translucent loin cloth. He has curly blonde hair, wiry calf muscles, bony knees and a muscular abdomen. He is pierced by 20 arrows, each wound oozing droplets of blood. The vibrant red pigment of the droplets is one of the best-preserved elements of the picture. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, a thirteenth-century compilation of the lives of the saints, Saint Sebastian was tied to a post and shot by Emperor Diocletian’s soldiers: ‘They shot so many arrows into his body that he looked like a porcupine.’ He miraculously survived this torture but was later beaten to death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both saints were both thought to protect Christians against the plague and they share a feast day on 20 January – so they were often shown together. Sebastian converted many people to Christianity and in doing so they were cured of their diseases.  Centuries later in the northern Italian town of Pavia, the citizens suffered a deadly plague which was stopped only when they built and dedicated an altar to Saint Sebastian.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the eighteenth-century in Siena, the city in which this picture was made, a religious group called the Bianchi had an altar dedicated to Fabian and Sebastian, also hoping for protection against plague. So the kneeling figures we see could be members of the Bianchi, though they were renowned for wearing all white – but we just don't know for sure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The original use of this picture is mysterious: there are no signs that it ever formed part of an altarpiece, and there is no evidence to suggest that it was ever attached to other panels. Independent panels were popular in Siena for private prayer but this panel is too large to have been used for that. It is almost a metre in height, and the frame is original except for at the bottom edge where it has been replaced.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel has been thinned down on the reverse and so it is possible that it was painted on both sides. If so, it may have been used in religious processions where both sides would have been visible at once. The damage to the lower edge – which led to it being replaced – might have been caused by a pole, inserted so the picture could be carried as a banner in processions.</p></div>

The symmetry of this scene resembles the one that Ghiberti made to decorate the doors of the Florence Baptistery. The poses and gestures look like those in the scene Ghiberti made for a baptismal font in Siena – where Giovanni di Paolo worked.</p></div>

Two wingless angels stand on the bank; one has a white robe – it probably belongs to Christ – slung over his shoulders.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s baptism is considered the beginning of his ministry and the moment that his work and teachings received divine authority. This painting comes from a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HGK-0001-0000-0000.htm">series of panels</a> that tell the story of the life of John the Baptist, which once formed a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">John preached that he was sent by God to baptise – here we see God the Father in the sky above Christ, surrounded by angels. The orange wings that frame him belong to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRW-0008-0000-0000.htm">seraphim</a>, divine creatures who guard his throne. Beneath God, descending towards Christ in golden rays, is a dove, the symbol of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The scene reflects John’s testimony of what happened when he baptised Christ: ‘I saw the Spirit descend as a dove from heaven, and it remained on him. And I have seen and have borne witness that this is the Son of God.’ (John 1: 32–4).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Scenes of John the Baptist were more common in Florence, where he was patron saint, than in Siena, where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7H-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni di Paolo</a> came from. The symmetrical design of this panel shows that the artist was inspired by the works of the Florentine sculptor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Ghiberti</a>, who had made a scene of Christ’s baptism to decorate the doors of the Florence Baptistery. In it, Christ stands in the middle of the river framed by figures on the banks on either side. Giovanni di Paolo almost certainly visited Florence in the 1430s, where he would have seen the doors.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arrangement and poses of the figures closely resemble another sculpted bronze panel by Ghiberti, made for the baptismal font of Siena Cathedral, which Giovanni di Paolo would certainly have known.</p></div>

He is propped up on his wet-nurse’s knee, his arms wrapped around her neck. His mother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EC6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Elizabeth</a> sleeps in the large bed behind, the shape of her legs visible under the covers. Her golden halo blends into her gilded bedstead which, like the foot of the bed, is decorated with little figures playing musical instruments. These are probably angels; their costume resembles those of angels in religious paintings of this period. Beds painted with religious subjects still survive – there is one painted with a scene of the Virgin and Child in the Ospedale del Ceppo in Pistoia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of John the Baptist’s birth is recorded in the first chapter of the Gospel of Luke. His father Zacharias, shown here as an old man, received a vision when he was making an offering in the temple. An angel appeared and told him that he and his wife would have a son and they would call him John. Zacharias was amazed: he and Elizabeth had never been able to conceive and were now both elderly. The angel punished him for his disbelief, saying, ‘you will be silent and unable to speak until the day that these things come to pass, because you did not believe my words, which will be fulfilled in their time.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As he couldn‘t speak, we see Zacharias writing John’s name in the book resting on his knee. According to the Gospel account, it was very unusual that they called him John, a name not used by their family. It was more common to name a son after his father. Here, however, Zacharias fulfils the words of the angel Gabriel. By including this detail Giovanni di Paolo makes reference to the divine nature of John’s birth without having to include the scene of Zacharias’s angelic vision.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has arranged the scene in a similar way to images that show the birth of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, which were often – like this – painted on a small scale. The furnishings of the room are positioned at an awkward angle – the wall that includes the chimney converges with the foot of the bed to form a narrow ’V' – but this allows the artist to include the painted bed and the fire where the maid dries a cloth. On the floor next to her are the gilded jug and basin that have been used to wash the baby. An archway at the back of the room leads through to further open doorways, giving the impression of the other rooms in the house.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the most striking elements of the picture is Zacharias’s gracefully rippling blue drapery. Technical analysis shows that the artist drew this spontaneously freehand, directly onto the prepared panel, before painting over it.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the final scene in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HGK-0001-0000-0000.htm">series of panels</a> that tell the story of the life of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>, which once formed a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>. It shows the moment that Herod, King of the Jews, was presented with John’s head on a plate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of the saint’s execution is told in the Gospel of Matthew. Salome – we see her here in a pink dress – was the daughter of Herod’s wife and danced for Herod at a feast. He was so delighted with Salome’s dancing that he promised to give her whatever she wanted. Her mother, Herodias, asked her to demand the head of John the Baptist. Herodias bore a grudge against John – he had criticised her marriage to Herod, as she had previously been married to his brother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Herod knew that many people revered John and believed him to be a prophet, and so did not want to kill him. Nonetheless, he kept his word. Here we see him appalled at the sight of the saint’s decapitated head. His guests cover their eyes, unable to look at the grisly sight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like in the first scene of the series, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELP-0001-0000-0000.htm">which shows the saint’s birth</a>, here <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7H-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni di Paolo</a> has included archways which lead into other rooms in the background. To the right we see a glimpse of a garden with a trellis and rosebush. These details give the impression that the feast is taking place in a grand and spacious setting – Herod’s palace. As with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPX-0001-0000-0000.htm">the scene of the baptism of Christ</a>, Giovanni di Paolo seems to have been inspired by a sculpted bronze panel made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a> and Giovanni di Turino for the font of the Baptistery in Siena in around 1427, which shows the presentation of the saint’s head to Herod. It seems to have inspired both the architectural setting and the gestures and arrangement of the figures.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the 1330s the Sienese city council commissioned four altarpieces showing scenes from the life of the Virgin Mary, the city’s protector, to decorate the cathedral. This panel by Pietro Lorenzetti, one of the city’s most important artists, comes from the altarpiece dedicated to the birth of the Virgin which was placed upon the altar of Saint Sabinus, one of the city’s patron saints.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene comes from the lower part of the altarpiece, called the predella. It shows the moment, according to legend, that the saint smashed a pagan idol – the small goddess in white robes – in order to demonstrate the powerlessness of Roman deities. Sabinus was thought, mistakenly, to be the first Bishop of Siena. Here he is shown wearing a bishop’s mitre, accompanied by his two deacons who were tortured to death as punishment for his act. Eventually, however, Sabinus converted the Roman Governor, Venustianus, seated on the right on a regal stool made to resemble twisted lion’s forms. Both men were martyred for their faith.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small panel shows the story of Saint Sabinus, Bishop of Spoleto and one of the patron saints of Siena, provoking the wrath of the Roman governor, Venustianus, by challenging the power of the pagan deities.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Venustianus is seated on the stool carved to resemble contorted lions’ forms. He had threatened Sabinus, wearing a bishop’s mitre, with death unless he sacrificed one of his companions to the pagan gods. In response Sabinus, accompanied here by his two deacons Marcellus and Exuperantius, asked for one of these gods to be brought to him. The statue which has been fetched is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, dressed in a long white gown and holding the golden apple awarded to her by the Trojan prince, Paris, as a prize for being the most beautiful goddess. The legend of Saint Sabinus in fact refers to a statue of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a> but Lorenzetti may have chosen Venus instead as a play on Venustianus’s name.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After prayer, Sabinus took the statue and smashed it to pieces. By way of punishment, Venustianus tortured his deacons to death. Venustianus spared Sabinus – and Sabinus later cured him of blindness, an event that spurred his own conversion to Christianity. Both he and Sabinus were eventually martyred for their faith. Pietro may have chosen this story from Sabinus’s life as it provided a parallel to the main story of Saint Bartholomew’s life, which told of his refusal to worship pagan idols and was probably depicted on the predella.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture comes from a much larger altarpiece showing the birth of the Virgin made for the Cathedral in the Tuscan town of Siena. Pietro Lorenzetti and his brother Ambrogio were two of the city’s most sought-after painters at this time – in the previous decade they had completed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> for the facade of the Ospedale of Santa Maria della Scala, a hospital for abandoned children and the sick opposite the Cathedral, and for one of the council rooms in the town hall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pietro’s altarpiece was one of four commissioned for the Cathedral by the city’s council which depicted key events from the life of the Virgin. The central image of the Virgin’s birth was flanked by images of Saints Sabinus and Saint Bartholomew. Saint Sabinus, whose relics were buried in the Cathedral was one of Siena’s patron Saints; he was mistakenly thought to be the first Bishop of Siena. This scene is the only surviving panel of a series of narrative scenes running across the bottom of the altarpiece, called the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>. These would have shown episodes from the lives of these saints as well as some scenes from the life of the Virgin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The main panel is now in Siena’s Cathedral museum. The other three altarpieces – painted by Siena’s most important artists– were dedicated to other events in the Virgin’s life surrounded by more of the city’s patron saints.  They were: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Annunciation</span> by Simone Martini and Lippo Memmi (Uffizi, Florence), <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Purification</span> by Ambrogio Lorenzetti (Uffizi, Florence) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Nativity</span> – now lost – possibly by Bartolommeo Bulgarini.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was donated to the Gallery by Charles Fairfax Murray who acted as an agent for the Gallery in the late nineteenth century. With his help the Gallery secured a number of Sienese pictures of this period which was then little known to collectors.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made early in Simone Martini’s career in Siena. Dated 1320, it shows Saint John the Evangelist before a stone parapet, his brow furrowed and hands clasped in an attitude of acute grief. Mirroring his emotional state, Simone depicts the drapery of his mantle and robe with expressive, nervous contours to echo the saint’s tense and anguished expression.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Evidence of the original hinges survives on the left edge of the panel, confirming that it was designed to be attached to another image. Originally, the panel probably formed the right wing of a devotional triptych. Saint John’s gaze would likely have been directed towards a central depiction of the dead Christ (Man of Sorrows), with an image of the grieving Virgin Mary forming the left wing. As often found with paintings designed to be portable, the reverse of the panel is decorated with a design intended to evoke inlaid stone, or the leather cover of a book.</p></div>

      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Since it first became known to scholars in 1932, this painting has been celebrated as an early masterpiece by the great Sienese painter, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PS1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Simone Martini</a>. Below the saint, on the marble ledge before him, the panel is dated to 1320, a moment when Simone was rapidly establishing himself as Siena’s leading painter, following the death of<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Duccio di Buoninsegna</a> a year before.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a> placed behind a parapet of pale marble veined with green and pink. Identifiable by his youthful appearance and the red and blue robes he wears (the colours he wears in Duccio’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FYN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Healing of the Man born Blind</a>), he furrows his brow and clasps his hands together in a state of acute, tumultuous grief. The emotional tenor of his face and pose is echoed by the remarkably expressive drapery which flows around his body, its nervous and constantly changing lines echoing John’s tense and anguished expression. With characteristic sensitivity, Simone conveys not just the drama of the saint’s emotions, but balances this with an elegance and decorum which came to define his art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint John’s inclined head and insistent gaze toward the left suggest that he was originally conceived to look toward another image. His pose and attitude are familiar from contemporary depictions of Christ’s crucifixion, and it seems most likely that the object of his agonised attention would have been an image of the dead Christ (<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows</a>). This painting is now lost, but surviving evidence on the Saint John panel provides clues about the work’s original format. Still intact within its surviving original frame, the painting bears traces of hinges on the left-hand side. This demonstrates that the panel was designed to form part of a folding ensemble, most likely a small devotional triptych. This would have had a central panel of the Man of Sorrows, flanked on the right by Saint John the Evangelist and on the left by the grieving Virgin Mary. The prominent inscribed date on the present picture would have formed the end of a longer inscription running along the lower edges of the now lost companion panels, which would probably have included Simone’s name and a statement of his authorship.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that the three component panels would have been the same size. This makes reconstruction of the triptych’s original appearance and format somewhat complex, since it would not have been able to close in a conventional manner (with narrower wing panels closing over a wide central element). Again, however, physical evidence holds clues which can help in proposing a reconstruction of Simone’s original design. The hinge marks on the Saint John panel are found not at the front edge of the frame, as might be expect if the panel was intended to simply fold inwards, but instead are located on the rear left-hand edge, suggesting it must have folded in a slightly different way. The most likely reconstruction of the whole triptych proposes that the left panel of the Virgin would have been fixed to the central panel in a conventional manner and would have folded directly over the Man of Sorrows. The right-hand panel of Saint John the Evangelist would have been hinged in such a way that it could be folded over the top of the other two and then probably secured with a clasp. The attachments, secured to the rear left-hand edge of the panel, may have been pieces of leather, long enough to allow the panel to be folded up and over the other panels in this way. A similar format was used for another hinged triptych of equally sized panels depicting the Virgin, the Man of Sorrows and Saint John the Evangelist by a 14th-century Venetian painter, now in Dordrecht (private collection). When folded, the Saint John panel would have been the outermost of the three, with the back of the painting as the only visible part. As would be expected for a portable panel painting of this type, the reverse is painted with a design intended to evoke inlaid stone, or the leather binding of a book.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When fully open, Simone’s triptych would have presented an affecting image for private devotion. Focusing on the body of Christ as its central theme, the imagery was designed to encourage its viewer to contemplate his sufferings during the Passion and to engage emotionally with his plight. No evidence survives about who the triptych was originally painted for. The Man of Sorrows was a popular image, especially among the mendicant (preaching) orders who promoted close engagement with the suffering body of Christ among their members and adherents. The particular focus of the original triptych on the body of Christ has led to the suggestion that it may have been made for a Dominican patron, or someone whose devotional interests aligned with that order. Christ’s body would have suggested strong allusions to the Eucharist, the consecrated bread understood to become the physical body of Christ at the Mass. During the early years of the 14th century in Italy, the significance of the Eucharist was gaining in importance, particularly in Dominican circles. This eventually culminated in the official ratification of the Feast of the Corpus Christi in 1317 and the canonisation of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Thomas Aquinas</a> in 1323, a Dominican theologian who had been influential in encouraging these devotions. Such connections may have been important for the person who commissioned Simone’s painting and perhaps suggest something about the devotional environment for which this remarkable work was created.</p></div>

The flesh is underpainted with green earth. This was a sophisticated optical device used by Trecento painters to suggest the cool mid-tones of human skin (it is perhaps now more visible here than was originally intended).

Even small details, such as the white line along the top of the lips, are copied from Duccio.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The precise dating of the Albertini Master’s works and the extent of his oeuvre are still under debate. This painting seems to sit between his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Virgin and Child</span>, which is very similar to the work of Duccio, and his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Virgin and Child Enthroned</span>, which more closely resembles the work of Giotto (both Pinacoteca, Siena). He was an eclectic painter, drawing details from a variety of Sienese artists, including the Badia a Isola Master and the Master of Città di Castello, with whom he perhaps shared a workshop: both used the same five-petal rosette tool to punch the gilded background. They might even have been brothers working in close collaboration, like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrogio</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q93-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pietro Lorenzetti</a>. There were numerous families of painters working together in fourteenth-century Siena, as throughout Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is said to have came from Santa Croce, Florence, and might have been commissioned by a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a>, the Laudesi, that met in the Bardi Vernio chapel there. If this provenance is correct, the painting would have been the second Sienese picture made for a confraternity attached to a major Florentine church, Duccio’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rucellai Madonna</span> having been the first.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the 1950s, the painting was transferred from its original wooden panel to a synthetic support. When the back was exposed, drawings of a sphinx, a game board and what may have been either a window or a bishop’s mitre became visible.</p></div>

His youthful body is lean and muscly and he gracefully rests his weight on one leg, a pose called contrapposto which was used in ancient sculpture of the pagan gods.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The strength of his body, upright pose and calm gaze are at odds with the 12 arrows that pierce his flesh. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, a thirteenth-century compilation of the lives of the saints, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a> – a Roman soldier who secretly became a Christian – was tied to a post and shot by Emperor Diocletian’s soldiers: ‘They shot so many arrows into his body that he looked like a porcupine.’ He miraculously survived this torture but was later beaten to death. Matteo has shown Sebastian victorious over death, crowned by two angels that hover above. In his left hand he holds another golden crown, as though a prize for a young athlete; in his right, a palm leaf, the traditional symbol of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During his lifetime Saint Sebastian converted many people to Christianity; according to his legend, they were then cured of their diseases. He was a popular saint in Italy in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLD-0008-0000-0000.htm">late medieval</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> periods and very often chosen for paintings as he was thought to protect Christians against the plague. This picture may have been made as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM5-0008-0000-0000.htm">votive</a> image – a picture dedicated to the saint to ask for his protection, or in thanks for a cure. Alternatively it may have formed part of a multi-panelled altarpiece, or simply been used for private prayer to the saint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sebastian’s spiritual might is expressed in the giant scale of his body, which seems excessively large in comparison with the mountains beyond. These apparently oversized holy figures, dominating their surroundings, were a feature of Matteo’s later works (see, for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOC-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Assumption of the Virgin</a></span>). The arid landscape with its small sprigs of greenery in a sandy ground recalls that of his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Assumption</span>, as well as that of Piero della Francesca’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a></span>. Matteo was certainly aware of Piero’s works and the sculptural effect of Sebastian’s body echoes that of Christ in Piero’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR4-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Baptism of Christ</a></span>.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This magnificent and imposing vision of the Virgin Mary’s body and soul being taken to heaven was the central panel of a large polyptych (a multi-panelled altarpiece). It was made for the monastery of Sant'Agostino in Asciano, in the countryside near the Tuscan town of Siena.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin is shown rising in majesty, high above the hills, trees and river of the landscape, her empty tomb below her. Saint Thomas strains to catch a pink ribbon – this is the Virgin’s belt, or girdle, which, according to legend, the Virgin dropped for him. Thomas had also touched Christ’s wounded side after the Resurrection. In both instances, Thomas served to prove the truth of the bodily resurrection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The city of Siena was dedicated to the protection of the Virgin Mary, and many glorious images of her could be found there. By commissioning an image like this, Asciano and other surrounding towns were showing their own devotion while emulating Siena.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This glorious celebration of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> was discovered in the nineteenth century in a wood store in the Tuscan town of Asciano, just outside Siena. The store belonged to a monastery of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Augustinian</a> monks. The painting was most probably originally made for choir of the monastery’s church, Sant‘Agostino.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bulky figure of the Virgin dominates the scene. Placed centrally in an almost symmetrical pose, she is considerably larger than the angels and saints surrounding her. Her tomb lies open and empty as she ascends into heaven where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, hovering above, awaits her, along with saints and Old Testament figures. She wears a white damask cloak that opens to reveal her womb and belly, framed by her hands held together in prayer; this highlights her role as the mother of Christ. As she rises, her belt, or girdle, has loosened and is falling to earth. According to legend, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FH2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Thomas</a> caught it. Here he is shown, fingers straining, grappling to reach it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin rests upon a throne of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRW-0008-0000-0000.htm">Seraphim</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cherubim</a>  – the red and blue angelic beings with multiple wings. Around her, angels, their hair wreathed with flowers, play musical instruments. The four at the base of the throne have delicately curved soles that match the arch of their backs – their energetic poses make it seem as though they are propelling themselves through the air. Their arched backs create a graceful, symmetrical frame for the Virgin, and the folds of their draperies are highlighted with white paint, as through they are reflecting light emanated by her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Scenes showing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6O-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin’s assumption</a> provided artists with the opportunity to paint vast landscapes with tiny trees and buildings, a bird’s eye view that enhances the sense of the Virgin’s distance from the earth. For example, it is a technique also used by Matteo di Giovanni’s Florentine contemporary, Franceso Botticini, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJE-0001-0000-0000.htm">in his version of the image</a>. The walled hillside town to the left of the landscape may represent Asciano with its two churches, Sant’ Agostino and Sant' Agata; the river winding through the expansive valley could be the Ombrone, which runs through a nearby plain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel formed the centre of a multi-panelled altarpiece (a polyptych). There were probably panels on either side, probably showing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Augustine</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Michael</a>. Panels above probably showed the Archangel Gabriel on one side and the Virgin Mary on the other – so depicting <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">the annunciation of Christ’s birth</a>. It is likely that there were also supporting <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilaster</a> panels decorated with saints, as well as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>, perhaps showing scenes from the life of Saint Augustine.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of Mary’s assumption were important in Siena, a city that was devoted to the Virgin Mary ever since its citizens, according to legend, had won a battle against the Florentines after dedicating Siena to her protection. The Feast of the Assumption on 15 August was a key celebration in many Sienese churches. The commission of a high altarpiece with such a large and impressive image of the Virgin was a way for towns in the region, like Asciano, to express their allegiance to their capital city.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a rare example of a work by Niccolò di Buonaccorso – one of the most gifted Sienese artists of the fourteenth century. The panel belongs to a series of three: the others show the Virgin as a child in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Presentation of the Virgin</span> (Uffizi, Florence) and  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Coronation of the Virgin</span> by Christ after her death (Lehman Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to legend the Virgin had many suitors who took part in a competition for her hand in marriage. They all took rods to the Temple and the one whose rod flowered was successful. Joseph’s rod has sprouted leaves and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove has landed upon it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has included his hometown in his signature: NICHOLAVS. BONACHVRSI. DE SENIS. ME P[I]NXIT (‘Niccolò di Buonaccorso of Siena painted me’). This suggests the picture may have been made for a patron who was not from Siena. The marriage of the Virgin was more popular in Florence than Siena.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little boy in red stockings and an elaborately embroidered gown looks on as Joseph places a gold ring upon the Virgin’s finger. A priest – wearing a heavily-gilded and jewelled cloak, and a white hat with a gilded border – joins the couple’s hands; the Virgin and her attendants, in equally splendid gowns, are accompanied by minstrels playing trumpets and drums, known as nakers. The haloed figures in simple robes are Mary’s parents, Joachim and Anna.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of the competition leading to the Virgin’s marriage comes from a thirteenth-century text known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span>. Her suitors presented wooden rods at the Temple and the man whose branch miraculously blossomed was to be the victor. Joseph is barefoot; his rod has sprouted leaves and the Holy Spirit in the form of a dove has landed on it. Behind him, unsuccessful suitors hold their barren rods. On the far left of the scene one of them breaks his over his knee in frustration.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist of this little panel has signed it in gold: NICHOLAVS. BONACHVRSI. DE SENIS. ME P[I]NXIT (‘Niccolò di Buonaccorso of Siena painted me’). Niccolò was one of the most gifted Sienese painters but very few of his works survive. Those that do are painted as here, with exquisite detail and vibrant colours. The Marriage of the Virgin was not a common scene in Siena but it was popular in Florence, suggesting that this work was made for a Florentine patron. This might explain why Niccolò included his hometown in his signature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Colourful details match the celebratory nature of the event: striking chequered red, yellow and blue carpet woven with birds has been laid upon the green and yellow stone of an open courtyard. Beyond the town is a lush orchard. A palm laden with dates towers over the central arch in the distance. A pine tree and an orange tree are visible through the balustrade – decorated with tri-lobed arches – that encloses the scene. Similar delicate architectural features, resembling those found in fourteenth-century churches, adorn the windows of the upper storeys of the surrounding buildings. The gilded frame with its multi-lobed arches and decorative details complements the painted architecture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that this panel formed the central image in a series of three paintings depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin. The other scenes show the Virgin as a child in The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Presentation of the Virgin</span> (Uffizi, Florence) and  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Coronation of the Virgin</span> by Christ after her death (Lehman Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). All three are also decorated on the reverse with silver leaf and painted with the same diamond pattern suggesting the backs were intended to be visible. They may have been joined together to form a portable altarpiece but no evidence of any hinges remains.</p></div>

He continued to act with charity towards the poor, however, and one day gave the expensive clothes he was wearing to a poor knight. The next night God sent him a vision of a great palace, hung with banners decorated with the cross of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, and promised it to him and his soldiers. At first Francis took this literally, setting off to the wars in Apulia, but he later realised it represented the army of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan friars</a> he was to found.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This the first of eight paintings from the back of  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">a large, richly coloured and elaborate altarpiece</a>, one of the outstanding artistic commissions of fifteenth-century Italy. This panel originally sat in the top left-hand corner of the altarpiece, next to <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis renounces his Earthly Father</a></span>. In general these narrative scenes follow the text of Francis’s official biography, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Bonaventure</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Legenda Maior</span>, with some details from other sources.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the left of this panel, the youthful saint has dismounted his horse and is taking off his outer garment to give to the thin-faced nobleman next to him. Francis’s elegant dress contrasts vividly with the knight’s ragged clothing: his spurs are silver and his robe is silver, incised with tiny vertical strokes, and painted over with red lake <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>. On the right, the saint lies in bed, the richness of his home emphasised by the use of gold for the bedhead, cover and pillow. An angel with golden wings hovers over him, pointing to a castle in the sky. White banners with red crosses flutter from its battlements.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scripta</span>, the document detailing the scenes to be depicted on the altarpiece, had asked only that the panel depict the moment ‘when Saint Francis was shown that palace’. However, a certain amount of freedom was left to the two friars who acted as Sassetta’s artistic advisers, and to the artist himself. In the literary sources, Saint Francis is granted the vision as a reward for his generosity to the poor knight, and the first scene is also depicted in the Upper Church of San Francesco, Assisi, which Sassetta or his advisers might have known. The theme of poverty and its rewards runs through the altarpiece, perhaps encouraged by the stringent attitudes of the Observant (reformed) Franciscans, which attracted much interest at the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the altarpiece was very carefully planned, some pentimenti or alterations are visible even to the naked eye: the horse’s tail was originally longer than it was painted, and lines for architecture were incised, but not always used. Arcs for arches and circles for halos were planned using a compass.</p></div>

Over the doorway is the papal coat of arms, with crossed keys; these also decorate the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a> behind the pope.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This the third of eight panels depicting scenes from Saint Francis’s life, made as part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">sumptuous double-sided altarpiece</a> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassetta</a>. It was completed in 1444 for the friars of Borgo San Sepolcro. The back showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Francis in Glory</span> (Berenson Collection, Villa I Tatti, Settignano) surrounded by these episodes from the saint’s life, seven of which are in our collection. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scripta</span>, the written instructions setting out the subject matter for the altarpiece, this scene shows Pope Honorious III granting Francis the Indulgence of the Portiuncula in 1216. Francis had boldly asked Honorius for a plenary indulgence (one that grants complete remission of sins) to be given to pilgrims visiting the Portiuncula, a tiny chapel which Francis had reconstructed and which was the cradle of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a>, on 1 and 2 August. To the amazement of the cardinals, the Pope approved. The Portiuncula Indulgence still takes place yearly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a rare scene and Sassetta seems not to have had access to a written account of the granting of the indulgence. Instead, he adapted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrogio Lorenzetti</a>’s painting  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Louis of Toulouse before Pope Boniface VII</span> (San Francesco, Siena). This explains the inclusion of a king, an unlikely figure at the papal court: Lorenzetti’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> included Saint Louis’s father, Charles of Anjou, who was present on that occasion. The friars of Borgo San Sepolcro may have requested this episode because they believed, wrongly, that the Blessed Ranieri Rasini, a local holy man who was buried below the altar at San Sepolcro, had witnessed this event. The friar at the far left, turning to look over his shoulder, is possibly intended to represent Ranieri. The prominence of the Pope’s hands, which have a red circle in the centre of his white glove, may be an allusion to Francis’s stigmatisation, which was shown in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Stigmatisation of Saint Francis</a></span>. The stigmata were understood in Franciscan theology as Christ’s seal upon the indulgence Pope Honorius had granted Francis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece from which this panel comes was constructed and painted in Sassetta’s workshop in Siena and then assembled at San Sepolcro. The main tier and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXD-0008-0000-0000.htm">pinnacles</a> consisted of four separate vertical planks, painted on both sides and dowelled together so they were easy to transport (this method was also used by Taddeo di Bartolo for his altarpiece at San Franceso al Prato, Perugia, which was one of the models for Sassetta’s altarpiece). The eight scenes of Francis’s life were painted in pairs on the backs, with four standing saints on the other side. When the altarpiece was dismantled, the panels were sawn down the middle: the standing saints are now divided between the Berenson Collection at Settignano and the Louvre, Paris.</p></div>

He and his companion, Brother Illuminatio, were captured and taken before al Malik al Kamil, Sultan of Egypt and Syria, who was defending Damietta from the Christian forces. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Legenda Maior</span>, Francis’s official biography, he attempted to convert the Sultan to Christianity by offering to go through fire for this faith. The Sultan politely declined his offer and sent him back to the Christian army.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Sultan, in a white turban and with fair hair, sits on a raised throne under a green and pink arcade. In the centre, Francis makes the sign of the Cross and prepares to step into the curling flames. Brother Illuminatio looks on, along with various members of the Sultan’s court, some in turbans (perhaps the imams who had refused the saint’s challenge). Through an arched doorway at the back of the building we can see a barren wilderness with rocky hills, one topped with towers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting comes from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">San Sepolcro Altarpiece</a></span>, a large and complex <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassetta</a> for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscans</a> of Borgo San Sepolcro. The back showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Francis in Glory</span> (Berenson Collection, Villa I Tatti, Settignano) surrounded by eight episodes from his life, seven of which are in our collection. This panel was in the top row, on the right-hand side, next to <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZM-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Wolf of Gubbio</a></span>. The landscape in this panel continued from that painting: the two stories were together treated as examples of Francis’s preaching and peacemaking by the influential Franciscan writer Bartolomeo da Pisa, whose writings inform various aspects of the altarpiece’s iconography.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Francis did not actually walk through the flames, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scripta</span>, the written instructions which the friars gave the artist, told Sassetta to show ‘when he [Francis] appeared before the Sultan and entered the fire’. As elsewhere in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">San Sepolcro Altarpiece</a></span>, the artist has used large amounts of gold and silver, some of which is badly worn: the picture would originally have been brighter and shinier. The swirling flames were originally painted in vermillion <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> over gold; the exposed gilding was stippled with a metal punch to give a sense of the movement of a flickering fire. The Sultan’s tunic was originally white over gold – the pattern was scratched into the white pigment to reveal the gold beneath (a technique known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffito</span>) – while the costume of the figure with a sword on the right was silver with a red lake glaze. His sword and belt are blue over silver, which has darkened, as has the robe of the standing figure with the pink turban.</p></div>

The saint’s discarded boots, shirt and hose lie in a heap on the floor. To the left, Francis’s father, dressed in a stylish pink hat and a cloak with a decorative clasp, has snatched up his son’s costly red robe. He gesticulates angrily at Francis while his companion tries to restrain him. Others watch in consternation, but in the background a cleric walks by peacefully reading a book, seemingly unaware of the furore.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the second of eight panels from the back of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">San Sepolcro Altarpiece</a></span> that narrate episodes from Saint Francis’s life; they surrounded a large central image of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Francis in Glory</span> (Berenson Collection, Villa I Tatti, Settignano). The altarpiece was painted for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan friars</a> of Borgo San Sepolcro, for the high altar of their church there. Seven of the eight narrative scenes are in the National Gallery’s collection – this one would have been in the top row, immediately to the left of the central panel representing the saint’s ecstasy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Francis’s rejection of his father occurred not long after the episode depicted in the adjacent panel, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis meets a Knight Poorer than Himself and Saint Francis’s Vision of the Founding of the Franciscan Order</a></span>, and was another step in Francis’s renunciation of the world, a kind of inverse ‘rags to riches’ story. The two paintings were conceived as a pair: the receding lines of their architecture share a common focal point. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Legenda Maior</span>, the saint’s official biography, Francis sold his horse and some textiles and gave the money to the church. This enraged his father, a rich businessman, who wanted his son to become a merchant. He appealed to the bishop, seeking to disinherit his ungrateful son; in response, Saint Francis tore off his clothes and gave them back to his father, saying he no longer had any father but God.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The symbolism of dress runs through both this and the preceding scene: Francis gives his clothes to a poor knight and then casts them aside completely as a sign of his rejection of the world. His well-dressed father (silver has been detected under the blue of his robe) clutches Francis’s luxurious outer garment (silver with a red glaze, as in the related scene of Francis meeting the poor knight) while the bishop covers the naked saint with his cope. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassetta</a> seems to have known <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> of this scene at San Francesco d'Assisi. In it, Francis’s father carries his son’s clothes over his arm in the same way and is also restrained by his companions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sassetta has used architecture to add meaning to the scene. The pink arcades with their multiple piers and capitals and blue groin vaults  perhaps signify a church or monastery that protects the bishop and the saint, but excludes Francis’s angry father, and by extension the material world he represents, who remains outside its walls. Physically restrained by his companions, only his outstretched arm reaches across the divide towards his errant son.</p></div>

This is Iacopa dei Settesoli, a Roman matron and close friend of Saint Francis. When he felt death approaching, Francis asked for a letter to be written to her, asking – among other things – for her to bring his favourite cakes, but she miraculously arrived before the missive was sent and was present at his deathbed. She later bore witness to the stigmata (the wounds <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> received at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, which Francis also miraculously experienced).

He also painted the verification of the stigmata, a change perhaps prompted by a desire to portray Francis as a second Christ by emphasising the stigmata. By the fifteenth century, however, the two were commonly conflated into a single scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Details of this painting suggest it was originally planned to include a standard element of Saint Francis’s death: the vision of the friar who saw the saint’s soul carried up to heaven. Unused incised lines for the architecture suggest that the vault was originally intended to be lower down, and indeed the friar on the left is gazing upwards, as if looking at something above him which is not there.</p></div>

Christ has the six wings of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRW-0008-0000-0000.htm">seraphim</a> and his arms are extended as if on the Cross. Rays from Christ’s stigmata – the wounds he received at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> – impress the same wounds on Saint Francis. Both the saint and the rocky landscape with its tiny chapel are illuminated by the light emanating from Christ; Francis’s body and the fingers of his raised left hand cast a shadow on the ground behind him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The stigmatisation, the culminating miracle of Francis’s life, occurred in 1224. According to his official biography, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Legenda Maior</span>, he spent 40 days fasting and praying on Mount La Verna, near Arezzo. One morning when deep in prayer, he had a vision of seraphim embracing the crucified Christ. When the vision vanished, he found that his hands and feet were marked as if nails were protruding from front and back, and a scar appeared on his side, which welled blood – tokens of his spiritual transformation into another Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is the fourth of eight scenes representing the life of Saint Francis that were made for the back of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">a large and magnificent double-sided altarpiece</a> painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassetta</a> for the high altar of San Francesco at Borgo San Sepolcro. The back showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Francis in Glory</span> (Berenson Collection, Villa I Tatti, Settingnano) surrounded by eight scenes of episodes from his life, seven of which are in our collection. The scenes were arranged in pairs: this one was on the bottom row on the left, next to <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis before the Pope: The Granting of the Indulgence of the Portiuncula</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is in many ways a traditional composition: the saint’s pose, the winged seraphim and inclusion of Brother Leo, the figure seated on the ground at the right, are all recognisable from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> of this scene in the Upper Church of at Assisi. There are, however, unusual details. Prominently placed in the middle of the scene is a carefully carved recess containing a bare but bleeding cross, on which is hung a crown of thorns. The perspective of this scene is carefully coordinated with that of its neighbour, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Granting of the Indulgence</span>, and the chapel on the left is a formal echo of the door set in the wall behind the papal throne, as if you could walk from one scene into the other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The positioning of the scene in the cycle is also is surprising. Traditionally, this episode was shown immediately before the saint’s death, as the culmination of his imitation of the life of Christ, but the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scripta</span>, the written instructions given to Sassetta by the friars, put it next to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Granting of the Indulgence</span>. This placing was not accidental. The Portiuncula Indulgence, one of the first  to grant absolution from all sins, was controversial as it had not been confirmed by a papal bull. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> writers vigorously defended it, explaining that instead of a written authorisation, God had granted Francis the stigmata as a visible sign of divine approval.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In around 1220, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis of Assisi</a> was living in Gubbio in Umbria, when a fierce wolf began attacking local livestock. It soon graduated to eating people, and would wait by the city gates and pounce on anyone foolish enough to step outside. No one seemed able to kill it, and the city was in a state of siege when Francis offered to go outside and negotiate with the beast. Although advised against this, he set out with a small band of followers to find the wolf’s lair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On seeing the saint the wolf rushed at him, but Francis made the sign of the cross and spoke severely to it, at which point the wolf lay down at his feet. He rebuked the animal for attacking humans, but promised that, if it stopped terrorising the city, it would be forgiven and cared for. The wolf placed its right paw in the saint’s hand to seal the bargain, and followed him back to Gubbio. The people were astonished to see the saint and the now-tame wolf, but Francis explained their pact, and once again the wolf put its paw in his hand to signify its agreement. The wolf allegedly lived for another two years in the city, being fed by the grateful populace.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the fifth of eight paintings from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">San Sepolcro Altarpiece</a></span>, a large and magnificent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> painted for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> church of Borgo San Sepolcro, and installed on the high altar there in 1444. The back of the altarpiece showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Francis in Glory</span> surrounded by eight scenes from his life (seven are in our collection). This panel was in the top row, to the right of the main panel. Its landscape continues in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis before the Sultan</a></span>, which was originally next to it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a rarely depicted scene, and the only one represented on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HH8-0001-0000-0000.htm">San Sepolcro Altarpiece</a></span> that is not in Francis‘ official biography, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Legenda Maior</span>. Instead, the artist and his advisers followed the account in the late fourteenth-century <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fioretti</span> (’Little Flowers of St Francis‘). <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sassetta</a> has compressed the story somewhat and set it outside the walls of Gubbio. The wolf places its paw in the saint’s hand, watched by a crowd of townsfolk and another friar. To the left a notary writes down their agreement; on the right are the scattered bones and body parts of the wolf’s victims. Women watch from a safe distance, peeping between the battlements of the city gate. The presence of the notary is unexpected, and it was perhaps intended as a compliment to Francesco de’Larghi, the notary who did the paperwork for the altarpiece and oversaw payments for it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">How Sassetta depicted the various stories was affected by contemporary Franciscan doctrines. The wolf, a traditional symbol of avarice, is an allegory for the taming of worldly desires, a particularly important theme in the light of Observant (reformed) tendencies in the Franciscan Order. Francis himself was always shown, as here, with another friar as a companion: from 1336 all friars had to travel in pairs, to keep an eye on each other. The friar here has his hands tucked in his sleeves and his head covered, in accordance with the custom of the Order.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical investigation reveals that changes were made during the execution of this painting. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has shown an incised perspective grid in the lower part of the painting, which seems to bear no relation to the scene as painted. This may suggest that a different composition was originally planned. The flight of birds was originally incised as a straight line, but eventually painted as a graceful curve.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the earliest pictures in the  National Gallery and its largest painted crucifix. Few paintings of this kind survive but they were common feature of church interiors in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Italy.  They were placed on or above an altar or hung from the high screen that separated the choir from the rest of the church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Its large size and shape meant that it would have been visible and instantly recognisable from a distance. At first sight, a viewer would notice the green tinge of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s flesh and the graceful way in which his lifeless body hangs limply on the Cross; his arms are bowed,his head is slumped over his chest and his legs droop to one side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Nearer they would see the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John</a>, who was called the ‘beloved disciple’, depicted at either end of the arms of the crucifix. Both were present at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. Their figures are cropped to bust-length focusing attention on their sorrowful gazes and gestures as they mourn the dead Christ. The Virgin holds her veil up to her face as though to wipe away a tear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At this point a worshipper would be confronted with the sight of Christ’s blood dripping from the wounds in his hands and feet, where he has been nailed to the Cross, and spraying from the wound in his side. Although the image was hung quite high, they may also have seen that Christ wears a transparent loin cloth and that his mouth droops at the corners, the muscles slack and lifeless.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The inscription at the top of the Cross reads: IHS NAZARENUS, REX IUDEORUM (‘Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews’). Its presence here was perhaps supposed to make this painted Cross appear more like the one described in the Bible: the Gospel of John describes how the Roman governor Pontius Pilate nailed a sign with these words to the Cross. It is possible, however, that there was originally a circular panel with an image of Christ in a blessing gesture placed above it, crowning the entire crucifix.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A radical shift in how Christ was depicted took place in Italian painting from the mid-thirteenth century; this work is an example of that change. Up until this point Christ would have appeared on such painted crucifixes in an upright posture, looking directly at the viewers in a pose called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christus Triumphans</span> (‘Christ Triumphant’). The panel behind him – decorated with a repeated geometrical pattern – and those panels depicting the Virgin and Saint John would have displayed the events leading up to the Crucifixion. Here, by contrast, this boldly decorated backdrop highlights the three-dimensionality of Christ’s weak body; the poignant images of the grief of those closest to Christ invite the viewer to join them in mourning. This encouragement of an emotional response echoes new ideas about spirituality which encouraged empathy with Christ’s suffering in order to experience a closer relationship with him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QGP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Segna di Bonaventura</a> was the nephew of one of the most renowned painters of fourteenth-century Siena, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>. Segna painted this crucifix at around the same time as Duccio created his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD8-0001-0000-0000.htm">triptych depicting the Virgin and Child with saints</a>. Both works share graceful flowing lines and harmonious colour combinations; emotions are expressed through gesture but the overall effect is calm and restrained.</p></div>

There is only the faintest trace of the inscription that identified him – it’s on the left, next to his shoulder.

Technical analysis has revealed that David’s crown is made of gold and silver leaf which have been beaten together to create a duller shade of gold.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The crown indicates his status, as does his cloak, the white lining of which is painted with dark patches to resemble ermine, which was typically worn by royalty.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel is one of four in our collection that come from the lowest part of an altarpiece (the predella) made for the church of Santa Croce in Florence. It shows the moment, described in the Gospels, when Jesus Christ was arrested by Roman soldiers. The soldiers are on the right in elaborate armour; their helmets were originally silver but the silver leaf has darkened over time. They were accompanied by chief priests from the Jewish Temple – the bearded men on the left of the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arrest was organised by Christ’s disciple Judas. We see him in the centre of the scene, kissing Jesus on the cheek – a prearranged signal for the authorities: ‘The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard’ (Mark 14: 44–45). As this is happening, Jesus raises his hand to rebuke Saint Peter, as he sees him assaulting one of the men.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q76-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ugolino</a>’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HU9-0001-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece for the church of Santa Croce</a> in Florence. The predella ran along the bottom of the entire altarpiece and was, as was usual, originally painted on one horizontal panel. It was then cut into individual scenes. There are three other scenes in our collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKT-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Way to Calvary</a></span>, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRP-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Deposition</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5E-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Resurrection</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was the second scene on the predella, positioned between images of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Last Supper</span> (Lehman Collection, Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Flagellation</span> (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin). It shows the moment, described in the Gospels, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> was arrested by Roman soldiers. The soldiers appear on the right-hand side in elaborate armour; their helmets were originally silver but the silver leaf has darkened over time. They carry lanterns and spears – Ugolino has taken this small detail from the Gospel account (John 18: 3) – and are accompanied by chief priests from the Jewish Temple (the bearded men on the left). Before the painting entered our collection, the soldiers‘ eyes were damaged – most probably deliberately.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arrest was organised by Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciple</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a>. We see him in the centre of the scene, kissing Christ on the cheek – a prearranged signal for the authorities: ’The one I shall kiss is the man; seize him and lead him away under guard‘ (Mark 14: 44–45). As this is happening, Christ raises his hand to rebuke Peter, who is assaulting one of the men present. According to the Gospels, Christ told Peter to put his weapon away – he knew that human force was no longer necessary and that he would have to suffer death according to the will of God: ’shall I not drink the cup which the Father has given me?’ (John 18: 11).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s response to Peter’s aggression emphasises his acceptance of his fate and the contrast between his accusers' violence and his own peaceful attitude. The predella as a whole narrated Christ’s torture and death, known as the Passion. This was suitable for the altarpiece, as it focused on Christ’s ultimate conquest of death through the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ugolino has based the design of this image closely on a scene of the same subject by his Sienese contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio</a>, who included it in the scenes on the back of his famous altarpiece known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HKS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Maestà</a>. The main difference is that Ugolino has used fewer figures.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel comes from the altarpiece Ugolino made for the church of Santa Croce in Florence – it was in the predella (’step', the lowest part of an altarpiece). Three other panels from this predella are in the National Gallery’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dead Christ is being removed from the Cross. One man removes the nails from Christ’s feet; blood from his wounds has pooled on the ground below. He may be Nicodemus, who is mentioned in John’s Gospel as having come to the Cross with spices to anoint Christ’s body.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man on the ladder is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who removed Christ from the Cross, according to Luke’s Gospel. Christ’s limp body is caught by his mother, the Virgin Mary, who embraces him, placing her face against his. Mary Magdalene caresses Christ’s hand, pressing it against her cheek. Saint John the Evangelist is equally mournful, clutching the body closely.</p></div>

This may be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nicodemus</a>, a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pharisee</a> who is mentioned in the Gospel of John as having come to the Cross with spices to anoint Christ’s body. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EC7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, a man from the town of Arimathea, appears in both Luke’s and John’s Gospels; according to Luke, he removed the body from the Cross alone. It is likely, then, that the man on the ladder is Joseph of Arimathea.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s limp body collapses as he is gradually freed from the Cross, and he is caught by his mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. She embraces him, placing her face against his in a tender gesture that reminds the viewer of their relationship. The Virgin is accompanied by three other women. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> caresses Christ’s hand, pressing it against her cheek. A woman in green behind is only barely visible. Technical analysis has shown that her head – which can be seen between the haloes of Mary Magdalene and Christ – is painted over the gilded background. This implies that she was added at a late stage of the painting process, over the gilding: usually the artist would reserve a space for the painted figures so as not to waste precious gold leaf. The place where Jesus was crucified was known as Golgotha (‘the place of the skull’). The absence of trees and the arid, craggy rocks seem a fitting landscape for a place with such a bleak name.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, and in the other predella panels, Ugolino used panels from an altarpiece known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Maestà</span>, made by his Sienese predecessor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Duccio</a>, as a model for the composition – though he includes fewer figures. Here he has omitted two of the women who appear in Duccio’s depiction of this subject.</p></div>

She is shown, as was traditional, wearing a blue robe. It was painted with ultramarine, an expensive pigment which is bright blue when fresh, but which has a tendency to darken over time, as it has here. The soldiers' helmets have also darkened over time – they were once silver. Mary is accompanied by two other women, probably the female followers of Christ mentioned in the Gospels, both also called Mary.

Ugolino places the figure of Christ further to the right of the picture so that he has to turn back to look towards his mother, increasing the emotion of the moment. The Roman soldiers who arrested Jesus appear, armed with a variety of weapons to push Christ onward; on the other side, a servant pulls him by a rope tied around his neck. We also see the Jewish priests who were present at Christ’s arrest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was the central part of the predella.

The Cross, placed centrally within the design of the panel, would have been situated below the figure of Christ enthroned shown on the central panel. That picture in turn was crowned with an image of the Crucifixion, absent from the predella series. This emphasis on the Cross was appropriate for the church – it was named after the Holy Cross.</p></div>
