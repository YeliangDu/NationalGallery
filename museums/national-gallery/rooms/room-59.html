          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was one of Cima da Conegliano’s most popular designs, and he and his workshop produced a number of versions of it. The Virgin Mary sits on a marble bench in front of a sunlit Italian landscape, her body forming a solid mass which we can almost feel pressing down on the cool stone.

The news arrived on 25 March, the feast of the Annunciation. From then on, the feast was celebrated with a great procession from the town up to the convent of the Observant Friars, for whom this altarpiece was made. The coats of arms along the base of the painting are those of the town, the pope and the bishop, while the inscription, ‘LIBERTAS ECCLESIASTICA’, was the title of the papal bull granting Ascoli its rights.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is unique in showing a local saint effectively intervening in a biblical event. Emidius balances a model of Ascoli, whose towers are still recognisable today, on his knee. Just the other side of the wall we see Mary kneeling in a splendid Renaissance palace, about to be struck by a heavenly bolt of light which will transform her into the mother of God.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around them the town goes on, oblivious. Only a small child peering round the corner of the steps and a young man gazing up at the sky have noticed the flash which carries the dove of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> down from heaven, through a convenient golden hole in the wall and to Mary. The wind of its passing has disturbed the doves, who flutter from their perches, and ruffled the oriental carpet hanging over the wall above Mary’s chamber. A man on the bridge reads a message handed to him by another man, perhaps the news of the papal bull. It has been delivered by the carrier pigeon in the cage beside them – a witty analogy of the Annunciation itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a>’s best-known painting and a masterpiece of decoration and perspective. He’s combined classical architecture and Renaissance ornament with an interest in the depiction of everyday objects, similar to Netherlandish painting. Most of Crivelli’s altarpieces were <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptychs</a>  with gold backgrounds, but this is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pala</a></span>, an altarpiece with a single, unified surface. This format allowed Crivelli to show both his mastery of linear perspective and his gift for descriptive detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The vanishing point is, unusually, located to the left rather than in the centre of the composition, so that Crivelli can put a close-up of the inside of Mary’s house next to a view down the narrow street beside it. Like many artists, Crivelli used ideas from other painters. Italian artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> were experimenting with radical perspective from the 1450s, and Crivelli probably took the idea for the composition of Gabriel in the street and the Virgin in her house from Giovanni Angelo d'Antonio’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Annunciation</span>, made for the main church in Camerino in about 1455. But he’s transformed his model completely, so that the angel, the saint and the Virgin appear almost as if they were ordinary people going about their daily business. Objects and people cast shadows – the peacock, the fluttering carpets, even Emidius himself – adding to our sense of looking into a real space. In the background people chat, a maid balances a pot on her head and spins wool on a distaff, while mortar drips down a recently repaired wall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary’s room is full of beautifully observed household objects which give the painting a non-religious feel. The books piled on the shelf above her bed are rotated at different angles to show off Crivelli’s trademark skill at foreshortening, while the candle and vase cast distinct shadows on the wooden panelling. Mary kneels at a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">prie-dieu</span> (a prayer desk) and reads from a book whose pages flutter in the breeze – she was thought to have been reading Isaiah’s prophecy of the birth of the Messiah at the moment of Gabriel’s arrival.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary herself is a fashionable fifteenth-century lady. She wears a tight bodice embroidered with gold flowers and foliage, and her linen underdress emerges in puffs from her slashed sleeves. Her head is bare, aside from a jewelled coronet, a reminder that she is both a virgin and Queen of Heaven: only unmarried girls and royalty had uncovered hair. Many of the details dotted around the painting had symbolic meaning at the time. The goldfinch in its cage and the peacock perched were symbols respectively of Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>, while the lily Gabriel holds refers to Mary’s chastity and spiritual purity. Even the glass vase was a metaphor for the mystery of Christ’s conception, as light passes through glass without fracturing it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as commemorating their political and financial autonomy, the altarpiece was also an appeal for divine aid. The model city held by Emidius recalls miniature cities offered by communes in the Marche at the important shrine of the Virgin at Loreto, on the Adriatic coast north of Ascoli. From 1484 Ascoli was devastated by a plague so severe that the Annunciation Day procession had to be cancelled and many of the citizens fled. It also plunged into a war with its long-standing rival, the city of Fermo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see Crivelli’s signature and the date on the pilasters by the doorway into the Virgin’s house, while fruit – his trademark – balances precariously on the marble shelf at the bottom. Crivelli loved playing games with his viewers, suggesting that his paintings were both flat and three-dimensional.

Two sad, child-like angels hold up Jesus’s lifeless body, one nestling his head sorrowfully against Christ’s shoulder. Their pink cheeks and chubby arms and legs form a vivid contrast to Jesus’s gaunt and greying face. His eyes are shut and his head hangs down, while his fingers contract in rigor mortis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a> has paid an almost morbid attention to the details of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s body and the wounds inflicted at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>. The long thorns of his crown are thrust under the flesh of his forehead; holes from the nails that fixed him to the cross gape in the backs of his hands; blood trickles down the wound in his side. The hairs on his chest and around his nipples, and even the pubic hairs running down into his groin, are individually defined.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This composition, with the body of Christ flanked by grieving angels modelled on classical cherubs (known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a>) was inspired by the Florentine sculptor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a>’s bronze relief of the subject, made for the high altar of Sant’Antonio in Padua, the city where Crivelli trained as a painter. Crivelli was skilled at exploiting the optical effects of different gold surfaces, which must have shone and flickered in the candlelight of a medieval church. Both Christ and the angels have patterns of concentric lines and flowers modelled in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> in their haloes, as well as the arms of the cross in Christ’s. These would have stood out from the flat burnished gold of the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This way of showing Jesus dead but upright was based on a vision of the dead Christ which appeared to Pope Gregory (about 540–604) as he celebrated Mass in the church of Santa Croce in Rome. Gregory was said to have ordered a picture of this vision to be made, which became known as the ‘Imago Pietatis’ (‘image of pity’) or the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows.</a> In the Middle Ages people believed that anyone who prayed before the original image or copies of it would be given an Indulgence – these allowed people to reduce the number of years they spent in purgatory – of 20,000 years. So the Man of Sorrows became one of the most popular ways of depicting Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a> was especially interested in the suffering of Christ at the Crucifixion, as meditation on the pain of the<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Passion</a> was believed to lead to salvation. The physicality of Crivelli’s depiction would have reminded the friars of Christ’s sacrifice, which was commemorated every time <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRM-0008-0000-0000.htm">mass</a> was performed on the altar below. This image would have been at the top of the altarpiece, above a painting of the Virgin and Child. Together they would have represented the beginning and end of the drama of human salvation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli’s signature, ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Carolus Crivellus Venetus pinxit</span>’ (‘Carlo Crivelli the Venetian painted (this)’), is painted as if carved into the stone balustrade. In medieval Franciscan churches, the high altar was usually raised up on a dais at the east end. It was physically and visually separated from the nave by the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tramezzo</span> screen, known as a rood screen in England, which divided the public end of the church from the stalls where the friars sat. Selling paintings was a competitive business, however, and large altarpieces like this were an important way of promoting a painter’s work. By putting his signature at the top, rather than under the Virgin and Child, Crivelli was ensuring it was visible to the widest possible public.</p></div>

The hairs on his chest and around his nipples, and even the pubic hairs running down into his groin, are individually defined.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This composition, with the body of Christ flanked by grieving angels modelled on classical cherubs (known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a>) was inspired by the Florentine sculptor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a>’s bronze relief of the subject, made for the high altar of Sant’Antonio in Padua, the city where Crivelli trained as a painter. Crivelli was skilled at exploiting the optical effects of different gold surfaces, which must have shone and flickered in the candlelight of a medieval church. Both Christ and the angels have patterns of concentric lines and flowers modelled in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> in their haloes, as well as the arms of the cross in Christ’s. These would have stood out from the flat burnished gold of the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This way of showing Jesus dead but upright was based on a vision of the dead Christ which appeared to Pope Gregory (about 540–604) as he celebrated Mass in the church of Santa Croce in Rome. Gregory was said to have ordered a picture of this vision to be made, which became known as the ‘Imago Pietatis’ (‘image of pity’) or the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows.</a> In the Middle Ages people believed that anyone who prayed before the original image or copies of it would be given an Indulgence – these allowed people to reduce the number of years they spent in purgatory – of 20,000 years. So the Man of Sorrows became one of the most popular ways of depicting Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a> was especially interested in the suffering of Christ at the Crucifixion, as meditation on the pain of the<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Passion</a> was believed to lead to salvation. The physicality of Crivelli’s depiction would have reminded the friars of Christ’s sacrifice, which was commemorated every time <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRM-0008-0000-0000.htm">mass</a> was performed on the altar below. This image would have been at the top of the altarpiece, above a painting of the Virgin and Child. Together they would have represented the beginning and end of the drama of human salvation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli’s signature, ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Carolus Crivellus Venetus pinxit</span>’ (‘Carlo Crivelli the Venetian painted (this)’), is painted as if carved into the stone balustrade. In medieval Franciscan churches, the high altar was usually raised up on a dais at the east end. It was physically and visually separated from the nave by the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tramezzo</span> screen, known as a rood screen in England, which divided the public end of the church from the stalls where the friars sat. Selling paintings was a competitive business, however, and large altarpieces like this were an important way of promoting a painter’s work. By putting his signature at the top, rather than under the Virgin and Child, Crivelli was ensuring it was visible to the widest possible public.</p></div>

Overwhelmed by shame he retreated to the Syrian desert to live a life of poverty and self-denial. To punish himself for sinful thoughts, he would – as we see here – beat his body until it bled. He wrote: ‘Wherever I found a deep valley or rough mountainside or rocky precipice, I made it my place of prayer and of torture for my unhappy flesh.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, Saint Jerome originally looked towards a vision of Christ, arms outstretched on a cross made of beams of light. This was cut out in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth century, before the picture was purchased by the National Gallery, and is now in the Brera, Milan. The saint’s emaciated body mirrors that of the crucified Christ, emphasising that, through his suffering, he has become like Christ. Veins protrude from his lean arms, and the outline of his ribcage creates a jagged V-shape where it meets his sharp hip bone. The bony outlines of his body are matched by the implausible folds of his green drapery, which appears to have an energy of its own.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting may have been commissioned as inspiration for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a> whose members, like Saint Jerome, practised self-flagellation with the aim of bringing themselves closer to Christ through imitation of his sufferings.

He kneels beside a man in a red tunic, probably the panel’s patron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome’s writings mention he lived in a ‘cell’, often depicted as a cave. Here, instead of a cave, he is framed by the hollow trunk of an ancient tree with lumpy roots and thick bark. This could be a visual reference to the writings of the Bishop of Ferrara, Giovanni Tavelli (1386–1446) who also practised self-flagellation. Tavelli frequently encouraged his fellow clerics to be ‘fortified with oak’ – strengthened in their role as advocates of Christ. The lion on the left is one of the saint’s attributes; according to legend, Jerome befriended a lion by pulling a thorn out of its paw. The wallcreeper and the owl may symbolise evil – the owl’s nocturnal habits were sometimes associated with sin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tura’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> is visible beneath the paint surface. He used multiple parallel strokes of dark paint to indicate areas in shadow, which he further emphasised with a monochrome wash (as shown by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectograms</a>). This technique was used by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> and in sixteenth-century painting, but it is relatively rare in fifteenth-century Italian painting. In this period, it is found in works by northern European artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> (whom we know had an impact on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tura’s technique</a>). X-ray photographs show that Tura also used fine lines of white paint to highlight areas of the drawing. Like the use of the wash, this technique is more common in drawings on paper than in the underdrawing of a painting; it shows how carefully Tura worked out the composition before he began to paint.</p></div>

The bony outlines of his body are matched by the implausible folds of his green drapery, which appears to have an energy of its own.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting may have been commissioned as inspiration for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a> whose members, like Saint Jerome, practised self-flagellation with the aim of bringing themselves closer to Christ through imitation of his sufferings. They may have been <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> as that order’s founder, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis</a>, is visible in the background. He kneels beside a man in a red tunic, probably the panel’s patron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome’s writings mention he lived in a ‘cell’, often depicted as a cave. Here, instead of a cave, he is framed by the hollow trunk of an ancient tree with lumpy roots and thick bark. This could be a visual reference to the writings of the Bishop of Ferrara, Giovanni Tavelli (1386–1446) who also practised self-flagellation. Tavelli frequently encouraged his fellow clerics to be ‘fortified with oak’ – strengthened in their role as advocates of Christ. The lion on the left is one of the saint’s attributes; according to legend, Jerome befriended a lion by pulling a thorn out of its paw. The wallcreeper and the owl may symbolise evil – the owl’s nocturnal habits were sometimes associated with sin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tura’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> is visible beneath the paint surface. He used multiple parallel strokes of dark paint to indicate areas in shadow, which he further emphasised with a monochrome wash (as shown by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectograms</a>). This technique was used by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> and in sixteenth-century painting, but it is relatively rare in fifteenth-century Italian painting. In this period, it is found in works by northern European artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> (whom we know had an impact on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tura’s technique</a>). X-ray photographs show that Tura also used fine lines of white paint to highlight areas of the drawing. Like the use of the wash, this technique is more common in drawings on paper than in the underdrawing of a painting; it shows how carefully Tura worked out the composition before he began to paint.</p></div>

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the central panel of an extraordinary altarpiece commissioned by the Roverella family for the church of San Giorgio in Ferrara. Looking up, worshippers would have been transported to the realm of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, saints and angels. The bright, solid architecture and throne make it feel like we’re looking at a three-dimensional space. We‘re encouraged to imagine the sound of heavenly music – angels play stringed instruments and a miniature organ with swirling pipes (the front once bore an inscription, only a trace of which remains).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin, wearing a crown rather than a halo, sits on a high marble throne with a curved back, the naked Christ Child asleep in her lap. The sharp folds of her blue robe make her look like a sculpture in a niche. An oversized scallop shell, like that in Tura’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G25-0001-0000-0000.htm">painting of a muse</a>, shelters her head. Little carvings of cherubs, painted to imitate gilded bronze, appear to hold it up with ribbons. Symbols of the four authors of the Gospels – an eagle, winged lion, winged bull and reading man – crown the throne, while the stone tablets to either side of the Virgin, carved with the Ten Commandments in Hebrew text, evoke the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3K-0008-0000-0000.htm">Old Testament</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">San Giorgio was once the city’s cathedral, but by the fifteenth century it had become the church of the order of monks known as the Olivetans. The altarpiece was a family project to commemorate Lorenzo Roverella, who had been Bishop of Ferrara from 1460 until his death in 1474. In 1476 his brother Niccolo Roverella (who was a prior of the church) and Lorenzo’s heirs gained permission to use the chancel chapel – the location of the high altar – for Lorenzo’s tomb and an altarpiece in his honour. As a result, various members of the Roverella family made wills to provide for the project; Nicolo’s nephew, Filiasio, the Archbishop of Ravenna, arranged for an annual donation of 200 ducats towards it. In 1487 it was installed on the high altar in the chancel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This part of the church was remodelled in the early 1580s. It’s likely that the altarpiece was moved to a side altar at about this time, where it was seen by Girolamo Barrufaldi in 1706. His description allows us to imagine its original appearance. Our panel was flanked by two side panels and crowned with a lunette (a semi-circular panel) which shows the lamentation of Christ’s dead body (Louvre, Paris) – a stark contrast to the lively and colourful central image. The right-hand panel (Colonna Collection, Rome) shows a kneeling cleric presented to the Virgin and Child by Saints Paul and Maurelius. Only a fragment of the left-hand panel, which shows the head of Saint George, survives, but we know from another account by Barrufaldi, written in 1709, that he, along with Saint Peter, were depicted presenting another kneeling cleric. These side panels were each topped with another panel, one of the Blessed Bernard Tolomei, founder of the Olivetan Order, and the other of Saint Benedict.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Barrufaldi’s 1709 account went on to suggest that the kneeling figure on the left side panel was in fact Lorenzo, and that he was depicted knocking on a door, presumably to gain entry to the court of the Virgin. Barrufaldi interpreted the inscription on the organ at the base of the throne with two lines from a poem by a Ferrarese poet, which seem to exhort the angel to let him in: ‘Arise boy, the Roverella family are knocking outside. Let entry be given unto them. The Law says "knock, you shall be admitted".’ Barrufaldi based his identification of Lorenzo on the sculpture of him on his tomb, made by Ambrogio da Milano and Antonio Rosselino. Since only a fragment of this panel survives, we cannot be certain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Barrufaldi suggested that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> showed scenes of the lives of Bernard and Benedict, though so far none have been identified.  Three round panels (called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tondi</span>) – which show the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQK-0008-0000-0000.htm">circumcision of Christ</a> (Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston), the Adoration of the Magi (Fogg Art Museum, Boston) and the Flight into Egypt (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) – have also been associated with the altarpiece’s predella.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the arguments in favour of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tondi</span> having been part of the predella relates to the theological message of the whole ensemble and relies upon the circumcision panel being at the predella’s centre. As a worshipper raised their eyes upwards from this panel, they would be confronted with the image of the sleeping infant Christ and, once their gaze reached the very top, the sight of the dead Christ in the lunette. The blood Christ shed at his circumcision and the image of his sleeping naked body as a baby foreshadowed his suffering and death, mourned in the upper panel. However, this association is doubtful: the woodgrain of these panels runs vertically and predella panels were usually painted on a single horizontal plank, and the pigments used do not fit with the bold, bright colours of the main panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is some suggestion that the altarpiece expresses antagonism towards the Jews of Ferrara, because although Tura included the second commandment in the Hebrew text he covered it with Christ’s head. Christian-Jewish relations were indeed fragile in this period, but the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">d‘Este family</a>, with whom the Roverella were closely connected, protected the Jews of their community. It seems unlikely that the Roverella who, by hiring Tura, were seeking to reinforce their ties with the d’Este and buy into the prestige of the court, would engage in such an undiplomatic association. The second commandment forbids the creation of images of God, and Tura might simply have been tempted to cover it up because his livelihood as an artist depended on doing just that.</p></div>
