Brancaleoni commissioned Barrocci to paint a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rest on the Return from Egypt</span> (Vatican Museums, Vatican City) for the parish church at Piobbico at about the same time, but  the smaller scale, square shape and domestic subject of ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Madonna del Gatto</span>’ (‘Madonna of the Cat’) suggest it was intended for Brancaleoni’s household. Given the allusions to feminine domesticity it may have been meant for the countess’s apartments, the decoration of which was finished in 1574 (the decoration of the count’s apartments was not completed until 1585). We know that <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Madonna del Gatto</span> passed down the female line of the family, having been inherited by the countess’s daughter Isabella, again suggesting that the painting was associated with the Brancaleoni women.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cat is a relatively unusual motif in representations of the holy family.

The caption to Cornelis Cort’s 1577 engraving of the picture explains that this is the moment when the Christ Child becomes aware of humanity’s expulsion from paradise, thus understanding his future role as redeemer. The Brancaleoni coat of arms consists of a lion rampant surmounted by a recumbent cross, and this appears throughout the decoration of their palace. The cat and John the Baptist’s cross in the picture may be a pun on the family’s heraldry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Indicative of Barocci’s meticulous approach, no less than around 35 preparatory drawings survive for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Madonna del Gatto</span>, including a full-size cartoon (private collection, France).

The Baptist was the patron saint of Florence and images of the Virgin and Child with Saint John seem to have been especially popular there. The charming detail of an artist and his assistants painting a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> above the city gate was repeated in Giuliano Bugiardini’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rape of Dinah</span> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was probably commissioned by Alamanno Salviati (1459–1510) for his son Averardo (1489–1553) as it is mentioned in 1509 in the account book of the San Marco convent in Florence, where Fra Bartolommeo lived and worked. Payment for the picture went to both Fra Bartolommeo and Mariotto Albertinelli (1474–1515), as they were working in partnership at the time, however the technique, handling and colouring all suggest that it was painted by Fra Bartolommeo himself between 1508 and 1510.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is related to Fra Bartolommeo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family</span> (Borghese Gallery, Rome) of about 1495, while the unusual pose of the Virgin, with her hands crossed over her chest, is a motif derived from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>, and a variation of Fra Bartolommeo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family</span> (Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan), probably dating from around 1504. However, his approach to composition and colouring here is influenced by his visit to Venice in the spring of 1508; the abundant landscape, small background figures going about their daily business and the interest in the rendering of light suggest that Fra Bartolommeo knew the work of Venetian painters, especially <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The veiled, chaste gentleness of mood and the softened forms are typical of Fra Bartolommeo, while the subtle chiaroscuro reveals the impact of Leonardo’s painting technique. The monumental form of Saint Joseph reflects the influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>, but it seems that his facial features are those of Fra Bartolommeo himself, as we know his appearance from a drawing in Munich.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two sheets of drawings for the Virgin, a forceful black chalk study for Saint Joseph and two studies for the Christ Child in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam. Fra Bartolommeo did not tend to improvise during painting but to work from a full-size cartoon which was transferred to the gesso-primed surface of the canvas or panel by stylus tracing or incision. However, here he made a number of significant changes freehand, particularly in the positioning of Christ’s limbs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Judging by the number of contemporary and later copies, Fra Bartolommeo’s composition soon became popular. The version closest to the National Gallery’s painting is a panel of almost the same size in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo, Brescia.</p></div>

However, his approach to composition and colouring here is influenced by his visit to Venice in the spring of 1508; the abundant landscape, small background figures going about their daily business and the interest in the rendering of light suggest that Fra Bartolommeo knew the work of Venetian painters, especially <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The veiled, chaste gentleness of mood and the softened forms are typical of Fra Bartolommeo, while the subtle chiaroscuro reveals the impact of Leonardo’s painting technique. The monumental form of Saint Joseph reflects the influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>, but it seems that his facial features are those of Fra Bartolommeo himself, as we know his appearance from a drawing in Munich.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two sheets of drawings for the Virgin, a forceful black chalk study for Saint Joseph and two studies for the Christ Child in the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam. Fra Bartolommeo did not tend to improvise during painting but to work from a full-size cartoon which was transferred to the gesso-primed surface of the canvas or panel by stylus tracing or incision. However, here he made a number of significant changes freehand, particularly in the positioning of Christ’s limbs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Judging by the number of contemporary and later copies, Fra Bartolommeo’s composition soon became popular. The version closest to the National Gallery’s painting is a panel of almost the same size in the Pinacoteca Tosio Martinengo, Brescia.</p></div>

They may have been framed together, forming part of the top of the backboard of a bench seat. Marcia, depicted here, is painted on cherry wood, which suggests that the bench seat was an especially high quality and expensive item in the bedchamber.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The heroines stand in ethereal dawn-lit landscapes and are surrounded by antique architectural fragments.

At the feet of each is a stone tablet inscribed with an identifying Latin couplet written in the first person. Though they do not look directly at the viewer, the women appear to speak, with parted lips and expressive gestures. Tanaquil points to herself and to the explanatory couplet, which translates as: ‘I am Tanaquil. In my prescience I created two kings, first my husband, then my slave.’ Tanaquil promoted her slave Servus Tullius as the next king after her husband’s death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Learned Cornelia is reading a book, expressing her identity as a cultured and refined woman and an example of maternal dedication.

Servius Tullius was later given the throne by popular support.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting Tanaquil is depicted as a virtuous bride and wife, holding a spindle or distaff celebrating her domestic ability as a gifted spinner of wool. Tanaquil’s two premonitions of an eagle and flames may also relate to the Petrucci coat of arms, which features an eagle and a flame-like zigzag between the blue and gold background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marcia</a>, in the National Gallery’s other panel, personified the virtues of marital fidelity and wifely obedience as well as fruitful maternity.</p></div>

It was more common in paintings at this time for the disciples to be shown as pilgrims, with Christ wearing his usual robes so he could be recognised easily. The three figures are shown again in the middle distance with Christ in the centre and the others taking his arms, walking towards a fortified hilltop village, typical of Lombardy where this picture was painted. The older disciple is probably intended to be Cleopas or Clopas, while the younger one could be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Luke</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s hands are marked with the wounds where he was nailed to the Cross but his pilgrim disguise explains why the disciples do not immediately recognise him. The scallop shell on Christ’s hat is a token usually worn by those who have made a pilgrimage to Santiagio de Compostella in Spain, and the gold pin is in the shape of a pilgrim’s staff.

In 1516 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfonso I d‘Este, Duke of Ferrara</a>, became patron of the church and in 1520 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Garofalo</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Resurrection</span> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) was painted for the altar to the right of the high altar.

By the end of the fifteenth century he had become one of the most venerated saints in Christendom, chiefly as a protector against the plague. He is usually shown, as here, tied to a tree and pierced by the arrows which miraculously failed to kill him. Ortolano has depicted the musculature of Sebastian’s arms and left leg, revealing the position of veins below the knee, with great anatomical accuracy. The crossbow and wolf-fur quiver of arrows discarded on the ground are also observed and recorded with incredible realism. The device with the toothed bar and handle leaning against the crossbow is a type of crank used to draw back the crossbow string. It would be removed before the arrow was fired.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Roch</a> (on the left), was born in Montpellier, France, in the fourteenth century and travelled to Italy as a pilgrim, where he contracted the plague. In paintings he is generally shown revealing a plague sore on his thigh, but here the sore is discreetly concealed by shadow. Ortolano has omitted the helpful dog who usually accompanies Saint Roch in paintings, but included a startlingly realistic wicker-covered glass flask and sack at his feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Demetrius (on the right) is rare in Italian art. The fact that his name has been written on a paper at his feet suggests that no one at the time was expected to recognise him. Proconsul on the Greek island of Thessalonica, he was martyred by being run through with spears shortly before AD 305. He is always depicted as a warrior holding a sword and frequently a shield – his red cloak symbolises his martyrdom. Here, he is wearing full plate armour, the reflections in its polished surface observed and depicted in incredible detail. His gesture – thoughtfully resting his face on his hand – must have been suggested by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael’</a>s Saint Paul in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Cecilia Altarpiece</span>, sent from Rome to Bologna in 1516 (now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna). However, Ortolano’s decision to cover Saint Demetrius' mouth is very unusual, as is his choice of giving him a beard. The meticulously observed still life of objects on the ground in Ortolano’s painting was certainly influenced by the musical instruments similarly placed on the ground in Raphael’s painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ortolano’s altarpiece may once have had a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5X-0008-0000-0000.htm">lunette</a> above it depicting the Risen Christ, which might explain why both Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch are looking upward.</p></div>

It would be removed before the arrow was fired.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Roch</a> (on the left), was born in Montpellier, France, in the fourteenth century and travelled to Italy as a pilgrim, where he contracted the plague. In paintings he is generally shown revealing a plague sore on his thigh, but here the sore is discreetly concealed by shadow. Ortolano has omitted the helpful dog who usually accompanies Saint Roch in paintings, but included a startlingly realistic wicker-covered glass flask and sack at his feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Demetrius (on the right) is rare in Italian art. The fact that his name has been written on a paper at his feet suggests that no one at the time was expected to recognise him. Proconsul on the Greek island of Thessalonica, he was martyred by being run through with spears shortly before AD 305. He is always depicted as a warrior holding a sword and frequently a shield – his red cloak symbolises his martyrdom. Here, he is wearing full plate armour, the reflections in its polished surface observed and depicted in incredible detail. His gesture – thoughtfully resting his face on his hand – must have been suggested by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael’</a>s Saint Paul in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Cecilia Altarpiece</span>, sent from Rome to Bologna in 1516 (now in the Pinacoteca Nazionale, Bologna). However, Ortolano’s decision to cover Saint Demetrius' mouth is very unusual, as is his choice of giving him a beard. The meticulously observed still life of objects on the ground in Ortolano’s painting was certainly influenced by the musical instruments similarly placed on the ground in Raphael’s painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ortolano’s altarpiece may once have had a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5X-0008-0000-0000.htm">lunette</a> above it depicting the Risen Christ, which might explain why both Saint Sebastian and Saint Roch are looking upward.</p></div>
