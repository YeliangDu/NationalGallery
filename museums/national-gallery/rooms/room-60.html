He was converted to Christianity by the Bishop of Florence, Theodorus, when he was 18 years old. He broke off his marriage engagement and was baptised.

The action is set in the streets of Florence and the architecture would have been largely familiar to contemporary viewers. Botticelli has beautified and idealised his home city, however, and the streets appear cleaner and wider than they actually were. Some of the buildings are imagined or at least more elaborate and richly decorated than the real thing.  He has created a sense of depth by showing a view down a side street towards the hills outside the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the first scene on the far left of the panel, Zenobius, wearing a pink robe, appears twice. First he is talking to a group of women and then sadly but resolutely waking away. Middle-aged women in white headdresses surround a young bare-headed woman in a blue dress and green cloak. This young woman, bowing her head sadly, is Zenobius’s fiancée, whom he has rejected in favour of a life in the service of God. His dainty feet in soft leather boots mirror each other in both poses, emphasising the about-turn of his decision. He crosses the road and is next seen kneeling, wearing only a loincloth, before a large classical-style urn of water. Saint Theodorus is shown baptising him, surrounded by young men in religious vestments, perhaps ordinands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central scene shows Zenobius’s mother, Sophia, being baptised in the covered walkway that surrounds an opulent building with carved and gilded columns. In the final scene Zenobius, who is shown kneeling, has matured – he now has short hair and a beard. Botticelli has omitted a number of scenes from the saint’s early life and instead concludes this panel with his ordination as Bishop of Florence by Pope Damasus.</p></div>

In the central scene Zenobius restores a child to life as he lies on the lap of his wailing mother. The final episode shows Zenobius curing a blind beggar, placing his fingers over his eyelids. The architectural backdrop would have been familiar to Florentine locals: the large archway is probably the Volta di San Pietro, which still exists.

The first two panels in the series are in the National Gallery’s collection. The first,<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DIA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Four Scenes from the Early Life of Saint Zenobius</a></span> shows the saint’s conversion, baptism and ordination as Bishop of Florence. This panel is a continuation of his life story, which had been published by a priest called Clemente Mazza 20 years earlier. It shows three of the saint’s miracles, set in Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The miracle on the left shows Saint Zenobius curing two young men who have been cursed by their mother for beating her. The curse made them bite themselves and is represented by two demon-like creatures or devils that emerge from their mouths as the saint makes the sign of the Cross over them. Their mother, dressed in green, is shown beside them, her arms covering her face in horror. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a> has used gesture to express the drama of the event; even the demons raise their arms in distress. According to Mazza, the woman had brought the boys to the church of San Salvator to pray for their healing. Saint Zenobius had prayed for a long time before a Crucifix, show here within the single arcade that Botticelli has used to stand in for the church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central scene is set before a large brick palace, its door and windows bordered with the grey stone, called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pietra serena</span>, used in much fifteenth-century Florentine architecture. The scene is the first of several in the series that show the saint reviving a person from death. Here, a woman holds her dead son on her lap, wailing dramatically; the boy had been in Zenobius’s care while she was in Rome. The saint restores him to life, as young men in clerical robes – who appeared in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DIA-0001-0000-0000.htm">first panel of the series</a> – and several other distressed onlookers run to the scene. The robes of the man in blue swirl behind him – a visual shorthand conveying his speed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mazza’s biography described Zenobius meeting the French woman and her dead son as he walked in procession from the the church of San Pier Maggiore into the square. Botticelli has faithfully set this scene in the square, the Piazza di San Pier Maggiore: the deep arch with a view into a square beyond is probably the Volta di San Pietro (the archway of Saint Peter) which still exists in modern-day Florence. The church of San Pier Maggiore was, according to legend, founded by Zenobius in the fifth century and it remained, in the fifteenth-century, one of the oldest and most respected churches in Florence. The church itself is indicated by the grey stone doorway at right angles to the archway. We can imagine the saint walking from that door, down the steps and into the square where he encountered the grieving mother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The final scene takes place on the steps in front of the church in the corner of the square. According to Mazza, Zenobius came across a blind man who sat outside the church door every day begging. While Mazza does not name the church, Botticelli sets the event outside the church of San Pier Maggiore in order to include it in the same geographical space as the other miracles. We can tell the man is a beggar: he has a makeshift bag made of a piece of cloth tied around a stick, which lies on the ground beside him next to his small dog. Zenobius, surrounded again by young ordinands in white vestments, heals the man, placing his fingers over his eyes.</p></div>

          <div class="lang lang-local"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This large painting originally stood on an altar in San Pancrazio, an important medieval church dedicated to Saint Pancras in the centre of Florence. This church belonged to the Vallombrosans, an order of reformed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictines</a> founded by the nobleman Giovanni Gualberto in the early eleventh century. Among the Florentine families who owned chapels in San Pancrazio, the Rucellai were the most distinguished. They not only held the patronage rights over the high altar, but also commissioned a funerary chapel in imitation of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem from the celebrated architect and humanist Leon Battista Alberti.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> came from the chapel originally adjacent to the Rucellai Sepulchre, a space now completely altered as a result of renovation works in the eighteenth century and the suppression of the church under Napoleon in the early nineteenth century. Except for the Rucellai Sepulchre, none of the works made for San Pancrazio are still preserved in the church (which is now used as a museum for the twentieth-century sculptor Marino Marini).

          <div class="lang lang-en"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This large painting originally stood on an altar in San Pancrazio, an important medieval church dedicated to Saint Pancras in the centre of Florence. This church belonged to the Vallombrosans, an order of reformed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictines</a> founded by the nobleman Giovanni Gualberto in the early eleventh century. Among the Florentine families who owned chapels in San Pancrazio, the Rucellai were the most distinguished. They not only held the patronage rights over the high altar, but also commissioned a funerary chapel in imitation of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem from the celebrated architect and humanist Leon Battista Alberti.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> came from the chapel originally adjacent to the Rucellai Sepulchre, a space now completely altered as a result of renovation works in the eighteenth century and the suppression of the church under Napoleon in the early nineteenth century. Except for the Rucellai Sepulchre, none of the works made for San Pancrazio are still preserved in the church (which is now used as a museum for the twentieth-century sculptor Marino Marini).

The enclosed garden (or ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">hortus conclusus</span>’ in Latin) was a symbol of Mary’s virginity; it is found in many images of her, such as Benozzo Gozzoli’s little picture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CYU-0001-0000-0000.htm">the Virgin and Child enthroned with angels</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>, when Mary found out that she would conceive a son, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>.

As Gabriel speaks, a small dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost, flies towards Mary’s belly: this is the moment of Christ’s conception. It has been sent by God, whose hand we see appearing from a deep blue cloud that represents the heavens. A golden light emanates from a gap in Mary’s pink dress and she bows her head towards it, in acceptance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> palace in Florence, where it most probably hung above a door. It was made as a pair, and the other panel, which shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HMT-0001-0000-0000.htm">seven Medici patron saints</a>, is also in our collection. The Annunciation was an appropriate scene for a domestic setting: according to the accounts in the Gospels, the angel appeared when Mary was at home. Although she was not wealthy, Lippi has furnished Mary’s house with elegant and rich furnishings to match the palatial setting. The bed behind her resembles contemporary Florentine furniture, and it is draped with a fabric that is embroidered with gold thread. Her chair, too, is draped with a golden damask fabric, like a throne – an indication of her role as Queen of Heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The marble walls are soft shades of apricot and pink, and the carving is in the classical style which was popular in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Florence. Below the vase, an emblem used by the Medici family is carved into the wall: two feathers encircled by a diamond ring. The immense detail with which Lippi has painted Gabriel’s wings probably reflects the fact that peacock wings were also a Medici symbol in this period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Annunciation was an extremely popular subject in Florence. Like in many Italian cities, its feast, celebrated on 25 March, marked the first day of the calendar year.

The enclosed garden (or ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">hortus conclusus</span>’ in Latin) was a symbol of Mary’s virginity; it is found in many images of her, such as Benozzo Gozzoli’s little picture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CYU-0001-0000-0000.htm">the Virgin and Child enthroned with angels</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>, when Mary found out that she would conceive a son, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jesus Christ</a>, through the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a>, huge peacock-feather wings outstretched behind him, kneels in front of her to tell her the news. As Gabriel speaks, a small dove, the symbol of the Holy Ghost, flies towards Mary’s belly: this is the moment of Christ’s conception. It has been sent by God, whose hand we see appearing from a deep blue cloud that represents the heavens. A golden light emanates from a gap in Mary’s pink dress and she bows her head towards it, in acceptance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> palace in Florence, where it most probably hung above a door. It was made as a pair, and the other panel, which shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HMT-0001-0000-0000.htm">seven Medici patron saints</a>, is also in our collection. The Annunciation was an appropriate scene for a domestic setting: according to the accounts in the Gospels, the angel appeared when Mary was at home. Although she was not wealthy, Lippi has furnished Mary’s house with elegant and rich furnishings to match the palatial setting. The bed behind her resembles contemporary Florentine furniture, and it is draped with a fabric that is embroidered with gold thread. Her chair, too, is draped with a golden damask fabric, like a throne – an indication of her role as Queen of Heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The marble walls are soft shades of apricot and pink, and the carving is in the classical style which was popular in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Florence. Below the vase, an emblem used by the Medici family is carved into the wall: two feathers encircled by a diamond ring. The immense detail with which Lippi has painted Gabriel’s wings probably reflects the fact that peacock wings were also a Medici symbol in this period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Annunciation was an extremely popular subject in Florence. Like in many Italian cities, its feast, celebrated on 25 March, marked the first day of the calendar year. The panel might have hung over the door of the palace’s study – its ceiling was decorated with the signs of the zodiac and, therefore, the months of the year.</p></div>

On Pesellino’s death the altarpiece was described as ‘half finished’ and we're not completely sure which bits were done by which artist. Presumably all the preparatory stages – the design, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and the water-gilding, where gold leaf was applied using an animal glue mixed with water and then burnished – were done by Pesellino. Technical analysis shows that the whole composition was drawn in  great detail before painting began; there’s even a surviving preparatory drawing of God from the Trinity (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg). All Pesellino’s figures were done in the same way, with a thin wash of paint over a strong drawing, and show a good grasp of form and structure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But parts of the Trinity are less convincing, and were perhaps left unfinished when Pesellino died. God’s hands are oddly boneless; Christ’s beard seems to have been added in at a late stage, and his body is painted in a single layer of paint and might not be finished. God’s hands and Christ’s body are blank in the St Petersburg study, but possibly for very different reasons. Pesellino could copy the body – a conventional pose – from an existing image of the Crucifixion, but he might have left the hands until he could do a study from life, mindful of the difficultly of showing hands bearing the weight of the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lippi and his workshop were responsible for things done in the final stages, such as the dots for the foliage on the trees, the detailing which disguises the juncture in the middle ground between the two types of landscape, and the mordant gilding. This was among the final stages in the execution of a panel painting, and involved applying gold leaf over the paint surface. Cleverly, in parts of the painting which were intended to catch the light – such as the left side of God’s tiara and the yellow lining of his robe – decoration was done in mordant gilding, while paint was used on the darker right side. This technique is also found in other works accepted by Lippi.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Considering everything the painting has gone through, the individual parts are in quite good condition. Some of the colours have changed over time: the blue azurite of the Cherubim has darkened, as has the red vermilion used to paint the details of the seraphim’s wings. Parts of the mordant gilding has flaked off God’s tiara and the mandorla which surrounds him, and the dark area behind his head was originally a rich green.</p></div>

When his faith was discovered, he was executed. He miraculously survived being shot by arrows, so was beaten to death. Saint Sebastian was an enormously popular ‘plague saint’. Plague repeatedly ravaged central Italy in the fifteenth century, and the wounds of the arrows were thought to be like the swellings it caused.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made in the mid-1470s by two brothers, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonio</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero del Pollaiuolo</a>, for the private chapel (the Oratory of Saint Sebastian) of the banker and oligarch Antonio Pucci next to the courtyard of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. A relic – an arm bone believed to be Sebastian’s – was kept on the altar in front of the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The location had a direct impact on the scale of the picture which, at just under three metres high and over two metres wide, was an exceptional size for a private chapel.

When his faith was discovered, he was executed. He miraculously survived being shot by arrows, so was beaten to death. Saint Sebastian was an enormously popular ‘plague saint’. Plague repeatedly ravaged central Italy in the fifteenth century, and the wounds of the arrows were thought to be like the swellings it caused.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was made in the mid-1470s by two brothers, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonio</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero del Pollaiuolo</a>, for the private chapel (the Oratory of Saint Sebastian) of the banker and oligarch Antonio Pucci next to the courtyard of Santissima Annunziata in Florence. A relic – an arm bone believed to be Sebastian’s – was kept on the altar in front of the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The location had a direct impact on the scale of the picture which, at just under three metres high and over two metres wide, was an exceptional size for a private chapel.

This painting is slightly larger than most made for domestic use and – unusually – the figures are lit from the right. It may have been made for a specific location where the natural light also entered the room from the right – possibly a private chapel within the owner’s house, a luxury reserved for only the wealthiest citizens. It makes sense that such a patron would order a work from Verrocchio; his workshop was the most prestigious in Florence and there he trained several notable painters including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Verrocchio’s training and brief career as a goldsmith are evident in the elaborate brooches of pearls and rubies worn by the Virgin and the angel on the left, and the silk fabrics woven with gold thread. The leaves and stem of the lily are gilded, transforming it too into a luxury object. Technical examination has shown that Verrocchio used three techniques to render different effects with gold. The gold thread used in the lining of the Virgin’s robe and her lilac sleeves is created entirely with yellow paint, but the star at her shoulder and the fringe on the left angel’s sleeve are gold leaf applied over a sticky base called mordant. This real gold is the brightest and most tactile. ‘Mosaic gold’, a type of tin which shines less brightly than real gold, has been used in the borders of the robes and the ribbon that flutters over the shoulders of the left angel; it gives a more subtle gilded effect that does not distract us from the overall design. As far as we know now, this is the only example of its use in Florentine painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Verrocchio also practised as a sculptor and certain elements of this painting reflect that occupation: the crisp, geometric folds of the Virgin’s gown, the convincingly three-dimensional shape of the left angel’s head. This angel’s elegant left hand with its defined joints and elongated fingers is comparable to that of Verrocchio’s sculpture of the Woman holding Flowers (Bargello, Florence) dated 1475–80.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Parts of the picture seem to be by a different artist, however. Verrocchio’s output as a painter has been difficult to define, partly because of his practice of collaborating with his students. Here, it seems that he has allowed one of his students, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PX5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo di Credi</a>, to work on certain important parts of the composition including the Christ Child, the angel supporting Jesus and the curtains. Lorenzo worked in Verrocchio’s studio from 1473 until after Verrocchio’s death in 1488 and collaborated with him on a number of projects. Lorenzo’s style focused more on the flesh than the bone structure underneath, which is perhaps why he was tasked with painting the Christ Child. His involvement in this picture is given away by his angel’s left hand – the underlying structure of bones and muscle is less evident than in the hands painted by Verrocchio.</p></div>

The blind old man Tobit, a merchant and devout Jew, sent his son Tobias to the country of Media, near Assyria, to collect a debt. The family were exiles from Israel, living in Assyria. God sent the Archangel Raphael – the winged figure on the left of the scene – to accompany Tobias and his dog. Although he is shown here with wings, according to the text Raphael disguised himself as one of Tobias’s relatives.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tobias holds receipt of the debt, labelled ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">ricordo</span>’, in one hand and a freshly caught and gutted fish in the other – if you look closely, you‘ll see the red line of blood where its stomach has been slit. Raphael had instructed Tobias to catch and gut the fish, keeping its heart, liver and gall. Tobias gazes at the angel as though listening intently: according to the text, Raphael explained that these organs could be used as ointment to cure blindness and be burnt to drive away evil spirits. He holds the precious organs in a little box.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While on their journey the pair visited Tobias’s cousin, Sarah. She had married seven times, but each time a demon had killed her husband before the wedding night. Tobias decided to marry her and end the curse. On the wedding night he burnt the organs which, as Raphael had foretold, drove the demon away. The book culminates with Tobias’s return home, where he took Raphael’s advice and cured his father’s blindness. The artist expresses the figures’ momentum by painting their draperies rippling in the wind behind them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The quality of this picture ranges dramatically. Most of it seems to have been painted by an unknown member of Verrocchio’s large workshop. For example, both figures seem to have the exact same left hand, probably copied exactly from a model book. The fish, however, is like a minute <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a>, its scales reflecting the light like shining armour; it appears to be the result of very close observation. It has been suggested that Verrocchio’s pupil <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> may have painted the fish and the dog, which seem to have been added at the last minute – if you look closely you can see how the grass and shrubs behind show through the fur and scales.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tobias and Raphael’s journey to Media was very popular in the late fifteenth century when devotion to the Archangel, known as Saint Raphael, was promoted by a number of confraternities dedicated to him.  He became known as the patron saint of healers and travellers. Many rich Florentines, who might have commissioned such works, shared Tobit’s profession of merchant – it’s possible that an association with the charitable, honest and pious Tobit was desirable. The moral message could be disguised in the appealing imagery of a young man, an angel and a dog crossing a vast landscape.</p></div>
