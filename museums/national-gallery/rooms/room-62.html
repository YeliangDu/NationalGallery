        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Golden hair, rosy lips and pale skin were the ideal of feminine beauty in fifteenth-century Florence, and were features of images of the Virgin Mary and pagan goddesses as well as portraits of high-status women. Here they are paired with careful observation of the sharp lines of the woman’s long nose, revealing that this is a portrait of an individual, however ideally beautiful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has balanced the protrusion of the woman’s nose with the waves of her elaborate hairstyle, which is held together with a white band topped with a cluster of pearls. A fine black band encircles the top of her forehead, drawing attention to her fashionably high hairline. Around her long neck she wears a strand of orange beads with a pendant set with a large pearl. Baldovinetti has used tiny white dots to emphasise the shape and sheen of the beads and pearls. You can also see these little dots, so characteristic of his technique, highlighting the contours of the nose, chin and thick folds of the fabric of the sleeves.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The splendour of her outfit and the woman’s young age suggest the picture was painted as a marriage or engagement portrait. The main aim of marriage was to create alliances between families, to strengthen their political and social fortunes – and to produce children. A girl had very little choice in her husband, as the contract was arranged by her family. The image was made to show off the girl’s virtue and the prestige of the family that she would marry into, rather than her personal identity. The perfect white spherical quality of the pearl, for example, symbolised purity – an essential virtue for a young woman at marriage. According to social custom, the groom’s family were responsible for dressing the bride and they would have ordered the finest jewels and fabrics they could afford to show off their wealth and status. The cost of these items, as well as the commemoration of the marriage alliance, justified the expense of commissioning a portrait. The skill of the artist and the beauty of the bride would further enhance their reputation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By showing the woman in profile Baldovinetti was following a conventional format for portraits in Florence that continued until about 1470. It was adopted from images of emperors on Roman coins and medals and so was a symbol of power and social rank. Renaissance artists also created medals with portraits; those showing women often featured allegories of female virtue on the reverse. Paintings of women in profile became shorthand for the nobility of their character. Here the format serves the function of allotting equal prominence to the adornment on the woman’s sleeve as to her face. This emblem, which is made up of three palm leaves bound by a ribbon and framed by two gold-veined feathers, may be her husband’s coat of arms – although no one has yet established which family it belonged to. Its prominence here acts as a visual seal of the woman’s new life as a member of her husband’s household.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of at least six scenes of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a> painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a>. One of his most expansive and ambitious, it addresses the challenges of painting in a circular format called a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIW-0008-0000-0000.htm">tondo</a>. Often elaborately <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FS1-0008-0000-0000.htm">framed</a>, tondi were regarded as the most lavish type of picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Adoration was an extremely popular subject in Florence, as the event was celebrated with great pomp and splendour at the feast of Epiphany – there were even processions through the city streets. Earlier depictions by Botticelli (such as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DB1-0001-0000-0000.htm">panel he made with Filippino Lippi</a>) are rectangular, reflecting the movement of the procession towards the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. Later, pictures showing the holy family at the centre, as here, became more common.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting the procession converges upon the holy figures from both sides, emphasising the symmetry of the work. There are two layers of the entourage, with the outer circle arranged as a semicircle around the lower edge of the picture. Most of the figures and animals face inwards to pay respect to the Christ Child, inviting the viewer to do the same. The inner circle is separated from this group, raised up on a natural rocky platform with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and infant Christ. Although further back than the foreground figures, and therefore smaller, Botticelli has ensured that the viewer looks up towards them in reverence. The king kneeling deeply in front of the Virgin and Child shows the degree of respect we ought to pay them, as well as offering us a clear view of Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This careful and complex arrangement of the figures, who nonetheless appear to be gathered in natural groups, contrasts with the more obvious and striking compositional device at the centre of the image: the lofty ruined arches of a once imposing piece of classical building. A makeshift roof has been inserted within the central arch so that it doubles as the humble stable in which Christ was born. Crumbling classical architecture was a common feature in religious paintings in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> period; it fed an elite intellectual taste for classical antiquity and also delivered a message about how Christianity had surpassed pagan religion and culture (note how the keystone of the central arch has become dislodged). Likewise, the enormous peacock perching on a fragment of marble symbolises the eternity of the soul, made possible through the incarnation of God in Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture may be that seen by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a>, the sixteenth-century biographer of the artists, in the house of the Florentine Pucci family, who commissioned <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D79-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian</a></span> from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonio</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero del Pollaiuolo</a>.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Venus, the goddess of love, looks over at her lover Mars. She is alert and dignified, while he – the god of war – is utterly lost in sleep. He doesn‘t even notice the chubby satyr (half child, half goat) blowing a conch shell in his ear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was probably ordered to celebrate a marriage, and the unusual shape suggests it was a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">spalliera</span>, a panel set into the wall of a room. These panels were ordered to decorate the semi-public reception room known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">camera</span> (a sort of bedchamber).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Botticelli’s picture is colourful and amusing but was also very fashionable – the cultures of Ancient Greece and Rome were admired by the elite in Renaissance Florence. Mars’ well-defined body refers deliberately to ancient sculptures. It might have had another function: women gazing upon beautiful male bodies were thought to be more likely to give birth to boys, essential for continuing the family line.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, the goddess of love, is relaxed and regal as she props herself up on a cushion in a grassy glade. She gazes into the distance ignoring the semi-naked – and snoring – god of war, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mars</a>. His muscular body is as limp as his drooping finger, his head tipped back in sleep; we can almost see up his nose. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a>’s message here is clear: love has conquered war. Venus is victorious in this sexual encounter, while Mars is utterly lost in sleep.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The myth was popular among Florentines who knew the story of the love affair well. Venus was in fact married to the god Vulcan, an unattractive blacksmith. When he heard that Venus had been unfaithful to him, he made a fine net of chains to catch her in the act. The net was so delicate that the two beautiful gods did not know that they had been captured until it was too late. Vulcan invited all the gods from Mount Olympus to come and laugh at the trapped lovers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Botticelli has approached the story with a sense of humour, including lots of playful details intended to amuse his client. Mars is so deeply asleep that he is unaware that four childish <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyrs</a> are playing with his armour: one has stolen his lance and helmet, which covers his whole face; another has wriggled into the cuirass (body armour) under his elbow. He is not woken by the sound of the conch shell, which one of the mischievous creatures blows into his ear. The noise and commotion have disturbed a wasps‘ nest, and a swarm of the fat insects buzz around Mars’ head – he sleeps through it all. The shell was a symbol of Venus, who was born from the sea, which is just about visible in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Botticelli was well known for the mythological paintings he made for his most grand patrons, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, the ruling family of Florence. Botticelli’s association with Lorenzo de‘ Medici, known as Lorenzo the Magnificent, meant that he was in touch with all the contemporary scholars and poets who came and went in the Medici court. Lorenzo de’ Medici was keen on classical culture and he surrounded himself with people who were well versed in these subjects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s perhaps unsurprising, then, that an ancient account which matches the imagery of the playful satyrs in this picture exists. It is the Roman writer Lucian’s description of a painting showing the marriage of Alexander the Great to Roxana. In that picture little cupids (symbols of love) play with the warrior Alexander’s armour, two lifting his spear and another creeping into his breastplate. Botticelli has changed the cupids into satyrs, which might show his knowledge of a poem by the scholar and poet Angelo Poliziano, who was tutor to the Medici children. Poliziano’s poem, written at around the same time this painting was made, mentions ‘little goat-footed satyrs’. They were companions of a sleeping shepherd who inhabited a dream-like place of love and pleasure. Perhaps Botticelli was inspired by this poem, which he may well have known. This possible combination of sources of inspiration reflect the artist’s broad knowledge of contemporary and ancient culture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Botticelli also shows off his knowledge of ancient sculpture, so fashionable in Florence at the time. He has painted Mars as a fit and muscular warrior, his body resembling a classical nude sculpture, just toppled. Mars‘ left foot is caught in the pink cloth. This unusual detail might be a deliberate reference to a well known and admired ancient sculpture, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sleeping Hermaphroditus</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While Mars is nude, Venus is covered. The braids of her hair are attached to her dress, forming a border that is secured with a jewel – making her dress impossible to remove. Perhaps Botticelli intended to emphasise her chastity, despite her infidelity. Her blonde hair, pale skin and red lips are a nod to the contemporary ideal of female beauty as represented in poetry. Venus here is more like a contemporary Florentine beauty, or perhaps even an image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, than a classical sculpture – and quite different from the naked goddess that Botticelli painted in his picture <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Birth of Venus</span> (Uffizi, Florence).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This contradiction hints at the context of the painting. Panels of this shape are known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">spalliere</span> after the Italian word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">spalla</span> (’shoulder’). Works like this hung at shoulder height or above and were often part of the furnishing of the rooms of a newlywed couple within the groom’s family home. Commissioned to celebrate a marriage, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">spalliere</span> were some of many images – including religious works – that would have hung in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">camera</span>, the bedchamber. This was a semi-public space, not an intimate bedroom, where the couple might see visitors. The pictures that decorated it had to be impressive, interesting and sometimes – as in this case – entertaining. They also had to be appropriate for the space, which is why Venus is covered up. If she is supposed to refer to the new bride here, chastity was an essential virtue.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mars' state of undress can be explained in this context too: the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">camera</span> was where the couple would meet to sleep together in the hope of producing an heir. It was thought that looking at an image of a beautiful man would help a woman to conceive a boy – the most desirable heir, because a boy would continue the family line and carry the family name. The picture’s function is also hinted at by the myrtle bush behind Venus – it was a traditional symbol of marriage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But whose marriage could this panel have commemorated? The wasps might provide a clue: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vespe</span> is the Italian for wasp, and Botticelli might have been making a pun on the name of the noble Florentine family, the Vespucci, who were patrons of his. The sixteenth-century writer and painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Giorgio Vasari</a> notes that the Vespucci palace in Florence was decorated with paintings inset into the walls, but this was at a later date. It has even been suggested that the woman may be modelled upon Simonetta Vespucci, a renowned beauty whom Botticelli painted – but she died in 1476.  Whoever the picture was painted for, they were certainly wealthy and keen to show off their taste and education. By the 1480s, Botticelli was at the peak of his maturity as an artist, particularly in demand for mythological subjects.</p></div>

The combat takes place on a summer day: the hillsides are carpeted in lush green grass, and the neat, rounded treetops dense with foliage are reflected in the still, glassy water of a small river below. The only sign of commotion in nature is a swan, wings outstretched, in pursuit of its companion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such details reflect those used by the Netherlandish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Memling</a>, well known for his peaceful landscape backgrounds (see, for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donors (The Donne Triptych)</a></span>). This idyllic setting seems an unlikely backdrop for a serious contest – but that is exactly what it is. The battle of Love and Chastity was hugely important in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> society, representing the suppression of illicit passion in favour of chaste and faithful devotion in marriage, particularly on the part of women.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gherardo</a> worked more often as a miniaturist, which is reflected here in his attention to the smallest details. Chastity’s shield, for example, is beautifully embellished with gold and jewels – we can see one of Love’s arrows rebounding from it – and a variety of wild flowers, including little white clover, bloom in the grass.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The theme of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumph of Chastity</span> was the subject of one of a series of poems, called the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumphs</span>, by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ED6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Petrarch</a>. It describes how <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> had been riding a chariot full of his captives (those who succumbed to the power of lust) and was challenged to a battle by Chastity, as shown in our panel. She defeated him, watched over by her band of exemplary women. As punishment, the women tore the feathers from his wings and he in turn was paraded as a captive in Chastity’s chariot. Finally, Chastity led Cupid to her temple, where she lay down her victory wreath.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gherardo painted the other episodes in Petrarch’s poem as part of the same commission. The scenes spanned three separate horizontal panels, each about a metre long, and were probably sawn into individual scenes in the nineteenth century. Only three survive, including ours, from two of the panels; the entire third panel is now lost. Our scene formed the centrepiece of the first panel, flanked by one of Love’s chariot (lost, but known from old photographs) and another showing Chastity’s faithful companions (private collection). The second panel showed Cupid’s chastisement (lost, but again known through old photographs) while the final scene of Chastity’s triumphal chariot is at the Galleria Sabauda, Turin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The horizontal format of the original cycle suggests they may have been made, like Botticelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DE1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venus and Mars</a></span>, as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">spalliere</span> (paintings which were fitted into the panelling of the walls). Scenes from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumphs</span> were the most popular subject commissioned for the decoration of the rooms of a newly wed couple within the groom’s family palace.</p></div>

It’s one of a pair of panels made to commemorate a marriage, perhaps of one of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, the ruling family of fifteenth-century Florence. They were perhaps once set into the panelling of a bed chamber.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It shows the story of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FA0-0008-0000-0000.htm">King David</a>, who started life as a shepherd boy but rose to fame when he killed the giant Goliath, an enemy of Israel. According to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3K-0008-0000-0000.htm">Old Testament</a>, David was left behind when his brothers joined the Israelite army, which was fighting the Philistines. One day his father sent him to the army camp with food for them and he heard the Philistine champion, Goliath, challenge the Israelites to single combat. No one dared to respond even though Saul, King of Israel, promised great rewards to whoever killed the giant – including his daughter’s hand in marriage. In spite of his youth and inexperience, and his brothers' scorn, David offered to fight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the far left, David sits on the river bank, minding his father’s flocks. The stream helps us follow the narrative: it flows from left to right, in and out of the panel, joining the most important incidents. We next see him bending down to collect five smooth stones to put in the sling which he carries over his shoulder; according to the Bible, he preferred these to conventional weapons. In the corner are the lions which David boasted to the doubtful Saul he had killed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Next, David stands before Saul, who is mounted on a grey horse, and protests against the armour that servants are putting on him: he would rather fight without it. In the centre there’s a violent battle. The Israelites, dressed as contemporary knights in armour, charge the Philistines, who wear turbans. David, in pink, swings his sling, taking aim at the armoured Goliath, whose forehead is already bleeding. Immediately behind him, the Israelite cavalry is led by a knight with a gold torch holder on his surcoat (tunic) – this was an emblem used by the Medici, and is still displayed on the corner of the Palazzo Medici in Florence. Finally, in the foreground, David beheads the fallen giant.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pesellino was influenced by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paolo Uccello</a>, especially in his doll-like, if very conspicuously male, horses. They are similar to those in Uccello’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano</a></span>, though more lifelike. Pesellino had clearly studied real horses – look at the grey and the chestnut struggling in the foreground, and the fallen grey rolling on top of his knight by the river – although he was also influenced by equestrian sculpture. His interest in nature recalls the paintings of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pisanello</a>, though it’s hard to know how much he was influenced by Pisanello, and how much both were catering to the tastes of a sophisticated, courtly audience.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A fantastic procession winds its way through a Tuscan landscape dotted with hills and walled towns. Like its pair, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Story of David and Goliath</span>, the whole scene is crammed with activity. Trumpeters play and extravagantly dressed nobles ride prancing horses, while their hounds, a cheetah and a bear trot along beside them (during the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> cheetahs were kept for hunting).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This pair of long paintings probably decorated a bed chamber in fifteenth-century Florence. Painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4U-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francesco Pesellino</a>, their dimensions suggest that these panels were <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E7B-0008-0000-0000.htm">spalliere</a></span>, pictures set into the panelling of a domestic interior, usually at shoulder height, above chests or seating. They were perhaps made for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> to commemorate a wedding. The family are known to have had paintings by Pesellino.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of parades and processions were very well suited to this type of panel. Although it looks like fifteenth-century Italy, the story comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3K-0008-0000-0000.htm">Old Testament</a>. This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FA0-0008-0000-0000.htm">David</a>’s return to Jerusalem after killing the Philistine giant Goliath, an enemy of Israel. He stands proudly, holding Goliath’s head by the hair, the body slung on the cart behind him. The bloody stump of the giant’s neck is visible between his feet. Saul, King of Israel, leads the procession towards the walled city of Jerusalem. He wears armour and a crowned helmet decorated with a dragon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like his contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paolo Uccello</a>, Pesellino was intensely interested in showing animals, especially horses, in movement. The very emphatically male horses here are shown at a variety of angles – from the side, from the front, from behind – and in various poses. The way the muscles and heads are painted suggests he was working from drawings from life, like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pisanello</a>, although occasionally the arrangement of legs is inaccurate and he may well also have been looking at equestrian sculptures too.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the far right outside the walls a betrothal is taking place: a young man in contemporary Florentine costume is being presented to a young woman and her companions. This could be an allusion to David and Michal, Saul’s daughter, who fell in love with David and married him or, more probably, the couple for whom the paintings were intended.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A nymph – a mythological spirit of nature imagined as a young woman – lies on a patch of grass in the foreground, blood streaming from wounds on her throat and hand. A satyr, half man and half goat, kneels next to her, mourning her death. A dog sits at her feet, balancing the stooping figure of the satyr and seemingly mourning as well. More dogs appear at the lakeside in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that this painting depicts an episode from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, an influential poem by the ancient Roman writer Ovid.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A nymph – a mythological spirit of nature imagined as a young woman – lies on a patch of grass in the foreground, blood streaming from wounds on her throat and hand. A <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a> kneels next to her, mourning her death. A dog sits at her feet, balancing the stooping figure of the satyr and seemingly mourning as well. More dogs and a pelican appear at the lakeside in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that this painting depicts an episode from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> (VII, 752–65), an influential poem by the ancient Roman writer <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>. If this is the case, the beautiful nymph would be Procris, who was accidentally killed by her husband Cephalus. Believing that Cephalus was being unfaithful to her, Procris spied on him while he was hunting. Cephalus, hearing a rustle in the trees and thinking it was a wild boar, threw his spear, killing his wife. While Ovid’s work does not account for the satyr, it has been argued that the inclusion of this figure is due to a late fifteenth-century adaptation of the poem by Niccolò da Correggio. Although now little known, Niccolò was a celebrated author, his fame helped by the fact that he was also a courtier and military commander of noble birth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Regardless of the subject, the painting probably served as the backboard of a bench or a chest, or as part of the panelling in a Florentine palace. The framing element drawn on the back may give a clue to its now-lost wooden surround. The Florentine painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero di Cosimo</a> specialised in the production of paintings of such format, known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E7B-0008-0000-0000.htm">spalliere</a></span>. His sixteenth-century biographer, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a>, especially praised the ones he made for a member of the Vespucci, the same family for whom Sandro Botticelli may have painted his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DE1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venus and Mars</a></span>. Unfortunately, we don't know for whom our painting was made, but it was once owned by a member of the Guicciardini, a distinguished Florentine family, which may suggest that it decorated a property of theirs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Vasari also praised the artist’s great skill in depicting nature and animals, skills that are evident in our painting. There is a real sensitivity in the depiction of a dog mourning its beloved mistress – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> revealed through <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">technical examination</a> shows that Piero carefully adjusted the animal’s position – and the flowers on either side seem almost to be bending in empathy with the figures next to them.</p></div>

He rests the fingers of his right hand on the windowsill, and seems to fasten the stole over his black cloak with his left hand.

With windows on three sides, the sparse and narrow setting seems like it might be a balcony.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the fifteenth century there was a steady increase in the production of portraits as they were no longer commissioned solely by rulers or other high-ranking individuals. In Florence, wealthy merchants or members of noble families often wanted to have a portrait made that could be passed down to future generations. Such images would have commemorated the sitter after his or her death. In other cases, inspired by the poems of the fourteenth-century writer <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ED6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Petrarch</a>, portraits were made to mark a marriage or as a token of love. Unfortunately, we don't know anything about this sitter’s identity, let alone his motivations. The handkerchief in his right hand may indicate that he is thinking of his beloved.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QF1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raffaellino del Garbo</a> is not really known as a portraitist. He trained with the Florentine artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q79-0001-0000-0000.htm">Filippino Lippi</a>, and assisted him in an important <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> cycle in the Carafa chapel of the Roman church of S. Maria sopra Minerva. Following this, Raffaellino established himself as one of the leading painters of religious images in Florence during the first quarter of the sixteenth century. Two such paintings, roughly contemporary to this portrait, are in the National Gallery’s collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELE-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Two Angels</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E9B-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with the Magdalen and Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Because Raffaellino is best known as a painter of religious images, and in the absence of many other portraits as a point of comparison, scholars have only recently attributed this work to him. An inscription on the back actually names the German artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>, which may appear far-fetched: although Dürer visited Italy, he was far removed from Florence. But it is true that the sitter’s pose, with his hands on a parapet, and his placement at a window, recalls portraits painted north of the Alps.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In spite of his considerable output, Raffaellino is best known today for having trained <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea del Sarto</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P30-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bronzino</a>, whose fame eclipsed his own.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The unusual shape of this picture is the first clue to its purpose, and the lively literary story painted upon it, the second. It was probably made as a commemorative but also functional household object, known as a birth tray or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">desco da parto</span>. Such trays were given as gifts to celebrate a pregnancy or the birth of a child and would have been used to bring food and gifts to the expectant mother. In the centre of the image, a woman with three feathers in her hat is carried on the shoulders of a young man towards a boat moored at the island. The woman is the beautiful Helen, wife of the Greek king Menelaus captured by the Trojan prince, Paris. He awaits, dressed in armour, by the boat. According to the author of this particular version of the story, popular in Strozzi’s time, this was the moment the pair fell in love. Strozzi, who also painted manuscript illuminations, has included lots of small details – the boats in the sea, flowers on the lawn, and the little child fleeing the scene – to delight his client.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The unusual shape of this picture is the first clue to its function. X-ray images have shown that it has been cut down: it was originally larger and more elaborate with 12 sides. Panels of this shape were made as trays called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">deschi da parte</span>. They were given as gifts to pregnant women   and used to bring offerings into her chamber or room during her pregnancy. Sometimes they were given to celebrate the birth of a child. Research has shown that almost half of Florentine families owned a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">desco da parto</span>. Their popularity shows how important childbirth was in Renaissance Italy when many children did not survive into adulthood. The reverse of such trays were often personalised with the family’s coat of arms. This one has been thinned down and the reverse painted over and so we cannot know who the original owner was but it was probably, like Zanobi Strozzi himself, someone from a Florentine family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Birth trays were commonly decorated with secular imagery drawn from ancient mythology or literature. The popularity of these subjects reflected the increasing knowledge and study of ancient texts and art that characterised the Renaissance period. Here we see the abduction of Helen, the wife of the Spartan king Menelaus, by the Trojan prince, Paris: the action that sparked the Trojan War. This story was recounted in several versions including, most famously, in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Iliad</span>, by the ancient Greek poet Homer. This image is probably based on a translation of a text by Dares Phrygius that tells the Trojan side of the story, a version that was popular in this period. Phrygius stresses that Helen’s capture was welcome, since she fell in love with Paris at first sight, making it an appropriate subject for a birth tray.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Helen, with three feathers in her hat, is at the centre of the scene on the shoulders of a young blonde man. Paris, in the meantime, also blonde and dressed in armour with red ties, waits to take Helen on to the large boat moored nearby. Three other women are also seized – two within the temple itself while another appears to embrace her captor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Phrygius' version set the abduction at the Temple of Apollo on the Greek island of Cythera, a backdrop that allowed Strozzi to embellish the picture with delightful details. Boats with billowing sails fill the sea; fortified hillside towns encircle the slopes of the mountainous island across the water. The architecture of the temple is similar to that of a Florentine palace belonging to the Rucellai family which was built at about the same time that this tray was painted – the only hint that it is a temple is the statuette of the deity on a column at its centre. A little boy, perhaps a reminder of the child in whose honour the tray was given, darts across the flowery lawn away from the chaos inside the temple. The charm of these details reflects Strozzi’s main occupation as a manuscript illuminator; the small scale of book decorations inviting such attention to detail.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint George and the dragon must be one of the most fantastic saints‘ legends to come down to us from the Middle Ages. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span> George was a Christian knight from Cappadocia, now in Turkey. One day he came to the city of Silene, in Libya, which was being terrorised by a dragon. This beast, having eaten all the available sheep, was being fed children, drawn by lot from both rich and poor. The lot eventually fell on the king’s daughter, who was dressed as a bride and delivered to the place where the dragon lived.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">George, passing by on his horse, asked her why she was weeping. When the dragon appeared George attacked, but rather than killing it he told the princess to tie her belt around its neck and lead it to the city. There he promised the terrified citizens he would kill it if they all converted to Christianity. They hastily agreed, and George struck off the dragon’s head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paolo Uccello</a> has compressed two parts of the story into one small and distinctly strange painting. The saint on his prancing charger plunges his spear into the head of an oddly triangular dragon, whose shape mirrors the entrance to his cave; the elegant, but rather bored-looking, princess already has a leash around its neck. A crescent moon perhaps suggests that this is taking place as day changes into night, a transitional and therefore especially magical time. Everything about the picture, from the strange spiralling cloud to the odd landscape, makes this a scene from fantasy rather than the real world. Even the horse is also more dreamlike than lifelike: its neck is unnaturally curved, its hooves oddly angular, and its eyes and nostrils set too far forward in its head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know precisely who this painting was done for, or when it was painted, but its small scale and non-religious feel – it’s more about a magical adventure than Christian virtue – suggest it was intended for use in someone’s home, perhaps in a bedroom. Saint George was very popular throughout Italy. Two other versions of this story by Uccello and his workshop survive, one in the National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne, the other Musée Jacquemart-André, Paris. The style is quite close to Uccello’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hunt in the Forest</span> (now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford) and the princess’s clothes – look at her fantastic pointed shoes – seem to date from around 1460. But the saint’s armour looks rather earlier, and is similar to that worn by the knights in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano</a></span>, although less detailed. Perhaps Uccello was drawing it from memory, or just simplified it to suit a much smaller picture. Although Uccello was very interested armour and battle manoeuvres, he has adjusted reality for the sake of visual effect. George holds his lance incorrectly, so that it can line up with the dragon’s wing and the clouds, and his arm is bent up the wrong way.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Uccello was fascinated by linear perspective – using lines to create an impression of three-dimensional space within a painting – as you can also see in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano</a></span>. It was a relatively recent discovery at that time, and he has not quite mastered it here. The imagined lines go in different directions rather than receding to a single point, making the painting quite confusing to look at. The geometric patches of greenery lead towards a distant horizon – where you can just make out the walls of a city – but the strangely rectangular stones of the ground all slope up to the right. The spiralling cloud in the top right balances the curving depths of the dragon’s cave, drawing our eyes in different directions. The various vanishing points contribute to the sense of the magical and marvellous.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was perhaps made quite rapidly and cheaply. It’s in oil on canvas, and contains no expensive pigments or gilding. The canvas support might even have been reused: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectograms</a> show a curved geometric shape underneath the drawing for the princess’s dress, perhaps traces of an earlier heraldic design, which was possibly never completed and was covered with an extra layer of priming below the paint surface.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are several differences between the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> and the final painted version. The princess’s hands, her crown and the front of her dress were all altered, the cave has changed shape and George’s lance has been narrowed or moved up a bit. Some of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> have changed colour, especially the greens and blue – so the sky, which is azurite, looks greener than it would have been originally, and the green grasses are darker (there is a trace of the original colour along the bottom, where the paint has been protected by the frame). The green of the princess’s clothing has darkened while her red overdress has faded, so that she is now less colourful than she was originally. The strange pink <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> also appears in Uccello’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Niccolò Mauruzi da Tolentino at the Battle of San Romano</a></span>. The painting originally had blue painted borders, quite a common feature of early canvas paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1939 the painting was stolen by Nazis from its then owner, Count Karol Lanckoronski, and kept in the salt mines at Alt Ausee or possibly in the Immendorf Castle, with other works destined for the Hitler Museum. It was later recovered by the American army, and was bought by the National Gallery in 1959.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s hard to follow what’s going on in this large and busy painting, partly because it’s much darker now than when it was painted. This is one of three large battle scenes  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paolo Uccello</a> painted in the 1440s; the others are now in the Louvre, Paris and the Uffizi, Florence. All show episodes from the Battle of San Romano on 1 June 1432 – the flowers and oranges here show that it was high summer – an important battle in Florence’s war against Lucca, Milan and Siena over access to the port of Pisa</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The three paintings show key moments in the Florentine victory, although we are not sure what order they were meant to be seen in, or in what order they were painted. Our panel shows the Florentine commander Niccolò da Tolentino leading an attack. In the painting now in the Uffizi a knight, possibly the Sienese leader Bernardino della Carda, is unhorsed. The Paris panel shows Florence’s ally, Michelotto Attendolo da Contignola, giving an order to attack.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Battles are notoriously hard to depict, and Uccello has shown not the chaotic reality of a bloody conflict but a formal, almost courtly, scene. Painted some years after the event, the pictures seem more concerned with glorifying the Florentine victory than relating exact events, although some details do seem to be taken from eyewitness accounts. The knights wear field armour intended for war, but details of it are taken from the parade and tournament rather than the battlefield, and their prancing horses seem to have hopped off a carousel rather than out of a stable.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The main character here is Niccolò da Tolentino, riding a white charger at the head of a frenzied mass of horsemen, crests and lances. His personal emblem, the ‘Solomon’s knot’, appears on the banner held by his standard bearer. Although he grasps a baton of command, da Tolentino is not dressed for battle: he has a mail shirt but no steel cuirass (breastplate) over it; his helmet is carried by his page, who rides behind him, apparently indifferent to the brawl around them. Instead of a helmet, da Tolentino wears a magnificent <span class="dokuwiki_italic">mazzocchio</span>, a hat made of velvet cloth of gold. His short cloak is made of the same material. The hat, cloak and baton perhaps recall the gifts given to him by the grateful Florentines after the battle, and his gesture and rearing horse are very similar to contemporary equestrian monuments made for successful military commanders.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Just behind him, partly hidden, is a knight with an extravagant helmet and a surcoat (the tunic worn over his armour) of black and white waves. This is possibly Michelotto Attendolo, who was supposed to have rescued da Tolentino at one point when he was cut off from the rest of the Florentine troops. In the background two knights gallop away up the hillside – perhaps the messengers da Tolentino sent when he realised he was in trouble. At the far right, a knight fends off an attack from three others, in a manoeuvre contemporaries would have recognised from tournaments.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Uccello was fascinated by linear perspective, then a relatively recent discovery. He mixed traditional and modern techniques, using real silver and gold leaf for armour and fabrics, but experimenting with the laws of perspective to impose order on a chaotic scene. The broken lances in the foreground are arranged in a grid-like pattern, but the receding lines are blocked by the hedge rather than vanishing at a single point in the distance. The armour scattered on the ground is shown at various angles, but the foreshortening of the fallen knight’s body is reversed – his shoulders are larger than his feet, so that he looks back to front in comparison with the rest of the painting. It wasn‘t really until <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Mantegna</a> was painting in the 1450s that artists worked out how to do perspective properly (look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSH-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Agony in the Garden</a></span>, for example).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The thick hedge and the rising fields behind could be an attempt to show the battle’s location, which was described as taking place in a long hollow overgrown with vine and brambles. The whole impression, with the milling crowds, the clumsy perspective and rather doll-like horses, is almost more like that of a contemporary tapestry than a painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Once sparkling with burnished gold and silver and brilliant colours, the painting’s appearance has altered enormously over time, both from changes in materials and from the damage of repeated cleanings. The silver of the armour has tarnished, the bright vermilion in the knights’ banners and the horses‘ harnesses has turned blue-grey – look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D2I-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint George and the Dragon</a></span> to get an idea of the original effect – and the green of the hedge has darkened to almost black. The flesh tones on the men’s faces has worn away, leaving green underpaint showing through; both horses and landscape have lost their modelling and now look flat, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSE-0008-0000-0000.htm">glazes</a> of ultramarine over blue areas have been eroded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most dramatically it has lost its original arched top, removing the hilltops and sky which must have given it a less claustrophobic feel. All three paintings were designed to be hung high on the walls of a room with a vaulted ceiling. They had irregularly shaped corners designed to fit around corbels, and our painting once had three metallic fixings towards the top, presumably to anchor it to a wall. All were given new corners to change them into rectangles early on, when they were moved from their original location.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted for Leonardo Bartolini Salimbeni around the time of his second marriage in 1438, they were forcibly removed from the Salimbeni’s Florentine town house by Lorenzo de’ <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>  in 1484, and installed in his private room in the Medici palace. In 1492 they were noted in the inventory of the so-called Camera di Lorenzo, a large room overlooking the garden, where they hung with other battle, hunting and mythological paintings. Lorenzo must have enjoyed the sparkling depiction of former Florentine glories, however unscrupulously obtained. By the end of the sixteenth century they had clearly gone out of fashion: they'd been moved to a corridor near the chapel.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The focus of this picture is the loving gaze which passes between the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> and his mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. The infant is carried to her by two angels; he reaches urgently towards her as she holds out her breast for him, tenderly grabbing her little finger between his. This familiar baby-like gesture emphasises his humanity, which Christians believe enables God to empathise with humankind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although, according to the Bible, Christ was born in humble circumstances – in a stable, to poor parents – he and his mother are shown here in the same magnificent dress as the heavenly angels. The trim of the Virgin’s rich blue cloak is painted with fine brushstrokes to imitate the sheen of the gold thread with which it is embroidered; it is further embellished with precious gems. Her translucent veil is equally luxurious: the density of its rippling folds show how finely woven it is. The abundant lilac robe worn by one of the angels has a satin sheen and his sleeves are woven with gold thread, and the walls of the courtyard are made of colourful marble, represented by splashes of multicoloured paint. The figures are squeezed into the corner of a walled space, probably intended to represent the ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8X-0008-0000-0000.htm">hortus conclusus</a></span>’, the enclosed garden, which in medieval spirituality stood for Mary’s virginity – the setting expressing the paradox of the divine mystery of the virgin mother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is almost identical to one by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a> (now in the Museo di Capodimonte, Naples) which itself is probably based on a picture by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QIE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Filippo Lippi</a>. A <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0O-0001-0000-0000.htm">picture by an imitator of Lippi</a> in our collection also derives from that composition. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Virgin and Child with Two Angels</span> was long thought to be a derivation of the design by an unidentified Florentine painter but recent technical examination shows that it is likely to have been painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PXJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Verrocchio</a>, the painter who trained <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">X-radiographs show that the artist altered several details as he painted: for example, the Virgin’s padded headband replaces a plait and the haloes have been repositioned. Evidence of these kinds of changes of mind usually show that the painting was made by the master of a workshop – in this case Verrocchio himself– as opposed to one of his many students, who would often make paintings to his design. The picture also shares similarities with sculptures by Verrocchio, especially one of the Old Testament hero David (Museo del Bargello, Florence). The face of the young hero – particularly the narrow, almond-shaped eyes – is strikingly similar to that of the angel who peers directly at us in the picture. Verrocchio initially trained as a sculptor and a goldsmith before turning his hand to painting. The unusual structure of the palm tree in the centre of the picture seems to be based on a version made in metal – it looks more like an object resembling a palm tree than the real thing. The haloes too look like solid gold dishes rather than weightless discs of light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The very rich colours, especially the deep blue of the Virgin’s robe, show knowledge of the saturation of colour achievable in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil painting</a> technique. Verrocchio layered dark blue indigo, more commonly found in north Italian than Florentine painting, beneath the more traditional ultramarine to achieve this depth. The rest of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a> were commonly used by Florentine artists and all are bound with egg, as was traditional in the city. Elements of the technique, however, are unusual for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">tempera</a> painting. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that, rather than using fine parallel strokes called hatching to indicate areas of shadow, the artist used broad tonal washes. We know from unfinished paintings by Leonardo that he too used this technique when he was working in oil paint (as in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Jerome</span> in the Vatican Museums). He may well have learned this method from Verrocchio when he was a member of his workshop in Florence.</p></div>
