Their works were hugely popular in southern Europe, including Sicily and Naples where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello</a> was born and trained – Alfonso of Aragon, King of Naples, owned a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. Artists in the region sought to imitate the lavish detail of these works, as well as the oil painting technique used to achieve it. Niccolo Colantonio, Antonello’s master in Naples, was a copyist of the most famous Netherlandish painter, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Our painting is certainly by an artist hoping to evoke the style of his Northern European counterparts. Cracks in the surface of this picture – the result of painting over layers of still-wet paint – show an artist still grappling with oil paint, perhaps Antonello at the beginning of his career.  By the end of his life, Antonello had reached a level of skill in the medium that was rare in his Italian contemporaries; see, for example, the various textures he recreated in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a></span>. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Virgin and Child</span>, the jewels are not painted with the same precision as the objects in Jerome’s study, and the folds of the Virgin’s cloak and veil seem almost random, suggesting they were not painted from life. The dark background, strong lighting and simple shapes are also features of Antonello’s early works: a painting in the Walters Art Gallery, Baltimore, which is dated to his early years as a painter in the 1460s, has an almost identical composition, elements of which derive from earlier pictures made in southern Europe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lack of expression or communication of the thoughts of the holy figures has led to the suggestion that this work cannot be by Antonello, who was so expert at conveying psychological depth (see, for example, his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSU-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Portrait of a Man</a></span>). One possibility is that it is by Antonello’s brother, Giordano, or by his apprentice Paolo de Chaco, whom he took on in 1457. But there were many painters working in this style in southern Europe at this time, and their works and names are now lost, making it very difficult to know our painter’s identity.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This intriguing picture is as much a portrait of an object as the three men surrounding it. The figure in black is the Greek cleric John Bessarion, who reached the rank of archbishop in the Greek Orthodox Church. His attempts to unite with the Catholic Church brought him favour in Italy, where the pope made him a cardinal in 1439.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bessarion became a permanent resident in Venice in 1453, after the fall of Constantinople, the capital of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine Empire</a>, to the Islamic Ottoman Empire. He joined the Scuola della Carità, a religious <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a>, ten years later; the two men in white robes here are high-ranking members of that confraternity. The one to the right holds an instrument for self-flagellation, a practice that involves whipping your own flesh in order to purify your spirit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was made as a decorated door panel, and holes for the handles – now filled in – are still visible on the right hand side. It was part of a tabernacle which contained the reliquary before which the three men in the painting kneel in adoration. Reliquaries were made to hold relics – in this case two fragments thought to come from the Cross that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> was crucified on, as well as two scraps of fabric which supposedly came from his garments. These were contained in compartments above and below the upper arms of the golden crucifix in the centre of the reliquary.<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PAH-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Bellini’s</a> picture protected the reliquary, reminding those who passed it of its presence, and commemorated Bessarion’s generosity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bessarion donated the reliquary to the confraternity in the hope that it would inspire western Christians to help Greek Christians after the fall of Constantinople. Appropriately, it was a mix of Byzantine and Italian elements. Part of the paint surface are quite damaged but we can see the gold crucifix at its centre, which originally belonged to the Byzantine princess Irene Paleologina. It was later attached to a wooden box faced with blue and gold enamel, though Gentile has simplified the design. The two figures contained within vertical rectangles on either side of the Cross show the emperor Constantine and his mother Helena. Constantine was the founder of Byzantium, having converted to Christianity in 312 AD; Helena discovered Christ’s Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Many of Gentile’s pictures celebrate the links between Byzantium and Venice but none quite as explicitly as this one. Less than ten years later Gentile was in Istanbul painting the portrait of the Ottoman ruler, Mehmet II – a sign of Venice’s resilience, commercial attitude and the role of art in diplomacy.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A saint clad in shining armour raises his sword to strike a hideous demon beneath his feet. This is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Michael</a> fighting the devil, as described in the Book of Revelation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Michael’s commanding figure fills the space. His multi-coloured wings meet over his head and curve protectively around the man in a silk brocade robe who kneels at his feet (his robe has now faded: it would originally have been more purple in tone). This is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIM-0008-0000-0000.htm">donor</a>, Antoni Joan, lord of Tous, his heavy gold chain and sword identifying him as a knight. He holds a small book which displays, in Latin text, two of the so-called Penitential Psalms, a special group of psalms asking for forgiveness for sins.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the most important fifteenth-century Spanish painting in Britain. It was almost certainly the central part of a multi-panelled altarpiece, a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">retablo</span> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>, commissioned for the high altar of the church of San Miguel in Tous, near Valencia. It is the earliest documented work by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9R-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bartolomé Bermejo</a>, who received a downpayment for it in February 1468. De Cárdenas, known as ‘Bermejo’ because of his red hair or ruddy complexion, has signed the painting on a folded piece of parchment at the bottom left, using the Latin version of his nickname, ‘Rubeus’. No other parts of the altarpiece are known to survive, though it may well have included both painted and sculpted parts. Medieval Spanish altarpieces often had very elaborate frames; the strips of blue down each side of the panel were presumably visible through the carved and gilded wood frame.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As an image of good conquering evil, Saint Michael and the devil was a popular subject with late medieval artists; Carlo Crivelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Michael</a></span> and Piero della Francesca’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Michael</a></span> are almost exactly contemporary with Bermejo’s painting. The subject had a particular meaning in Spain, as Saint Michael was often associated with the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">reconquista</span>, the expulsion of Spain’s Muslim community by its Christians in the fifteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint is shown as a medieval knight, dressed in contemporary armour elaborated beyond anything made by man. Gilded plates encrusted with gemstones encase his body; his breastplate, belt and sword sheath are covered with green silk velvet. His wrists and ankles are ringed with pearls, a pearl diadem sits on his forehead and his golden breastplate reflects the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4S-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gothic</a> spires of Heavenly Jerusalem, the celestial city described in the Book of Revelation. In his left hand he grasps a round shield with a convex crystal centre. In spite of its obvious weight, his brocade cloak with its sumptuous red lining and jewelled edges billows behind him. This angelic warrior personifies the splendour of heaven itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as being highly decorative the painting has a strong underlying geometric structure. The graceful curve of the saint’s body in one direction is balanced by the mass of the cloak flying up in the other; the angle of his sword echoes the line made by the donor’s black hat and brocade robe. The pale oval of the saint’s face is framed by the curves of his arm and wings, and contrasts vividly with the rich colours of his dress and feathers. His bent right leg echoes the long line of his sword’s sheath, and his curved wings touch the ground, framing and containing the energy of his movement. The whole composition forms a triangle, with Saint Michael’s raised hand at the apex, and the donor and devil at the base. This large triangle is echoed by a smaller one encompassing the donor, kneeling in calm contemplation, in a vivid contrast with the writhing, sprawling demon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although his face is calm, Saint Michael has been caught mid-motion, balancing on the winged demon. From its red eyes, horns and gaping mouth to its armoured and reptilian body, it forms a hideous echo of the warrior-angel, reminding the viewer that devils were once angels. Its contorted limbs are half snake and its whole torso is another face, with eyes for nipples and snakes slithering from a mouth in its belly. Its clawed tail even curls around the saint’s armoured leg. Composite demons – those with bodies made up of parts of many creatures – were a traditional way of visualising evil in medieval art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bermejo shows off his mastery of oil painting techniques to create a vivid contrast of colours and textures, from the smooth reflective surfaces of the armour and the glitter of the chain mail to the deep, angular creases and crinkles of the textiles. His confident use of oil-glazing techniques sets him apart from other Spanish painters of the period. His interest in fabrics and the careful depiction of plants and flowers imply a deep knowledge of Netherlandish painting, in particular the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Memling</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>. It has sometimes been thought that Bermejo must have been trained in the Netherlands, but he could well have seen Netherlandish paintings in Spain. Altarpieces were being imported from northern Europe and displayed in Spanish churches in the late fifteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist’s work is also firmly embedded in Spanish painting traditions. Although the ground on which the figures stand looks real, the ornately punched gold background behind the saint is typical of Spanish medieval painting. Bermejo’s fusion of conventional Spanish practices with the latest Netherlandish techniques must have appealed to his patron’s desire to have an altarpiece that was at once modern and traditional, like those <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Carlo Crivelli</a> was producing at the same time in Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The rich colours of the oil paint, and the illusory shine of the metals and silks it creates, are contrasted with the real shimmer of the burnished gold  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>. The whole altarpiece must have glowed and glimmered in the dim light of a medieval church.</p></div>

In the foreground, three pairs of angels and men embrace; among their feet demons scuttle for shelter in the underworld through cracks in the rocks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Greek inscription mentions ‘the troubles of Italy’, a reference to the invasion of the French, who took Naples in 1494 and Milan in 1499, and to the civil strife in Florence itself. Botticelli associated these events with the turmoil mentioned in the biblical Book of Revelation, which talks about the end of the world and Christ’s second coming. The period of upheaval it described would end upon Christ’s return, when the devil would be buried, as in this picture.</p></div>

No fewer than 20 angels – all carrying leafy olive branches, a symbol of peace – preside over the revelry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The event takes place in a glade within a forest; the stable where, according to the Gospel writers, Christ was born, is represented imaginatively as a thatched roof pitched over the opening of a rocky cavern. The infant Christ reaches up towards the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, oblivious of his visitors – the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> on the left and the shepherds on the right, who have been ushered towards him by angels. The golden dome of heaven has opened up and become visible from earth; it is circled by 12 angels holding olive branches entwined with scrolls and hung with crowns which swing as they dance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The meeting of the divine and the human in the newborn Christ is shown symbolically in the dance-like embrace of three pairs of angels and men who form a rhythmic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a> in the foreground. Among their feet, winged demons and horned little devils scuttle for shelter in the underworld through cracks in the rocks. This is an unusual sight in a nativity scene but it is key to the understanding of Botticelli’s mystical creation, as revealed by the inscription at the top. In this, Botticelli interprets contemporary political events – which he calls ‘the troubles of Italy’ – in the light of the biblical Book of Revelation, which foretells the details of the end of the world and Christ’s second coming. The ‘troubles’ are probably a reference to the invasion of the French, who took Naples in 1494 and Milan in 1499, and to the civil strife in Florence itself. Botticelli has associated these events with chapter 11 of Revelation, which describes the invasion of the Holy City by Gentiles and the devil being unleashed. Christ’s return to earth would bring an end to this period of upheaval and the devil would be buried, as in this picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The apocalyptic message of the inscription reflects the teachings of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TIL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Girolamo Savonarola</a>, the popular and radical preacher whose sermons were causing a stir in Florence from the 1490s. After the death of Lorenzo de' <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> and the expulsion of his son Piero, Savonarola’s power in the city – now leaderless – grew even stronger, and Botticelli is thought to have been a keen follower. Savonarola saw the French invasion as divine retribution for the moral demise of the Italian states and was equally critical of what he saw as the overly luxurious lifestyle of the citizens of Florence. He isolated the city from its closest allies, particularly the Pope, and was eventually publicly executed in 1498.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After the political turbulence of the previous decade and the death of his spiritual and moral guide, Botticelli in this picture looks forward to the fulfilment of peace and to man’s reconciliation with God, as initiated by the Incarnation and expected to be achieved fully, according to the Book of Revelation, with Christ’s return.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis</a> stands on a marble ledge against a golden background. He wears a hooded brown cloak tied with a knotted cord, the habit (uniform) of the religious order of friars he founded, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Franciscans</a>. He embraces a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6A-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifix</a> and gazes compassionately at the tiny figure of the crucified <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. If you look closely you can see bright red blood on Christ’s feet and his white loin cloth, where it has dripped from the wound in his side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint is surrounded on either side by angels playing musical instruments, their feet supported by small clouds. His pose is inspired by the legend that his meditation on Christ’s suffering was so intense that, during a vision of Christ on the Cross, he miraculously developed the wounds of the crucifixion, known as the stigmata. We can see them here on his hands and feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Francis’s intense identification with the suffering of Christ led him to become known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">alter Christus</span> (‘another Christ’). This empathetic devotion was the hallmark of Franciscan spirituality and it became popular among the ordinary citizens of Florence too. This picture was probably made for private worship, and for a Florentine citizen rather than a friar, whose commitment to a life of poverty would have ruled out owning such a precious object. By offering a heavenly vision of Saint Francis’s religious experience the painting encourages emulation of his piety and devotion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was once inscribed in Latin along the bottom with lines from the Franciscan hymn, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Decus Morum</span>, followed by the date 1492. The inscription was removed in 1940 after scientific analysis revealed that it contained a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> called Prussian Blue, which only came into use in the eighteenth century. The modern inscription may have been added to complement the image of the saint in worship –  the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Decus Morum</span> was sung on the feast day of the stigmata on 17 September –  or it might have been an attempt to reinforce an older, or original, inscription.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was once thought to be by the Florentine artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q79-0001-0000-0000.htm">Filippino Lippi</a>, but cleaning and restoration in 2002 revealed that it was in fact very similar to works by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Botticelli</a>, Filippino’s teacher. It particularly resembles works from his early career, especially those made in the second half of the 1470s. The heart-shaped faces of the angels are typical of Botticelli’s work of this period; the way in which they are stacked up one behind the other to give the impression they are receding into the background is similar to how Botticelli painted crowds in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DB1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a></span>, for example. These comparisons suggest that the date of 1492 following the inscription is not accurate and therefore also not original.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is unusual for Botticelli, however: all the other examples of his work that show a single saint are fragments of something larger. The gold background is also unusual: in this period works with gold backgrounds were considered old-fashioned in Florence, although still popular in the nearby Tuscan city of Siena. The gold leaf has been incised with a sharp tool to create a diaper (diamond) pattern and then punched with a metal tool with six prongs. This tool might have been lost during the process as the lower part is punched with a five pronged punch. The incising and punching created a textured surface which would glimmer and sparkle in candlelight, intensifying the glory and mystery of the saint’s vision.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Duccio was the leading artist of fourteenth-century Siena.

This would explain the inclusion of Saint Aurea, the patron saint of Ostia, and Dominic, for the Cardinal was himself a member of the religious order that Dominic founded in the thirteenth century.</p></div>

He developed a style known for its grace, fluid lines and harmonious colouring. He is one of the most significant artists of the fourteenth century, who animated <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> models to create humane depictions of holy figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a triptych, a painting made up of three sections. The two smaller panels – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EBT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Dominic</a> on the left and Saint Aurea on the right – can fold inwards to cover and protect the central image of the Virgin and Child. This was essential as the triptych was most probably designed as a portable altarpiece for private prayer while travelling.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>’s long, slim fingers frame the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>’s tiny feet. Here Christ, still an infant, plays with his mother’s veil which is bordered with decorative gold lettering. His robe is purple, a colour reserved for the ruling elite from the time of Christ’s birth, used here to emphasise his divinity and importance for Christians. The delicately decorated haloes have been made by using a sharp tool to indent the soft gold leaf of the background. The four angels who enter the scene on either side emphasise the devotional nature of the image: the lower two clasp their hands in prayer, while the upper two waft the holy figures with incense contained within thuribles – perfume burners swung on chains.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Dominic wears the white robe and black cape worn by the preaching friars of the religious order that he founded in the thirteenth century. The star above his left shoulder may refer to the legend that at his baptism his godmother saw a bright star appear on his forehead. Saint Aurea is dressed in a gold-edged pink cloak over a green dress; her right hand is raised in blessing and in her left she carries a blue cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Once the two side panels were closed, the only clue to how the triptych was used was the pointed gable which remained uncovered. Its central focus is King David, regarded as the greatest King of Israel. He is surrounded by key figures and prophets of the Old Testament including Abraham, Moses, Jacob and Isaiah, who carry scrolls inscribed with extracts of their prophecies. Their presence offers a clue to the image of the Virgin and Child within: the prophets foretold that a king greater than David would emerge in Israel. New Testament writers associated Christ – a spiritual, rather than earthly king – with this figure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Duccio made this triptych for Niccolò degli Albertini da Prato, who became Cardinal Bishop of the Roman port city of Ostia in 1303. Records show that he owned three such portable altarpieces. The Cardinal was probably involved in choosing the images, which explains the inclusion of Saint Aurea, the patron saint of Ostia, and Saint Dominic, since he himself belonged to the Dominican order. X-ray images show that a leather strap once held the triptych closed for travelling and that the reverse of the side panels bore the Cardinal’s coat of arms.</p></div>

The image of the Virgin ascending into heaven in splendour was particularly important in Siena, and the use of these colours here may be intended to recollect this event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sienese painting was well known for its emphasis on surface pattern; artists frequently embellished the textiles in their works with complex designs using real gold. Fungai has used the traditional <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffito</span> technique, which involves coating an area of the panel with a layer of gold leaf before beginning to paint. He painted shadowed areas in grey and those that would catch the light in white. In the latter areas – such as the Virgin’s knees – he scratched the paint away in the design of the brocade decoration to reveal the gold beneath, scraping lines into the soft metal to create texture. In the shadowed places, he simply painted the pattern on using an orange-brown paint, replicating the effect of dim unlit gold. This is especially obvious if you compare the part of the cloak that covers the Virgin’s right arm with that covering her left, which is in shadow.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This innovative illusionism creates the sense of volume and three-dimensionality in the Virgin’s figure. The areas where the real textured gold is revealed would also respond to natural light, and it is possible that Fungai took the painting’s position in relation to a window into account when he was working out the design. Fungai clearly had a reputation for his skill at manipulating gold: in 1494, at about the time that Fungai made this work, he was commissioned to gild and paint some ceremonial banners and in 1499 he gilded the organ case in Siena Cathedral.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dotted around the landscape in the distance are the events surrounding the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a>. The circular shape (called a tondo) had become popular in the mid-fifteenth century, and here gives Fungai the space to depict these narratives which might otherwise be shown in separate panels, either to the side or in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>. Christ’s birth is shown at the left of the panel: Mary and Joseph worship him in front of a ruined structure. In the sky above, the angel of the Lord announces the news of Christ’s birth to the shepherds, as described in Luke (2: 8–15); we can see their flocks on the hillside below.

Here, it creates a sketchy, slightly out of focus effect that emphasises the distance and vastness of the landscape. Fungai looked to Umbrian painters and seems to have been particularly inspired by the soft effects and subtle blending of colour by artists like Perugino (as seen in his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HXC-0001-0000-0000.htm">panels from the Charterhouse in Pavia</a>).</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was the central panel of a large altarpiece made for the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. The Virgin’s sturdy form, which looks similar to contemporary Florentine sculpture, casts a shadow against the carved throne. Christ’s body seems fleshy and three-dimensional; Masaccio has done this by showing how certain areas catch the light, painting them with a lighter tone. His ability to represent holy figures as though they were human was innovative and influential.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Masaccio also used the new technique of single-point perspective, which helped to make certain objects appear closer and others further away.  This is clearest in the ‘V’ shape created by the angle of the angel’s lutes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ is shown eating grapes. It’s a reminder of the wine of the Eucharist, which Christians drink in remembrance of the blood Christ shed at his crucifixion, a scene of which would have sat above this image.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was once the central panel of an altarpiece, probably a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>, made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q94-0001-0000-0000.htm">Masaccio</a> for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Carmelite</a> church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. It was commissioned by a man called Giuliano degli Scarsi for the burial chapel that he built for his family. The chapel no longer exists – the church was remodelled in the seventeenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Given his success and popularity it’s likely that Masaccio painted several altarpieces, but this is one of only four that survive. He painted this one without his frequent collaborator <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Masolino</a>. While it’s likely that assistants helped him with some of the smaller panels, he painted the Virgin and Child alone. It’s a good example of many of his unique innovations which made him one of the most influential Italian painters of the early fifteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> dominates the panel, her bulky thighs creating a sturdy seat for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>; he sits comfortably, eating grapes. She looks like an enormous sculpture, clothed in heavy blue drapery. Christ, although just a baby, is equally imposing – the folds of fat on his wrist and chubby legs have been given shape with shading and highlighting, so that some areas appear in shadow and others stand out. This sense that his flesh is catching the light helps give the impression that he has a real, physical presence and that there’s a source of natural light in the scene. Masaccio has used the same technique to make the folds and creases of the Virgin’s robes look three-dimensional, and further emphasises Christ’s and Mary’s solid presence by painting their shadows (the Virgin’s body, for example, casts a shadow on the throne).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s halo projects both forwards and backwards rather than just sitting behind his head. This completely new way of painting haloes suggests that there’s space between him and his mother, in turn encouraging us to see them as real figures, actually taking up space – ours.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Masaccio was deeply interested in sculpture; it has even been suggested that he practised as a sculptor early in his career. He may have painted this altarpiece in Pisa, rather than his hometown of Florence. There he would have seen the work of the thirteenth- and fourteenth-century Pisan sculptors, Nicola, Giovanni and Andrea Pisano. Nicola’s renowned pulpit in the Pisa cathedral baptistery featured multi-figured scenes showing the life of Christ, and Masaccio seems to have copied certain details in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> panels.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The most important lesson that Masaccio learnt from sculpture, however, was the sense of reality that its imitation could give his holy figures. This he probably took from his fellow Florentine, the sculptor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a>, who was working in Pisa at the same time. Masaccio might have based his image of the Virgin and Child on Donatello’s work; a sculpted relief showing the Virgin and Child with angels seated on the foot on the throne playing lutes (now in the Victoria and Albert Museum, London) could be a specific source. Alternatively Donatello himself might have been involved in the project – Giuliano’s records show that the sculptor was with Masaccio when he picked up one of the payments for the altarpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two artists certainly knew each other’s work and shared an interest in setting figures within their surroundings using the laws of perspective. This involved increasing and decreasing the size of objects proportionally in relation one single point in the centre of the image (the vanishing point) so that objects further away appeared smaller while those closer to the viewer seemed larger. Donatello, in his sculpture, and Masaccio in his painting made advances in this technique that changed the course of painting in Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Straight lines and architectural forms were useful in enhancing a realistic sense of perspective partly because viewers‘ understanding of these shapes as three-dimensional objects helped them to believe the painted version. The Virgin’s throne, for example, looks like a classical-style building within which the Virgin sits. Like Christ’s halo its depth suggests there is space around it, despite the gold background. The small colonettes seem to make it look even bigger and more sturdy. The pale grey stone would have reminded viewers of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pietra serena</span> – the stone which the Florentine architect <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TK7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Brunelleschi</a> used in his churches and a contemporary trend in architecture. In the same way, the angels’ lutes which point in and out of the picture reinforce the idea that the space they sit in is a continuation of our own.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The wavy pattern on the throne step is not purely decorative – it’s supposed to bring to mind Roman marble tombs (sarcophagi). The black grapes that Christ eats had another meaning too: they recall the wine of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>, consumed along with bread in remembrance of Christ’s body and the blood he shed at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. A panel showing the Crucifixion was probably placed directly above this painting; this vertical arrangement of images spelt out the Christian message of salvation through Christ’s death and its remembrance. Despite its clear theological message, the way in which the Virgin looks at the Child – as though with sadness at the thought of his future sacrifice – brings psychological realism to the image, another of Masaccio’s influential innovations.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The most complete record of the appearance of the original altarpiece comes from the second edition of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a>’s biography of Italian artists, published in 1568. He described the Virgin and Child in the centre, with ‘some little angels playing music’. These were surrounded, he noted, by Saints Peter, John the Baptist, Julian and Nicholas. He mentioned a scene of the Crucifixion above the Virgin and Child, and that the predella included an image of the Adoration of the Kings. The three panels from the predella and the Crucifixion are in other museums but the location of the saints surrounding the Virgin and Child is not known. A number of Carmelite saints on small vertical panels have been identified; these probably decorated the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilasters</a>.</p></div>

The infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, a string of coral beads around his neck, plays with the book held by his mother, pulling on the red book mark. The pair are serenaded by angels who stand to either side of the throne playing a lute and a harp. The luxurious carpet – an item of very great value in northern Europe in the sixteenth-century – is probably based on a real rug. Look closely and you can see how the artist has suggested ​its texture: the pattern is rendered in darker colours, ​with small dots modelled in lighter hues to indicate the texture ​of the knots. Parts of the design are Turkish, but the curving outer border is of a type not found in Turkish carpets: it is more Persian in style. It maybe from a region of eastern Turkey or western Iran.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PXN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Quinten Massys</a> knew a great deal about fifteenth-century Netherlandish painting. The composition, particularly the two musical angels, refers back to the much-copied <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Virgin and Child in an Apse with Two Angels</span> - there is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FT8-0001-0000-0000.htm">a version</a> in our collection - while Christ playing with his mother’s book and the flying angels are reminiscent of another much-copied image, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Duran Virgin</span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At first glance it seems that Massys has created an illusion of space and symmetry, but on closer inspection you can see that both are subtly distorted. The figures are all on different scales: the Virgin is massive and evidently intended to dominate the tiny church, while the flying angels are not much bigger than Christ. The central vertical axis lies between the Virgin’s eyes, but the church is left of centre, while the dais and throne are right. The carpet, a visually important item, is not central on the dais, the flying angels are shifted to the right and the standing angels are not in the same plane. The overall impact is both disturbing and fascinating, and the strange broken colours enhance the impression of mystery. The painter seems to have been keen to create a devotional work of great complexity that would encourage careful and repeated viewing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The rather solemn Christ Child may have a more serious task than apparently playing with the bookmark: he is perhaps reading and marking the Old Testament prophecies which will determine his fate. His bookish interests may perhaps have appealed to two of the painting’s former owners, both noted book collectors: the Revd Walter Sneyd (who died in 1888) of Keele Hall, Staffordshire, and Charles Dyson Perrins (who died in 1958), whose fortune came from Lea and Perrins Worcestershire sauce. The painting is generally in good condition, although the red lake <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSE-0008-0000-0000.htm">glazes</a> on the Virgin’s mantle have faded unevenly.</p></div>

She too is barely able to stand. Her attribute – a pot of ointment with which she anointed Christ’s feet in recognition of his divinity (Luke 7: 36–50; John 12: 1–8) – is at the foot of the Cross. The episode was regarded as foretelling Christ’s death, as ointment was also used for corpses. A skull lies next to it, a reminder that the place where Christ was crucified was called Golgotha, meaning the place of the skull; this was where, according to tradition, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam</a> was buried.

While the figures of the Virgin and Christ resemble those in other of Memling’s works, the painting has sometimes been thought to be by a follower. But the very detailed and delicate painting technique suggest the hand of Memling himself.

Its pattern appears in other paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Memling</a> – notably his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triptychs of the Two Saint Johns</span> (Memling Museum, Bruges) – and the motifs are the same or almost the same size. Memling ran a large and well-organised workshop, and tended to recycle designs based on workshop patterns with little variation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figures of the Virgin and infant Christ also resemble those in other Memling works. The rather restricted composition can be paralleled in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Man of Sorrows in the Arms of the Virgin</span> (National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne) of 1475. The Virgin’s shoulders are very narrow, but in this and in other respects she resembles the Virgin in the centre panel of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triptych of Jan Floreins</span> (Memling Museum, Bruges) of 1479. Our painting has sometimes been thought to be by a follower rather than Memling himself, but the very detailed and delicate painting technique is close to that of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saints and Donors (The Donne Triptych)</a></span>. Close inspection reveals that the white catchlights in Christ’s left eye are made up of seven separate brushstrokes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are not sure whether the painting was once part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a> or stood alone; the Christ Child could be blessing a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIM-0008-0000-0000.htm">donor</a> on his right. The panel is almost exactly the same size as Memling’s portraits of Willem Moreel, a prominent Bruges politician, merchant and banker, and his wife Barbara (Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels), which were certainly the wings of a triptych. But it is unlikely they flanked this painting, as the Virgin is rather smaller than the two Moreels, and the compositions do not balance. Perhaps Memling was simply using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panels</a> of a standard size. Our painting could equally have stood alone, with the infant Christ gesturing and speaking to the viewer rather than a painted donor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bare strip of wood around the sides would originally have been covered by the frame, now missing. The reverse is covered with black paint. As this does not quite extend to the edges, it may have been applied when the painting was still in its original frame.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin Mary, the Christ Child in her lap, is seated on a marble throne that is topped with an elaborately carved canopy. Below, an angel offers a rose to Christ, but he is distracted by the pear held out by a second angel. Smaller canopies cover the niches on either side, which house the Archangel Michael on the left and an unidentified bishop saint on the right. Michael raises his sword, ready to strike the devil pinned beneath his feet – a reference to the cosmic battle described in the Book of Revelation (Revelation 12: 16).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arches in the background are filled with a gilded three-dimensional pattern, which was created by building up a chalk-based ground that was then delicately carved away. The small size and high degree of finish of the painting, as well as its decoratively marbled reverse, suggest that it was intended as a private devotional picture.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The decorative elements of this small panel, which shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin and Child enthroned</a>, are highly inventive and unusual. The elaborate throne is topped with an intricate triangular canopy, which is painted to imitate carved stone that has been delicately cut out or ‘pierced’ to reveal coloured marble within. Smaller canopies cover the niches on either side, which house the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Michael</a> on the left and an unidentified bishop saint on the right. The spaces between the throne’s stone trefoil (three-lobed) pointed arches are filled with a gilded three-dimensional carved background, which was created by building up a chalk-based ground that was then delicately carved away, like a miniature wood or stone carving.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Michael raises his sword, ready to strike the devil pinned beneath his feet. The reptilian creature clutches desperately to the saint’s legs, jaws open in anguish. This cosmic battle is described in the Book of Revelation as an event that would occur at the end of the world (Revelation 12: 16). At this time, Michael would also play a role in the judgement of souls, weighing up their good and evil deeds. Here, a small figure representing a soul is kneeling on one side of the scales held by the saint. On the other, two little devils attempt to tip the verdict in the favour of evil, weighing their side down with a miniature millstone. The bishop saint is still in contrast with the drama of the figure of Michael. He holds a book and a crosier (bishop’s crook), and his jewel-encrusted mitre (hat) obscures most of his halo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin’s melancholy expression is at odds with her vivid, exuberant surroundings. But the infant Christ lying on a white cloth on her lap recalls images of the adult Christ naked on his burial shroud at the Lamentation, where the Virgin mourns her son after his death. She clasps the sole of his foot tenderly here, drawing attention to the place where he would be wounded by the nails of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. The little angels surrounding the mother and child offer amusing diversion from the intensity of the Virgin’s thoughts of her son’s fate. Set in miniature niches, they are like sculptures brought to life. One angel at the Virgin’s feet offers a rose to Christ, but he is distracted by the pear held up by another angel. Those at the Virgin’s shoulders look down to see what’s going on. At the very top, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Gabriel</a> greets the Virgin Mary, who bows her head in acceptance of the news that she will conceive the son of the God – the beginning of the Gospel stories that end with Christ’s death and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">resurrection</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The small size and high degree of finish of the painting, as well as its decoratively marbled reverse, suggest that it was intended as a private devotional picture. The colours are well preserved, suggesting it may have been covered by shutters, but as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> has been trimmed down there is no evidence of the hinges that would have held the shutters in place; it may have been protected by a cover instead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michael Pacher</a> and his workshop were well known for making large altarpiece ensembles that included paintings and wood carvings (such carvings may have inspired the effect of the background in this work). This picture is sometimes thought to have been painted by members of Pacher’s workshop, but its sophistication and complexity make this unlikely. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared photographs</a> show that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> on this panel, where visible, is very similar to that on panels that are certainly attributed to the master himself. Apart from the difference in scale, the underdrawing resembles that of the large altarpiece he made for the church of Saint Wolfgang in the town of Saint Wolfgang im Salzkammergut.</p></div>
