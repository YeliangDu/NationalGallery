        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Archangel Michael led an army of angels to battle against the devil and cast him down from heaven (Revelation 12: 9). Piero shows him as a beautiful, youthful soldier, dressed in Roman armour, embellished with gemstones. Golden curls frame his smooth pale skin and full lips. His strength and courage are proved by his grim accessory – the severed head of the devil, represented as a snake with pointy ears and a full set of fangs. The kill is fresh: the reptilian head seems to still be screaming in anguish, blood dripping from its mouth; Michael pins the body down with his foot as its tail continues to rattle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Michael’s pale wings match his skin. A cool light washes over him, casting the left side of his legs and face in shadow. His pose, where most of his weight is on his left foot and his body sways gently in the opposite direction, is called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">contrapposto</span>; it was adopted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> artists who were copying the graceful style of Classical sculptures. The definition of the muscles of his chest and abdomen beneath his breastplate also recalls the idealised bodies of ancient nude male sculpture. His skin is notably pale and – perhaps to stress this visual connection with sculpture – Piero has made no attempt to differentiate the archangel’s skin from that of the marble decorating the low wall behind him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel was part of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> made for the church of Sant‘ Agostino in Piero’s hometown of Borgo Sansepolcro. It was placed to the immediate left of the central panel, now lost, which depicted the Virgin and Child according to both sixteenth- and nineteenth-century descriptions.  The lower right corner of the panel includes part of the step of the Virgin’s throne and part of her cloth of gold cloak. Michael was paired with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Augustine</a>, who stood to his left (now in the Museu Nacional de Arte Antiga, Lisbon); to the right of the Virgin were Saint John the Evangelist (The Frick Collection, New York) and Saint Nicholas of Tolentino (Museo Poldi Pezzoli, Milan).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The archangel’s inclusion may be related to the name of the patron of the altarpiece, Angelo di Giovanni. Michael was very popular in Sansepolcro: the pilgrimage to Monte Sant’ Angelo in southern Italy, 325 miles from Sansepolcro – where Michael was thought to have appeared miraculously – was the most popular pilgrimage among the citizens of the town.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Piero was in great demand when he was commissioned to make this picture which may explain why, even though he signed the contract to make it in 1454, it was not completed until 1469.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the earliest surviving work by the innovative Tuscan painter, Piero della Francesca. Very few of his works survive, but there are three in our collection. Here, Piero used mathematical principles to order his simple design, creating a visually harmonious image, and set it within a landscape familiar to its original viewers, uniting them personally with this moment in the history of Christianity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> stands in a shallow, winding stream as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a> reaches up to pour a small bowl of water over his head. We can see the water trickling over Christ’s hair onto his forehead. Three angels, with colourful robes and multicoloured wings, witness the event; two of them hold hands while one leans amiably on his companion’s shoulder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">John had been preaching in the wilderness, encouraging people to repent of their sins and to be baptised: the river’s water symbolised the washing away of sin. In the background a man bends over as he takes off his tunic in preparation for his turn. When Christ came to John asking to be baptised, the latter initially refused: as the Son of God, Christ was already sinless. Christ’s insistence was an expression of his humanity and humility. It was at this moment, though, that his divinity was announced. According to the Gospels, the voice of God declared, ‘This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased’ (Matthew 3: 16) and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> descended upon Christ in the form of a dove. Piero has shown the dove as though flying out of the picture towards us. The angel wearing a garland of roses gasps – the only sign of commotion in the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s baptism, as recorded in the Gospels, was likely to have involved full immersion in the river Jordan, but it was more usually depicted like this. The mirror-like surface of the water in the distance reflects the wooded mountains, the glassy effect contrasting with the otherwise chalky look of the egg tempera paint Piero used. Curiously, the water seems to stop flowing at Christ’s feet – we see the pebbles of the riverbed in the foreground of the picture instead. Piero may have been inviting us to imagine we are standing in the river, looking straight through the clear water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Piero made this picture for the church of San Giovanni Battista in Val d’Afra in his hometown of Borgo Sansepolcro – the walls and turrets in the distance are probably supposed to represent the town. The valley setting resembles the landscape around the town encouraging worshippers to imagine the extraordinary moment occurring on their doorstep. The mountains in the distance, the stream and the walnut tree were features of the local landscape. According to legend, the town had links with Christ’s homeland from its origin in the eleventh century. A miracle occurred when two pilgrims travelling back from the Holy Land decided to rest beneath a walnut tree: when they woke up, their knapsack containing holy relics had flown up to one of the tree’s highest branches. This miraculous event led to the town’s foundation, which was named after the pilgrims’ relic of a stone from the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. Piero included a variety of species of plants which are still native to the area today, and which would have been instantly recognisable to the painting’s very first viewers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">What should we make of the tiny figures – singled out by their large, unusually shaped hats – just beyond the bend in the river? They might be intended to represent the three wise men from ‘the East’ who, guided by a star, visited the newborn Christ to offer him gifts. The feast of the Epiphany, which celebrated the event, was held on 6 January, the same day that Christ’s baptism was celebrated. The people of Sansepolcro would have recognised these headdresses as Byzantine: in the same decade as this picture was made, Greeks from Constantinople, the capital of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantium</a>, came to Italy to attend the councils which attempted to unite the eastern Orthodox and western Catholic Church. Artists took the opportunity to sketch the foreign visitors, and they began to find their way into Italian paintings as symbols of the East.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as rooting the scene in the local area, Piero also uses mathematics to make it look convincingly three-dimensional. Piero – whose father had hoped he would become a merchant, like him – was thoroughly trained in mathematics. He was the first artist to write a treaty on perspective, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">De prospectiva pingendi</span>, using mathematics to explain how to paint objects in proportion so that they appear in the painting as they are seen in real life. Here he used a grid structure as a guide for the placement and scale of objects. The layering of the elements of this picture – the angels occupy a space between two trees, and the man removing his gown is set between the distant figures in their elaborate headdresses and John the Baptist – echoes this invisible grid. The figures, carefully placed behind one another and gradually getting smaller, lead us into the painting, as does the river that winds away from us. In this way, Piero emphasised the depth of the landscape and the harmony of the figures and natural features within it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The visual harmony which comes from the figures and features seeming to inhabit the landscape so naturally is one reason that the picture seems to instil a sense of calm. Piero gave the figures, particularly Christ and John, graceful poses: both appear mindful of their bodies and actions, encouraging us too to find stillness in our contemplation. He has directed our gaze to Christ’s body, the anchor of the scene, reinforcing this through the strict alignment of the dove, the bowl and Christ’s praying hands. This vertical line is doubly strengthened by the pale trunk of the walnut tree, which matches Christ’s white flesh.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At some point in the 1460s the panel was joined by two side panels,<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm"> pilasters</a> and a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> with gilded backgrounds, painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Matteo di Giovanni</a>, another local artist.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Piero della Francesca depicted Christ’s Nativity as a miraculous vision materialising on top of a hill near his hometown in rural Tuscany. He based his scene on a famous account by Saint Bridget of Sweden (about 1303–1373), a late-medieval mystic whose revelations were widely read in the fifteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin Mary kneels in adoration of her new-born son in front of a ramshackle shed. She is accompanied by her husband Joseph, seated on the donkey’s saddle in a pose drawn from a famous ancient statue known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Spinario</span>, in which a young boy pulls a thorn from his foot. Behind him are two shepherds, one of whom looks out at the viewer while pointing to the divine light falling on the shed’s stone wall through a hole in its roof, the other apparently following the gesture with his gaze. This has also caught the attention of the braying ass, while the ox lowers his head and gazes at the infant. A group of singing and music-making angels – whose loose, draped clothing evoke classical sculpture – provide a heavenly soundtrack to this otherwise rustic scene, recognising the incarnation of the divine in Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Piero placed the figures within a tranquil Tuscan landscape recalling the surroundings of his hometown of Borgo San Sepolcro. A river meanders through rolling hills peppered with trees at left, while rooftops and a church are visible on the right. By setting Bridget’s vision within a familiar landscape, the artist brought the extraordinary circumstances of Christ’s birth directly into his own world. The scene’s realism is heightened by Piero’s attention to its finer details; three finches perch among the rocks and plants growing in the foreground, while a magpie has settled on the stable’s roof - its run-down character, and the exposed and dusty aspect of the rocky setting emphasise Christ’s humble beginnings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Within this somewhat desolate and windblown setting, the Virgin Mary’s beauty and serenity as she meditates upon her son are all the more arresting. Her flawless pale complexion and fair hair – covered with a delicate, gauzy veil – follow Renaissance ideals of beauty. Kneeling in veneration before her son, she has offered her deep blue mantle – all she has – to protect his naked skin from the earth. She is depicted as both humble and majestic, her hair and neckline adorned with pearls.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Likely painted in the early 1480s, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Nativity</span> was among Piero’s last works. Its harmonious composition is characterised by the artist’s distinctive cool colour palette and profound luminosity. Thanks to his use of oil paint, its colours appear more saturated than in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baptism of Christ</span> (NG665), which he executed in egg tempera.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Piero made <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Nativity</span> for his family palace in Borgo San Sepolcro where it remained until 1825, initially hung in the principal bedchamber. While still in the family, parts of the paint surface were badly damaged by overcleaning. Subsequent misunderstandings about its condition led some to believe that <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Nativity</span> was unfinished. However, restoration of the damaged areas and conservation treatment completed in 2022 brought Piero’s original intention back into focus; such as the composition’s sense of space, the divine light falling on the stable wall, and the figures’ shadows that were intentionally omitted to emphasise the miraculous nature of the event.</p></div>
