        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young woman is moving towards an open window or door through which a hilly landscape can be seen. She turns to look back at us over her shoulder, her arm parallel with a stone parapet on which the date 1510 is written. On a metal salver she carries the greyish-green severed head of a man. The woman’s expression is hard to read – her lips are pressed closed but her eyes glint with moisture and emotion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her identity is not entirely clear – she could be Salome with the head of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judith</a> with the head of Holofernes. The New Testament records how John the Baptist was beheaded at the request of Herod’s wife Herodias, and his head presented to her daughter Salome on a charger. Salome then brought the head to her mother (Matthew 14: 1–11).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The beheading of Holofernes by Judith is told in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO2-0008-0000-0000.htm">apocryphal</a> Book of Judith. Holofernes was an Assyrian general who was about to destroy Judith’s home city of Bethulia. Judith, a beautiful widow, was able to enter Holofernes’s tent because of his desire for her. She got him drunk, decapitated him and took his head away in a sack or basket. Judith was a common subject in Venice at the time as the story of her elimination of a powerful would-be conqueror was politically relevant. Almost every Venetian artist of the time – including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cariani</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Catena</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> – painted the subject.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We have no documentation of the commission to help us identify the woman, but Judith seems the likelier subject given her popularity in Venice. Traditionally the trencher with the head belongs to Salome, whereas Judith usually carries a sack, but not always. Judith tends to be depicted carrying a sword and accompanied by a female servant, but there are exceptions. Ultimately, it may come down to whether we interpret the woman here as heroic (Judith) or villainous (Salome), but even that is problematic as artists interested in psychological truths would not necessarily choose such clear-cut characterisation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In any case, her pose relates to that of Titian’s innovative <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DCU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo</a></span>, also dating from about 1510, whose sitter similarly looks over his shoulder with his elbow protruding towards us. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sebastiano</a> was friendly with the somewhat younger Titian at this point, and it is likely they exchanged compositional ideas. Titian may have been responding to Sebastiano in this case, though it is impossible to say with certainty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting belongs to Sebastiano’s early years in Venice, painted shortly before he left for Rome. The atmospheric rendering of the landscape and the idea of arranging the figure as if turning toward the viewer reveal the influence of his older colleague <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>. The woman’s costume and features closely resemble those of Sebastiano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Woman as a Wise Virgin</span> (National Gallery of Art, Washington) of about 1510. The two pictures are almost identical in scale, suggesting that they may originally have been intended to hang together as a pair or as part of a larger series. It is possible that the painting may be a portrait of a woman in the guise of her namesake, Judith, although the similarity of her features to those of female saints in other paintings by Sebastiano suggests that she may just have been a frequent model. There may have been a growing Venetian market for such compact, intimate psychological studies of biblical and historical figures.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This man with his shrewd and slightly suspicious expression has been identified as Vincenzo Morosini (1511–1588), a powerful Venetian official. He appears in two other paintings in Venice by Tintoretto: a large ceiling canvas in the Doge’s Palace, inscribed with his name and dated 1580; and in the altarpiece for his family chapel in the church of S. Giorgio Maggiore. The National Gallery’s portrait was probably made as a studio model for both paintings. Vincenzo Morosini may have had a special admiration for Tintoretto. In 1648, the art biographer Carlo Ridolfi recorded that Morosini owned a Virgin and Child, a Vulcan, and a picture of Saint Lawrence, all by Tintoretto.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Vincenzo Morosini belonged to one of the oldest, proudest and richest families of Venice. In 1565 the Senate elected him as one of the chief counsellors of the mainland territories of Venice, a very senior post with military and financial responsibilities. In 1571 during the War of Cyprus he was put in charge of the defence of the Venetian Lagoon against the threat of Turkish invasion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1572, he was sent to represent the Venetian state at the Coronation of Pope Gregory XIII. It was probably then that he was made <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Cavaliere</span> of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Stola d‘Oro</span> (Knight of the Golden Stole). This was a special Venetian honour bestowed by the Senate and represented by the golden embroidered band that Morosini wears over his shoulder in this portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Vincenzo was elected to oversee the reconstruction and redecoration of the Doge’s Palace after the fires of 1574 and 1577 and, in 1578, he became one of the nine procurators of Saint Mark’s, which was the most coveted office after that of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">doge</a>. He was buried in the church of S. Giorgio Maggiore in 1588, the monastery of which had been founded by his ancestor, the Blessed Giovanni Morosini, in 982.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tintoretto depicted with sympathy the wrinkled flesh, veined foreheads, thin beards and watery eyes of the old men who ruled Venice. In this portrait study, among his most sensitive, Morosini’s face is carefully composed of many paint layers, while his clothes are rapidly dashed-in. Rough streaks of lead-tin yellow imitate the gold threads on the stole, which is painted on top of the crimson robe. The white fur lining of Morosini’s gown has a pink tinge in places where it was applied over crimson paint that was still wet. As the pale blue-green paint of the hills has become more transparent, the dark underpaint, or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, beneath has appeared. When analysed under a microscope, the ground appears to have been made from a mixture of leftover paint scrapings from the palette for another painting. If the portrait was painted as a studio model for other paintings, its shape and lesser details wouldn’t have mattered so much.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The present shape of this portrait is unusually narrow, and it may have been trimmed along the right-hand side – Morosini’s arm and the landscape have been awkwardly cut. The sky and landscape originally extended further to the left but were then partly concealed by the dark wall Tintoretto painted over them.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three male heads at different stages of life are paired with three animal heads: the elderly bearded man in the red cap with a wolf; the middle-aged man with a lion; and the young man with a dog. A Latin inscription divided to correspond to the three heads is written above them. It translates as: ‘Learning from Yesterday, Today acts prudently lest by his action he spoil Tomorrow.’ The meaning and purpose of this painting has been the subject of much debate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Valeriano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hieroglyphica</span>, published in Venice in 1556, proposed as an emblem of Prudence a serpent with the three heads of a dog, a wolf and a lion. So it may be that the painting is an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegory</a> of Prudence. However, the composition was extensively revised during painting. The animal heads were added at a late stage and are fairly summarily executed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">X-ray images and<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm"> infrared reflectography</a> reveal that the composition was painted over a different figure, seemingly wearing a wide collar and seen from the back looking to the left. Furthermore, alterations were made to the head of the old man at left during its execution. The execution of the heads is of varied finish and quality, with the central one being the most subtle and vibrant. Some observers have seen the intervention of a studio assistant, especially in the head at the right, as well as the animals. Such variety of finish is not unusual for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>, however, and it is hard to imagine why he would have called upon assistants for such an unusual and comparatively simple composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The somewhat inexpressive young man closely resembles the heads added at a late stage, perhaps by an assistant, to Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vendramin Family</a></span>. The painting has generally been considered a late work, but is not inconsistent with Titian’s painting style of the late 1540s, for example the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sisyphus</span> in the Prado Museum, Madrid, and the central head is similar to Titian’s work of that period, notably the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vendramin Family</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is lit from the right, which is unusual in the work of a right-handed artist, suggesting that it may have been made for a specific location, and perhaps meant to be seen from afar. One possibility is that it was intended for the attic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a> of the Camerino (chamber) of Gabriel Vendramin, recorded in contemporary sources as by Titian, where a heraldic composition and symbolic subject would have been appropriate. A triple head but with two young faces is carved on one of the pilasters on the facade of Palazzo Vendramin at S. Fosca in Venice. It is also possible that the painting was made as a cover for a portrait (a Venetian innovation that was popular in north-east Italy from the 1520s), or possibly even as the door of a cupboard.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that the painting may be autobiographical in nature and represent Titian (left), his son Orazio (centre) and nephew Marco Vecellio (right), which would date the picture to the late 1560s. However, although the three heads match the relative ages of the three members of Titian’s family fairly well, they don’t especially look like them.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the most famous paintings in the National Gallery, Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> illustrates a story told by the classical authors Ovid and Catullus. The Cretan princess Ariadne has been abandoned on the Greek island of Naxos by Theseus, whose ship sails away in the distance. Bacchus, god of wine, falls in love at first sight with Ariadne and leaps from his chariot towards her. Later, Bacchus throws Ariadne’s crown into the air, immortalising her as the constellation Corona Borealis, represented by the stars above her head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is one of a celebrated series by Giovanni Bellini, Titian and the Ferrarese artist Dosso Dossi, commissioned for the Camerino d‘Alabastro (Alabaster Room) in the Ducal Palace, Ferrara, by Alfonso I d’Este, Duke of Ferrara. All the pictures, completed from 1514 to 1525, are bacchanals – scenes of hedonism, drinking, music making and lovemaking. Titian shows off his great skill as a colourist, combining in this single picture all of the purest and most vibrant pigments available at that time.</p></div>

The god leaps from his cheetah-drawn chariot; we see him suspended in mid-air in a way only rarely attempted by previous artists. Ariadne is initially afraid of Bacchus but he literally promises her the stars: in one version of the story, he later throws her wedding crown into the air, immortalising her as the constellation Corona Borealis, represented in the painting by the stars above her head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Bacchus and Ariadne is told in different versions by several classical poets, most significantly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a> and Catullus. From Catullus, Titian took the description of Ariadne deserted on the shore of Naxos and the wild train of Bacchus; from Ovid the meeting between the desperate, dishevelled, barefoot heroine and the young god.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is one of a famous series by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a>, Titian and the Ferrarese artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dosso Dossi</a>, commissioned for the Camerino d‘Alabastro (Alabaster Room) in the Ducal Palace, Ferrara, by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfonso I d’Este, Duke of Ferrara</a>. The Duke sent canvases of the right size to Titian in Venice so that the finished paintings would fit exactly in their intended location. It is not certain where exactly the Camerino was in the palace or how the works were arranged within it. However, it was probably a small room, and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> is full of details which could be relished when the painting was examined closely. The landscape, the composition and its direction were calculated by Titian in relation to the other paintings in the room. Dosso’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchanal with Vulcan</span> is now lost; he also contributed ten oblong canvases depicting scenes from Virgil’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aeneid</span> that probably formed a frieze above the main canvases.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scheme was probably devised by a humanist scholar in the service of the Duke of Ferrara, who in around 1510 tried to include <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PIZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a> among the contributors. Bellini’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Feast of the Gods</span> (National Gallery of Art, Washington) for this room is dated 1514 and was later reworked by Titian, after he had finished his three paintings – <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Worship of Venus</span> (Prado, Madrid), <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchanal of the Andrians</span> (Prado, Madrid) were painted 1518–25. Titian began <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> in Venice in 1520 or 1522 and finished it at Ferrara early in 1523.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> was a substitute for a painting on a similar subject which the Duke had commissioned from Raphael, who had died in 1520. Titian self-consciously attempted to emulate, and perhaps outdo, Raphael by drawing inspiration from classical sculpture, and depicting authentically classical costumes. He based the figure tangled in writhing snakes on the recently discovered and instantly famous ancient Roman sculpture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Laocoön</a>, excavated in Rome in 1506 (Vatican Museums, Rome).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian shows off his great skill as a colourist in this picture, combining in a single canvas all the most vibrant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a>  available in Venice at the time. He didn't just use the finest quality pigments, but he also used them in their purest form, unmixed except with white to brighten them. He employed each pigment separately in large areas of colour, keeping them well spaced within the picture, and using them all at full strength to give the painting its rich, jewel-like quality. The ultramarine blue in the sky is the most intense colour and the purest pigment. The strength of blue in the sky varies as it does in nature, being more deeply blue overhead and brighter toward the horizon. The sky blue is differentiated from the slightly greenish blue of the distant landscape, painted with the pigment azurite.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian’s juxtaposition of strongly contrasting colours intensifies them, and his use of oil-rich glazes gives his colours greater depth. Yet the overall effect is harmonious. The different flesh tones – from the pallor of Ariadne to the dark russet of the satyr with the snakes – are picked up across the picture, providing a unifying link. The orange-brown tree in the top right corner is painted in ochre (iron oxide) colours. It was always intended to be rusty brown even though this is not an autumn landscape – the iris, columbine and tender young vine shoots are more typical of late spring or early summer. Titian may have introduced the brown tree to provide a patch of warm contrasting colour at the top corner of the picture, and to continue the strong diagonal sweep through the earthy colours of the bodies down to the brown cheetahs, so drawing our eyes to Ariadne.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He also exploited the textural qualities of the paint itself to add interest and variety to the areas of pure colour. The folds of the pale yellow drapery beneath the urn on which he signed his name are modelled with the brushstrokes rather than painted shadows. Titian became increasingly interested in the textural possibilities of paint, culminating in late works such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Death of Actaeon</a></span>, in which differentiated colour plays a lesser role in the composition than the texture and dynamism of the brushwork.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bacchus and Ariadne</span> had an important influence on European art. The loves of the gods ceased to be a subject chiefly associated with furniture decoration and villa <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> and became the most popular subject for gallery pictures, most notably in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span>, the narrative paintings based on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> of Ovid, which Titian himself began to paint for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Philip II of Spain</a> over 20 years later. <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GYK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Actaeon</a></span>, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H6Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Callisto</a></span> and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Death of Actaeon</a></span> from that series are now in the National Gallery’s collection.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Actaeon is told in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span> (Book III, 138–255). Ovid relates how the noble young hunter, separated from his friends after a day’s hunting, accidentally stumbles upon <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EK4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Diana</a>, chaste goddess of the hunt, bathing in a spring shaded by a natural cave. Titian substitutes a fountain and a ruinous man-made structure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see Actaeon bursting onto the scene and causing consternation among Diana’s virgin nymphs, several of whom hastily seek to cover their nudity. Not all appear dismayed at the intrusion, but rather appear curious or even fascinated; Diana is clearly furious, if perhaps also fascinated. Titian explored the dramatic impact of the moment through a dynamic arrangement of figures, sparkling light, intense colour and animated brushwork. As her handmaid helps cover her with a shift, Diana casts Actaeon a sidelong glance that foretells her cruel act of revenge. Actaeon raises his hands in surprise, as though already half aware of the deadly price he must pay for invading the goddess’s privacy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene is rich in portents of Actaeon’s death: the crumbling architecture is draped with the skins and skull of Diana’s former prey, while in the background is a tiny vignette of the huntress chasing a stag, a foretaste of Actaeon’s destiny as shown in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Death of Actaeon</a></span>. In that work, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> movingly painted the final part of the story in which Actaeon, transformed into a stag by Diana, is torn to apart by his own hounds. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span>, Titian lightens the story’s tragic plot with amusing details: Diana’s lapdog yaps at Actaeon’s hound from the safety of the far bank. The fountain, sinking into the wet ground, appears to lurch under the nymphs‘ weight, and water gushes from a lion mask half-concealed beneath one nymph’s bottom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Significant too is the sense of physical, even social realism Titian brings to the proceedings. Since women of standing would not pose for artists in the nude, Titian hired his models from what we would understand as the working class, often from the large, thriving community of sex workers in Venice. In a sense, he offers the viewer a harem scene that might have brought with it very real, contemporary associations. He includes a Black woman, distinguished from the other nymphs by her state of dress and position as a servant. Venice had a substantial population of sub-Saharan African descent who, while rarely enslaved, often had menial jobs. Moreover, Black servants and pages were considered prestigious in the courts of Northern Italy, a set up that was emulated among the more exclusive courtesans of Venice. Titian seems to be mirroring social reality. Interestingly, the Black woman’s facial features are much more distinctive than the other nymphs: while they are generic beauties of the kind Titian would routinely paint, she seems to be based on a real person that he hired to model for him – the hidden portrait of a real Venetian woman of the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> is one of six large mythological paintings that Titian produced between around 1551 and 1562 for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Philip</a>, King of Spain from 1556, all of which have subjects drawn from classical myth, predominantly the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>. Titian described them with the established term ’<span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span>‘ (poems), which covered precisely that kind of secular narrative painting, but which also revealed his ambition that they be visual equivalents of poetry. This comparison recalls the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">paragone</span>, a debate among artists and theorists in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Italy about the rival claims made for the arts. The Roman author Plutarch’s observation that ’Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is painting that speaks‘ was frequently cited in favour of painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the late 1510s and early 1520s, Titian had created a series of mythological paintings alongside <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dosso Dossi</a> for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfonso I d’Este, Duke of Ferrara</a>, which included <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></span>. This series had a considerable influence on European art in the centuries that followed, helping establish the loves of the gods as a popular subject for secular painting. While Titian had been advised by humanists at Alfonso’s court as to subject matter and format, Philip essentially let him choose freely for the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The first two paintings in the series for Philip, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Danäe</span> (about 1551–3) now in the Wellington Collection, London, and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Adonis</span> (about 1553–4), now in the Prado, Madrid, were variations of pictures Titian had painted before. In 1556, Titian dispatched the next painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Perseus and Andromeda</span> (Wallace Collection, London), and three years after that he sent <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H6Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Callisto</a></span>. The series was completed by <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Rape of Europa</span> (1559–62), now in the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pictures showing Diana were painted together and seem to have been designed to be displayed next to each other as the background landscape as well as the stream in their foreground appear to be continuous between them. However, the light as depicted falls from opposite sides – from the left in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> and from the right in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> – the only <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesia</span> where this is the case This indicates that Titian had a placement between two windows, and so in a very large hall, in mind. It is very unlikely that Philip had initially stipulated a location for the pictures: we know from a letter that Titian intended them all for a single room, but since Philip did not have a fixed residence at the time, the artist was surely just imagining this in the abstract. It is possible, however, that he had received updated information by the time he painted the pictures. In any case, the two paintings have remained together throughout their history.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a letter of 19 June 1559 the artist informed Philip that the two <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span> were finished and that he would await instructions regarding their transport. Titian wrote again on 22 September to confirm that he was about to send the paintings. In this letter he stated that he had worked on them for more than three years, emphasising the exceptional efforts he had expended on the two pictures. He explained that the long time it had taken to paint them was due to ‘the ardent desire that I have to do things that are worthy of Your Majesty, from which it follows that I am never satisfied with my efforts, but seek always with all my industry to polish and to enhance them’. Another letter to the King from the Spanish Ambassador in Venice reveals that the artist had in fact continued to work on the paintings over the course of the summer: ‘Titian will bring to perfection the two paintings of Diana and Callisto [sic] within twenty days because, since they are large and involve a lot of work, he wants to resolve a few little things that others wouldn’t notice.‘</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian’s many revisions to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span>, where he changed his mind during painting, are visible beneath a complex layering of energetic brushwork. Forms are defined by transitions from one colour to another, broken by reflections and mingling in the shadows, rather than by linear contour. Tonal differences are translated directly into colour rather than initially worked out in black and white. The texture of paint and the track of Titian’s gesture enliven the surface of the picture and enhance its emotional charge. The paint surface remains relatively intact.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H6Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Callisto</a></span> was sent to Toledo, where the King was in residence, but was soon moved to the Royal Palace – the Alcázar – in Madrid when Philip moved his court there permanently in May 1561. In 1623, they almost came to Britain when they were packed up as diplomatic gifts for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Charles of England and Scotland</a> (soon to become King Charles I), who was in Madrid attempting to woo the Spanish Infanta. But marriage negotiations foundered and the pictures remained in Madrid. In 1704 they were presented by King Philip V as gifts to the French Ambassador who passed them onto the French regent, Philippe II, the Duc d’Orléans. They first came to Britian in 1793 and eventually ended up in the Bridgewater Collection of the Duke of Sutherland, who lent them on a long-term basis to the National Galleries of Scotland in 1945. They were jointly acquired for the National by the National Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland in 2009 and 2012. They are now displayed at both the National Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery, changing location between London and Edinburgh at intervals of several years.</p></div>

At the goddess’s command Callisto is pinned down by her fellow nymphs and her clothes torn off, exposing her swollen belly. Callisto sprawls on the ground with legs and arms flailing. Titian shows her humiliating exposure and banishment from Diana’s chaste entourage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the next part of the story, never painted by Titian, shamed Callisto is transformed into a bear by Jupiter’s jealous wife <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Juno</a>. Years later, her son with Jupiter, Arcas – now an adolescent – meets her while out hunting. Before he can kill her, Jupiter takes pity and immortalises them as the constellation Ursa Major (the Great Bear) and Arctophylax (the Herdsman) respectively. Still furious, Juno secures with the water-dwelling titans Oceanus and Tethys a promise that the two will never be able to dip below the horizon to slake their thirst in the ocean.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian heightens his drama by his free and expressive brushwork. Voluptuous flesh is suggested in energetic brushstrokes and dabs of paint. The contours of the figures dissolve as the thinnest of dragged brushstrokes are swept over the surface of the canvas, contributing to the sense of dynamism and movement. Trees sway, streaks of golden cloud swirl in the sky and the stone pier tilts disconcertingly. The unicorn pattern of the gold cloth hanging over the tree is worked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a>, with glittering <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a> highlights. The cord at the upper edge of the canopy that secures the fabric to the branches is a simple streak of lead white paint that relies on our eye to give it meaning. Titian made a number of alterations to the group around Callisto in particular during execution, altering poses and removing or adding clothes to individual figures, clearly working to get it just right. Unfortunately, the paint surface is rather damaged in certain areas, especially in the figures of Diana and Callisto themselves, who have lost some of their definition and bodily presence because of paint loss.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> is one of six large mythological paintings that Titian produced between around 1551 and 1562 for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Philip</a>, King of Spain from 1556, all of which have subjects drawn from classical myths, predominantly the Roman poet Ovid’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>.

This comparison recalls the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">paragone</span>, a debate among artists and theorists in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Italy about the rival claims made for the arts. The Roman author Plutarch’s observation that ‘Painting is silent poetry, and poetry is painting that speaks’ was frequently cited in favour of painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> was delivered to Philip along with <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GYK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Actaeon</a></span> in 1559. They were painted together and seem to have been designed to be displayed next to each other as the background landscape as well as the stream in their foreground appear to be continuous between them. However, the light as depicted falls from opposite sides – from the left in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> and from the right in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> – the only <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesia</span> where this is the case. This indicates that Titian had a placement between two windows, and so in a very large hall, in mind. It is very unlikely that Philip had initially stipulated a location for the pictures: we know from a letter that Titian intended them all for a single room, but since Philip did not have a fixed residence at the time, the artist was surely just imagining this in the abstract. It is possible, however, that he had received updated information by the time he painted the two pictures. In any case, they have remained together throughout their history. Around the time he was working on the pair, Titian began another painting associated with them, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Death of Actaeon</a></span>. For some reason, Titian did not sent this painting to the King and it remained in his studio unfinished at his death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Probably in the mid-1560s, some years after <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> was sent to Spain, Titian and his workshop produced a full-sized variant of it (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna). It was common at the time for artists to make copies and variants of successful compositions for other patrons. He also had an engraving made of the composition in 1566 by the Flemish printmaker Cornelis Cort, indicating that he thought it was particularly representative of his powers of invention and suitable for mass circulation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Actaeon</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diana and Callisto</span> was sent to Toledo, where the King was in residence, but was soon moved to the Royal Palace – the Alcázar – in Madrid when Philip moved his court there permanently in May 1561. In 1623, they almost came to Britain when they were packed up as diplomatic gifts for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Charles of England and Scotland</a> (soon to become King Charles I), who was in Madrid attempting to woo the Spanish Infanta. But marriage negotiations foundered and the pictures remained in Madrid. In 1704 they were presented by King Philip V as gifts to the French Ambassador who passed them onto the French regent, Philippe II, the Duc d'Orléans. They first came to Britain in 1793 and eventually ended up in the Bridgewater Collection of the Duke of Sutherland, who lent them on a long-term basis to the National Galleries of Scotland in 1945. They were jointly acquired for the National by the National Gallery and the National Galleries of Scotland in 2009 and 2012. They are now displayed at both the National Gallery and the Scottish National Gallery, changing location between London and Edinburgh at intervals of several years.</p></div>

The focus of the picture is on the interplay of gesture and gaze between Christ and Mary Magdalene. We do not know for whom the picture was painted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the earliest works by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> in the National Gallery’s collection. Its high-key colours and the way the figures are set in a natural landscape echo the style of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>, with whom Titian trained. Titian had already succeeded in uniting figures with the landscape five years earlier in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F7E-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Holy Family with a Shepherd</a></span>, but here he has done something more subtle and sophisticated – the hills, trees and shrubs play a part in the drama. The intersecting lines of the tree and the hillside draw attention to the line of eye contact between the figures. This was an approach that Titian was to develop further in his great altarpiece <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Death of Peter Martyr</span>, completed in 1530 (for SS. Giovanni e Paolo, Venice, but now destroyed), where the trees contribute dynamically to the action.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure of Christ is in a graceful and entirely believable sinuous, twisting pose which reveals Titian’s increasing understanding in this period of the nude and its dynamic potential. This must partly have been due to his study of prints of and drawings after works by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> and Michelangelo, who each in their way made the articulation of the nude figure and the study of antique sculpture central to their practice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The group of buildings on the right appears in reverse in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sacred and Profane Love</span> (Borghese Gallery, Rome), which is dated fairly securely to about 1514, as well as in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sleeping Venus</span> (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden) of around the same time. The rendering of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Noli me Tangere</span>, however, is particularly evocative in its observation of the tumbling mists and play of light across the fields as dawn breaks. We also see the expressive brushwork and interest in the textural possibilities of paint that became the hallmark of Titian’s mature and late styles. The whites of Mary Magdalene’s veil, of Christ’s flowing burial shroud and his loincloth are subtly differentiated, each rendered with dragged brushstrokes of lead white that catch the texture of the painting’s canvas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Noli me Tangere</span> probably also dates to about 1514. X-ray images reveal that Titian made numerous changes to the landscape during painting but he never seems to have shown the empty tomb or Calvary – the hill on which Christ was crucified – included by almost all other artists painting this subject.</p></div>

The title <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Schiavona</span>, meaning ‘the Dalmatian woman’, was given to the picture in the seventeenth century. Dalmatia, on the eastern shores of the Adriatic, was a colony of the Venetian Republic from 1420 to 1797.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We do not know the identity of the sitter, who appears remarkably self-possessed and has a commanding gaze unlike any woman in an earlier European portrait. The very strong sense of realism and physical presence was also new. The picture is original not only because the portrait is three-quarter length and apparently life-sized – it is unusually large for a portrait – but also because it was painted to make an impact from a distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Portraits of women were unusual in Venice and also uncommon in Titian’s work in the early years of the sixteenth century. Those he did paint, with the exception of anonymous beauties, were the wives of great princes. This has led some to believe that this portrait represents Caterina Cornaro (1454–1510), the exiled Queen of Cyprus. However, since she retained her rank in exile she would probably have been portrayed with some evidence that she was a queen, and she does not look much like confirmed portraits of Caterina.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although she wears two thin gold rings set with gems on her left hand, a fine gold chain around her neck and there are gold threads in her silk hair bag, the woman’s costume is not opulent. Her dress is made of dyed wool, and the tiny tufts of blue and red thread at the neckline suggest that it is woven from both colours. It has been painted with a crimson glaze over a pale ultramarine blue. In his handling and treatment of transparent fabrics, such as the veil over the woman’s shoulders, we see the starting point of Titian’s mature style.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her dress and hair are very like those of the mother depicted by Titian in his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Miracle of the Speaking Child</span> for the Scuola del Santo, Padua, dated 1511. It seems likely that he used the same model, suggesting that this portrait may not have been commissioned by a Venetian aristocrat but that it was painted by Titian to encourage such commissions, rather than being a portrait in the traditional sense.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Many changes were made during painting. Originally there was part of a circular window in the upper right of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>. The shape of the parapet was also altered. As the paint of the parapet has become more transparent with age, the woman’s dress has started to show through the raised portion decorated with the profile relief. Evidence of a foreshortened dish and a skull has also been found, although neither was finished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The profile bust portrait, inspired by ancient Roman sculpture and cameos, appears to represent the sitter herself but may commemorate a member of her family. It must have prompted Titian’s more educated public to think of the contemporary debate about the rival claims made for the arts, particularly painting and sculpture. If the painting was not a commissioned portrait but was perhaps made from a model in the sitter’s household, it may always have been intended to prove the powers of painting over those of sculpture. The letters ‘T.V.’ inscribed on the parapet below the woman stand for Tiziano Vecellio (Titian).</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>Following its display in the National Gallery Sainsbury Wing exhibition, <a href="/whats-on/past/renaissance-faces">Renaissance Faces: van Eyck to Titian</a>, Titian’s 'Portrait of a Young Man' returns to the main floor on long-term loan. The loan will strengthen the Gallery’s exceptional collection of portraits by this Venetian master.</p> <p>The subdued and elegant portrait provides a fascinating comparison to the National Gallery’s <a href="/paintings/titian-portrait-of-gerolamo-barbarigo">Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo</a>. Both portraits show the sitter in three-quarter profile behind a parapet. This format may reflect Titian's knowledge of portrait prints by Dürer.</p> <p>The pose enables Titian to show off his skill in painting fabrics. He uses broad brushstrokes and subtle tonal variations to convey the density and sheen of the black silk of the sleeve.</p> <p>The red section of the sleeve is constructed using short, dry strokes to evoke the texture of cut velvet. The young man holds a kidskin glove that he has removed in order to take off his large hat. The fingernails apparent on the empty glove may be the impression of his own, or form part of the design of the glove.</p> <p>The sitter’s face appears luminous against the dark background of a niche. The strip of classical-style relief sculpture on the left enlivens the gloom of the interior and may allude to the sitter’s tastes. It includes a scrolled tablet with a capital 'C' preceded by another letter which is now illegible. Above this are vine scrolls, a beaked serpent's head and a mask which may be clues to the sitter's identity.</p> <p>Titian’s careful observation and sensitive portrayal demonstrate why he was so highly sought after as a portraitist. He used the sitter’s features to convey his personality and mood.</p> <p>The man’s large, pale eyes and pensive gaze suggest that he is contemplative. By contrast his strongly defined eyebrows accentuate his brow, implying intelligence. His long neck conveys his nobility, while his firm jaw is expressive of inner resolve.</p> <p>Although the man’s identity remains a mystery, Titian’s astonishing naturalism eternalised not just his appearance but also his soul.</p></div>

This must be a non-narrative picture intended for private devotion, combining selected elements from the life of Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Several aspects of the composition are also unresolved: it is not clear how the infant Christ is supported as the kneeling woman appears to have no arms. Titian does not seem to have been bothered by this, as he allowed at least two variants of the composition to be made in his workshop; these are now in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence, and the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth. This is an early instance of something that became standard practice in his workshop in subsequent decades.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture may have been the one recorded by Marcantonio Michiel in Andrea Odoni’s collection by 1532, as a ‘picture with Our Lady in a landscape, with Christ and John as children, and Saint [...], by the hand of Titian’, although in the nineteenth century this painting was said to have been signed and dated 1533. In any case, it fits well stylistically with Titian’s work of those years.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is in remarkably good condition, though it has suffered some damage along the top, where part of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> was once folded back over a smaller stretcher. A strip of canvas was at some point added to the left to expand the picture; in Titian’s original arrangement John the Baptist’s right foot was closer the left edge of the picture and the Virgin’s face at its centre.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unusually, Titian chose not to dress the Virgin in the traditional red and blue. This may have been because including red would have meant the blue dress did not harmonise so well with the sky.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around 1551, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>  began producing an ambitious series of large-scale mythological paintings for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Philip – later Philip II – of Spain</a> drawing primarily on the Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>’s epic poem <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>. Titian called these works ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span>’, a term that described narrative subjects taken from classical myth while simultaneously indicating am ambition to create visual equivalents to poetry. During the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a>, the relative merits of painting, poetry and sculpture were the subject of intense debate among artists and theorists in Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Titian’s earlier <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GYK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Diana and Actaeon</a></span>, one of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poesie</span> painted for Philip II in 1556–9, Actaeon disturbs Diana and her nymphs at their secret bathing place. Ovid relates how the goddess splashes water on Actaeon’s face and dares him to tell the world what he has seen. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Death of Actaeon</span> Titian has painted the sequel: Actaeon flees and, stopping to drink at a stream, discovers from his reflection that Diana has turned him into a stag. Titian shows Actaeon in the process of transformation, or metamorphosis – his body is still human but he has a stag’s head. Actaeon finds that he cannot speak and he is beset by his own hounds who tear him to death. The death scene was rare in Italian art and Titian may never have seen another painting of it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is probably the picture Titian referred to in a letter of June 1559 to Philip II, in which he says he hopes to finish two paintings he has started, one of which is described as ‘Actaeon torn apart by his hounds’. Parts of the work may date from the around 1560, even if most of what we see was painted later, probably in the early 1570s. Titian started <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Death of Actaeon</span> when he was in his seventies, was still working on it in his mid-eighties, and it is possible that it was left in his studio at the time of his death in 1576. It was never sent to Spain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The question of whether the painting is finished has been much debated. Although Titian’s materials in the second part of his career remained essentially the same, the ways in which he used them changed considerably, particularly in his final years. He used a much bolder and freer technique, and fully employed the textures of paint and canvas, leaving various parts of his paintings in different states of completion, as we see here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In other late paintings, Titian added <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQN-0008-0000-0000.htm">scumbled</a> touches of deep rose and blue, sometimes applied with his fingers, and it is tempting to think that he might have wanted to do the same here. But <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> change in the sky and other places as well as the dulling of Diana’s bright pink dress caused by dirt and yellowed dirty varnish make the painting seem more monochromatic than it originally was. It is possible that Titian would have wanted to flesh out further the lower body of Actaeon, or add a string to Diana’s bow, but that is far from certain, since in other late paintings he seems to have been happy to leave these details unresolved. The explosion of yellow paint in the foreground he uses to suggest a bush so effectively, is typical of his expressive touch and approach at this stage in his career. It is hard to imagine how anything could have been added to it to make it appear more finished in the traditional sense.</p></div>

The reason for this may be that Titian wished to emphasise the importance of Saint Joseph by making him central to the composition both in terms of action and position. The painting was probably made for a patron who was especially devoted to Saint Joseph, whose cult was strongly promoted in north Italy at this date – altarpieces commissioned by confraternities dedicated to Saint Joseph often give him similar prominence. However, it is more likely that this picture was painted for a domestic setting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Titian’s lack of training in drawing the figure is clear from the size of Saint Joseph’s head in relation to his torso, and the awkward way it is attached to his neck. None of the figures are convincingly articulated, again suggesting that this is a very early work. Titian has disguised the form of the Virgin’s body with billowing folds of drapery. The tender expression of mother and child is emphasised by the soft white linen in which they are encircled. Titian has balanced this in the composition with the shepherd’s rather impractical white shirt and leggings – an indication that he was already thinking of colour and composition together, which would become a hallmark of his mature works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shows the influence of Titian’s older colleague <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>, but the meditative style and atmospheric landscape is more closely related to work by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>, with whom Titian worked around in the years before Giorgione’s death in 1510. The dark, rocky bank with shrubs and weeds silhouetted against the dawn sky is a device often used in Giorgione’s work. However, the figures and drapery style in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Holy Family with a Shepherd</span> are more monumental and bolder in technique than anything Giorgione is known to have painted. The figures are not set against the landscape but are convincingly united with it, a feature that Titian was to develop further in works such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CLR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Noli me Tangere</a></span> of about 1514, in which the landscape plays a part in the drama. It is difficult to be certain about the order in which these very early works by Titian were painted, as his figure style and the confidence of the drawing varies from picture to picture, but this painting shares some similarities with other works painted around 1510–11.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Much of the landscape, especially on the left, has been damaged by rubbing. The shadows of the Virgin’s blue cloak have none of their original depth, making it now appear rather flat. The purple glaze has also been lost from Saint Joseph’s robe, making the highlights appear more prominent.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small painting, made around 1510, shows the Holy Family resting during their journey to Egypt to escape King Herod’s order to kill newborns. Mary sits at the centre, tightly embracing the Christ Child with a mix of motherly tenderness and quite concern. Nearby, Joseph rests leaning on the roots of a tree with downcast expression. The monumental presence of Mary, dressed in vibrant blue and red, and Joseph in bright yellow and deep violet stands out against the loose brushwork and earthy tones of the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A single tree anchors the composition and subtly organizes the figures—a device Titian used in other early works, such as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Noli me tangere</span> (NG270). There, the translucent drapery worn by Mary Magdalene echoes the Virgin’s delicate white veil here, reinforcing the visual continuity in Titian’s early treatment of sacred subjects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the painting’s intimate scale, it is remarkably expansive: a fortified city crowns a mountain in the distance, adding depth and a sense of place. Titian’s early interest in natural settings and human emotion draws on the experiments of his master Giovanni Bellini (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna of the Meadow</span>, NG599) and of Giorgione (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Sunset</span>, NG6307).</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small-scale painting is inspired by an event recalled in the Gospel of Matthew. The Holy Family is shown resting during the Flight into Egypt, undertaken to save the young Christ from the massacre of the newborns ordered by King Herod. Beneath a grove of trees, Joseph and Mary have found a calm place among a cluster of rocks to rest during their arduous journey. At the centre of the scene, the monumental figure of the Virgin tenderly embraces her Child. Her flowing blue cloak spreads across the ground, while the expressive folds of her red garment emphasize her dynamic posture—seated, yet turned protectively toward her naked Son, both to support and shield him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the left, the elderly Joseph leans wearily against the tree roots, his downcast gaze giving him a pensive expressive. Despite the painting’s modest size, the landscape plays a significant role, occupying nearly a third of the image. In the background, a fortified city crowns a hill, its circular architecture echoing features seen in other works by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> around 1510.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted early in his career, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Rest on the Flight into Egypt</span> reflects Titian’s interest in open-air scenes, reminiscent of the natural settings portrayed by his master <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>—such as in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D6D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Madonna of the Meadow</a></span> (about 1500-1505, NG599)—and by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Sunset</a></span>, NG6307). With a loose brushwork, Titian achieves a vibrant atmospheric effect through earthy tones and golden light. The figures stand out in their brightly coloured garments: Joseph in deep violet and bright-yellow, Mary in deep-blue and red, with a delicate white veil that anticipates the translucent drapery worn by the Magdalene in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CLR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Noli me tangere</a></span> (NG270), a hallmark of Titian’s early maturity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject continues Titian’s early exploration of the relationship between the human figure and the landscape. Earlier examples include <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Flight into Egypt</span> (ca. 1506–07, State Hermitage Museum, St. Petersburg), where the figures form a frieze-like procession in the foreground, and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4D-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Holy Family with a Shepherd</a></span> (NG4), painted around the same period. The latter introduces a new monumentality, with weightier figures and a more architectonic composition, reflecting influences from Central Italian artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PIZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Bartolommeo</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Though broadly executed, the figures and landscape in this intimate composition are perfectly integrated, thanks in part to the skilful placement of a tree. This natural element organizes the composition around the Holy Family. It recalls the expressive use of a tree in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Noli me tangere</span>, where it not only separates the Resurrected Christ from Mary Magdalene but also emphasizes her forward motion and his leaning stance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rest on the Flight into Egypt</span>, the figures are absorbed in their thoughts, yet the tender affection between Mother and Child is vividly conveyed through their gestures. Both reach out to embrace, their arms mirroring each other’s movement in a way that would later be echoed in a woodcut by Niccolò Boldrini, where the composition is reimagined as a Venus and Cupid, possibly based on a now-lost work by Titian.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was for a long time in the collection of the Marquess of Bath at Longleat House. Previously, it likely belonged to the 17th century Venetian spice merchant Bartolomeo della Nave. At his death, it was purchased by James Hamilton, 3rd Marquess and 1st Duke of Hamilton whose collection was later acquired by the Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, the Habsburg governor of the Spanish Netherlands. The painting arrived in England in the mid-18th century, where it got purchased in 1878 by John Alexander Thynne, 4th Marquess of Bath.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Pharisees (chief priests) ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans, who rule Palestine. Christ, sensing a trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: ‘They say unto him, Caesar’s.

For 200 years it hung in the Sacristy of Philip’s royal residence and monastery of El Escorial. The subject is rare in art. Titian may have been the first artist to represent it in his painting of about 1516 for Duke Alfonso d'Este in Ferrara (now in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden). That painting served as a cupboard door for the Duke’s collection of ancient coins and medals.</p></div>

They ask Christ whether it is right to pay tax to the Romans, who rule Palestine. Christ, sensing the trap, asks whose likeness and name are on the coinage: ‘They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then he saith unto them, render therefore unto Caesar the things that are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s’ (Matthew 22; Mark 12; Luke 20).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> has painted the Pharisee in the foreground offering the golden coin to Christ, and a scribe wearing spectacles behind him. The subject is rare in art. Titian may have been the first artist to represent it in his famous painting of about 1516 for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duke Alfonso I d'Este of Ferrara</a> (now in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden), which has a broadly similar arrangement. The National Gallery’s picture is almost certainly the painting that Titian described in October 1568 as recently completed and sent to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Philip II of Spain</a>. Titian’s letter suggests that he painted this picture with the King in mind, although he may have chosen the subject himself, as he almost always did in paintings for him. For 200 years it hung in the Sacristy at Philip’s royal residence and monastery of El Escorial.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">X-ray images reveal that Titian made many changes to the picture during painting, particularly to the Pharisee and his clothing, Christ’s head and the coin. The strips of canvas at the left and bottom of the picture were probably added by him rather than at a later date.The painting was worked on over a long period. In its original conception, with its powerful contrasts of characterisation and texture, strong gestures and lighting, it recalls Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ecce Homo</span> (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna), which was completed in 1543.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is in good condition but colour changes and the deterioration of earlier restorations now affect its appearance. The shadows in the folds of Christ’s blue cloak have blanched, altering our sense of its form; the upper part of Christ’s arm no longer appears to project from his body. The distracting dash of white in the drapery beside the thumb of Christ’s raised hand must have once been less bright – a red lake <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSE-0008-0000-0000.htm">glaze</a> painted over it may have faded. The Pharisee’s scarf contains red pigments and must originally have been purple in colour, but the blue pigment used for it, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMS-0008-0000-0000.htm">smalt</a>, has turned brown over time.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is Titian’s largest group portrait. The man in a red robe is probably Gabriel Vendramin (1484–1552). The man holding the altar may be Gabriel’s brother, Andrea Vendramin (1481–1547), and the boys are his seven sons. On the altar is a reliquary of the True Cross that their great-great-grandfather, an earlier Andrea Vendramin, had received on behalf of the Scuola Grande di S. Giovanni Evangelista in 1369. The relic was the confraternity’s greatest treasure and of great importance to the Vendramin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was made for a specific place in the family’s Venetian palace, most likely the central hall. During painting, it was cut down on the left, probably because the patron changed the intended location. The three boys on the far left and two boys on the far right were late additions, possibly painted by an assistant.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>’s largest group portrait. It was recorded in March 1569 in Palazzo Vendramin, Venice, as ‘a large painting in which is depicted the miraculous cross with [...] Andrea Vendramin with his seven sons and messer Gabriel Vendramin together with its gold frame made by the hand of Titian.’ It was probably made for the central hall or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">portego</span> of the family’s palace – a room that exhibited the status of its owner.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Andrea Vendramin (1481–1547) was the oldest son of the Venetian patrician Vendramin family, and his brother Gabriel (1484–1552) was three years younger than him. Their family business was the manufacture, sale and export of soap, and their uncle, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Doge</a> Andrea Vendramin, was one of the richest men in Venice. The children depicted in Titian’s portrait are the sons of Andrea and his wife Lucrezia Pasqualigo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Vendramin family are kneeling before a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4S-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gothic</a> reliquary of silver gilt and rock crystal, the greatest treasure of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Scuola Grande di S. Giovanni Evangelista</a> in Venice. Splinters of wood said to be from Christ’s cross are preserved in its upmost part. Membership of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a> was confined to men, which may be why Andrea Vendramin’s six daughters are not included in the portrait. The relic was very important to the Vendramin because the Guardian of the Scuola who had accepted the relic from the Grand Chancellor of Cyprus on the confraternity’s behalf in 1369 was Andrea Vendramin, the great-great-grandfather of Andrea and Gabriel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The youngest child holding the spaniel, Federigo Vendramin (1535–1583), seems to have been painted from life; he cannot be older than about five, which would suggest a date of about 1541 for that part of the painting. The rest of the painting, however, may well have been finished somewhat later. Lunardo – the youngest adult, in profile – would have been 17 at that time. He died on 5 October 1547 and his father Andrea died in the January of that year, so the portrait was probably painted before then, unless it was posthumous.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The identity of the two older men is a bit of a puzzle. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> reveals that Titian originally planned for the brother with the longer beard to lead the family to the altar in the central position, but switched them around. This would indicate that the man now holding the altar is Andrea, the senior brother and father to the seven sons portrayed, while the man in the red robe is his younger, childless brother Gabriel. The man beside the altar appears much older than the other man, though only three years separated Andrea from Gabriel. However, people age differently and it is not inconceivable that the brothers are rendered accurately. It has been suggested that older man may be the original Andrea Vendramin who was so closely identified with the relic, but that seems too fanciful an idea and unlikely for a portrait this lively.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The best parts of the painting are consistent with Titian’s work of the early 1540s, although the three boys to the left and the last two boys were perhaps painted by an assistant. There seems to have been a change of mind concerning the picture’s width while it was being painted and the canvas was cropped at left. This meant moving Lunardo, whose original position is clear from X-radiographs and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectography</a>. He was first placed lower down and further left; the original position of his head can now be seen appearing through the paint, which has become translucent with age. The three sons in the lower left corner were added subsequently and are an uncomfortable fit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was once owned by the great seventeenth-century painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> who viewed himself as Titian’s artistic heir.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the past, this painting was titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mother and Child</span>, as the figures in this very natural image of a mother breastfeeding show no obvious signs of holiness. However, most women of the time who were wealthy enough to own a painting of this quality would not have nursed their own infants but would have paid women known as ‘wet nurses’ to breastfeed their babies. Paintings of an anonymous mother and child were rare in sixteenth-century Italy, so the subject here is almost certainly the Virgin and Child. The choice of this subject for a painting was significant, and emphasised the Virgin’s humility, her devotion, and the sanctity of her milk.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin gazes at the infant Christ who sits on a white cloth her on lap and feeds from her breast. The naked child is encircled in his mother’s arms and twists away from us. We see very little of his face, just his brown hair and rosy red cheek, which echoes the red fringe of the Virgin’s brown headscarf over her shoulder. Our eye is drawn from the Virgin’s delicate fingers, up the line of her child’s back and to the expression of tenderness on her face, which is the painting’s focus.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> appears to be citing a very similar design by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>, preserved in a large drawing at Casa Buonarotti in Florence, although it is unclear how he would have seen it. His twisting Christ Child and powerfully built Virgin certainly evoke the grandeur and physical strength of his colleague’s figures, but he simultaneously brings a painterly softness and tenderness to his picture. The silvery harmonies of the pastel colours are combined with tremulous brushwork which make the solid forms of the Virgin and Child seem to dissolve into shimmering light. The surface of the painting has been flattened and worn from ironing during the process of relining [glossary:lining] and cleaning before 1962, and the pink lake glazes in the shadows of the Virgin’s lavender-grey dress have faded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The elderly Titian may have kept this painting in his studio and worked on it during the last years of his life.
