        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The parable of the Good Samaritan is told in the Gospel of Luke (10: 30–7). When asked ‘Who is my neighbour?’ – in other words, to whom should I be charitable? – Christ told this story. A man travelling from Jerusalem to Jericho was attacked by thieves who wounded him, stole his clothes and left him half dead. A priest and a Levite travelling by saw him but both ignored him. A Samaritan took pity on the man, ‘bound up his wounds, pouring in oil and wine, and set him on his own beast’ (Luke 10: 34). The Samaritan took the man to an inn and left money for the innkeeper to continue to care for him. Christ said that the Samaritan – the man who had shown mercy – was the injured man’s neighbour. Christ instructed his followers to go and do likewise.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OTS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacopo Bassano</a> may have been the first Italian artist to represent the subject of the Good Samaritan. He did so several times and seems to have made it popular with other Venetian artists, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a>. Here, Bassano shows the moment after the Samaritan has bound the injured man’s wounds; he lifts him up on to his own mule. He has painted two dogs in the foreground licking up the man’s blood. The priest and the Levite can be seen walking away into the hilly landscape in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting would not originally have been so dark. The copper greens in the foliage, and perhaps also in the grass, have darkened making it difficult to see the mule against the trees and rocks behind it. And the stripes in the Samaritan’s scarf have also changed from green to brown. Bassano’s approach of painting large figures close to the front of the picture, in settings with limited spatial depth, is typical of his work during this period and can also be seen in another of his works in the Gallery’s collection, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESM-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Way to Calvary</a></span>. However it is the hazy, atmospheric landscape that makes <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Good Samaritan</span> so impressive.  Bassano captures the grainy quality of the air at first light. Beneath thick grey clouds, the pale light of dawn touches the foothills of the mountains and casts patches of light and dark on the distant fields and hills.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacopo Bassano painted several different compositions and versions of The Good Samaritan. His earliest example of this subject is in the Royal Collection at Hampton Court and dates from 1546–8. The same pewter flask appears in both paintings, and the bald bearded model used here for the Samaritan is used in the Royal Collection painting for the injured traveller.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery’s painting was once owned by the artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir Joshua Reynolds</a> who included it in an exhibition to benefit his servant Ralph. The charitable subject of this painting must have seemed very appropriate to the charitable purpose of Reynolds’s exhibition.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A great throng of figures accompanies <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> on his way to be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucified</a>. Two crosses stand on Calvary, the barren hill in the distance to which the procession wends its way. The men mounted on a horse and mule may represent the priests and Pharisees overseeing the event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ stumbles and falls to his knees beneath the weight of his cross. In front of him is a tree stump, which represents Christ’s sacrifice, and was frequently used by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OTS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bassano</a> in images of Christ. One executioner raises a fist to strike him, while another pulls at a rope tied around his waist. Christ appears calm but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John</a> throws up his hands in anguish. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary</a>, Christ’s mother, wipes her tear-soaked cheek with her blue cloak. Christ turns to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8Y-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Veronica</a>, who holds out her white veil; the image of his face will become miraculously imprinted on it. It is unusual to depict the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUN-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Marys</a> and Saint Veronica pressed so close to Christ’s executioners. Their grief and worry contrasts sharply with the executioner’s cruelty and adds to the drama.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The size and format of this painting – almost a metre and a half square – mean it was almost certainly made as an altarpiece. The subject of The Way to Calvary had been introduced relatively recently as a principal theme for altarpieces. It may have been intended for a chapel dedicated to Saint Veronica, as her encounter with Christ is its main focus. Her name is related to the Latin phrase <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vera icon</span>, which means ‘true image’. Veronica’s veil, the Sudarium, became a major relic, preserved in the Basilica of St Peter’s in Rome, and venerated as a true picture of Christ. The legend of Saint Veronica is not in the Bible and in the second half of the sixteenth century, during the reform of the Church, there were doubts about her cult. It may be that this altarpiece was removed from its church setting during that period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is remarkably well preserved considering its age. Bassano’s earliest mature works – those made once he had fully developed his style and technique – often feature limited spatial depth, and tightly packed figures in active and violent poses. The composition here is radically cropped, with figures on both sides cut and very little sky above, as though Bassano has ‘zoomed in’ on the drama. The composition was inspired by an engraving after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ Carrying the Cross</span> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">‘Lo Spasimo di Sicilia’</span>) (Prado, Madrid). Bassano may also have been influenced in his figure of the Virgin by a woodcut from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Small Passion</span> by the German artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a> of 1509. The Roman soldier’s white scarf, which flutters up curling against the sky, is similar to the restless flourishes of fabric which are typical of Dürer and German Renaissance art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is not listed in Bassano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Libro Secondo</span>, which is surprising as it was the book in which he seems to have recorded all his important commissions. The altarpiece may have been made for his own family chapel or as a special favour. The richness and variety of colour, the complexity of the composition and intensity of expression suggest that it was a painting to which Bassano devoted great attention.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was once in the collection of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0U15-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles II</a> and was listed among the possessions of his Queen, Catherine of Braganza (1638–1705). When she returned to Portugal, she gave it as a bribe to the Lord Chamberlain so he would allow her other paintings to leave England.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young couple sit on the grass in a shady glade. The woman’s hair is unbound, and her dress disturbed to reveal her breasts and leg. In one hand she holds an imaginary musical instrument of four attached reed pipes, with the other she either restrains her lover or encourages him to move the crimson cloak over her lap. His simple robe, which reveals the knotted muscles of his arm and torso, is tied with a braid about his waist. The couple gaze toward a naked, winged cupid who crowns them with a wreath. A wooden water cask lies next to the man’s thigh and a simple wooden instrument – perhaps a recorder – rests above it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of the painting is uncertain.The musical instruments and setting suggest this may be a pastoral scene of a shepherd and his love, but the woman’s clothes are neither plain nor rural. Her chemise (a simple garment worn next to the skin to protect the clothes) is of the finest linen and her dress is made of elaborately patterned silk. Her cloak, possibly of silk velvet, is crimson – the most expensive colour. Her hair, although loosened, could only have been dressed with the help of a maid and a mirror. Mirrors were difficult to make and expensive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This may be a scene from classical mythology or an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegory</a> of love. It has sometimes been interpreted as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Daphnis and Chloe</a>, although the woman’s rich clothes argue against this, as Chloe was raised as a simple shepherdess. The couple may be Venus and Adonis. In which case, the episode would be the goddess Venus trying to restrain her lover, Adonis, from joining the hunt by removing his bow. This subject was popular during the 1550s due to the international success of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Adonis</span> painted for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip II, King of Spain</a>. But Bordone has not included a bow here and the young man doesn't show any interest in going hunting. The subject might be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dido</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FDN-0008-0000-0000.htm">Aeneas</a> who consummated their love while seeking refuge from a storm. However, there is no sign here of a storm. Perhaps the picture is just an erotic image of a nymph (nature goddess) and her lover being crowned by Cupid.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is very minutely finished. One can see tiny brushstrokes of black and red in Cupid’s wing, the separate pale hairs of the man’s beard and threads of fabric at the borders of his garment. Bordone has created a sumptuous colour effect by using two blues on top of each other in both the drapery and the sky. The copper pigments have darkened in the brown leaves at top right and the black areas on the left – they would originally have been greener. Over time, the paint has become slightly translucent in places: we can now see the woman’s dress and cloak through the pipes she holds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Paris Bordone may have painted this work during his stay in France in 1559. He made two other versions of the painting (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; and Cultural Historical Museum, Dubrovnik). The figures in those paintings are identical in size to this one and may have been made from the same <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartoon</a>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of the Purification of the Temple is told in all the Gospels: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> had gone to the Temple to celebrate Passover, but found people selling sheep, oxen and doves for sacrifice. Angry that his father’s house – the house of God – was being used for profit he ‘made a scourge of small cords [and] drove them all out of the temple’ (John 2: 14–16).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">El Greco</a> painted this subject at least four times, but this is one of the most dramatic versions. In the sixteenth century the episode was seen as a parallel to the cleansing of the Catholic Church through the Counter-Reformation, and often featured on medals made for popes. El Greco has used exaggerated gestures and intense colours to reinforce the message of his picture. Christ’s energy and anger is expressed through his movement, his right arm raised ready to strike the man draped in a vibrant yellow cloth. His body twists with this forceful gesture; he looks like a spring ready to uncoil. El Greco has drawn attention to this shape by wrapping a contrasting blue drape around his red tunic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man in yellow mirrors Christ’s pose: he recoils, arching his back and raising his hand to protect his face. This causes a domino effect and the figures behind him lean backwards to avoid being struck or crushed. The painting shows El Greco’s debt to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> art that he saw on his travels to Venice and Rome. Christ’s dynamic pose resembles a figure of Christ in a painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and that of the trader recoiling looks like a figure in an altarpiece by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>. The figures on the other side of Christ are much calmer. They look on at the scene and whisper among themselves.

El Greco spent some time in Venice in 1568 and became very interested in using architecture in his paintings. In our picture the columns are cropped; they indicate a grand architectural setting but El Greco does not describe it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The only details he does include are the sculpted reliefs on the walls either side of the archway. On the left, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam and Eve</a> are being cast out of the Garden of Eden; on the right, we see the attempted sacrifice of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELC-0008-0000-0000.htm">Isaac</a> by his father <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJC-0008-0000-0000.htm">Abraham</a>, following God’s command (it was stopped by an angel). Adam and Eve are a parallel for the sinful traders: they were driven from paradise, God’s garden, just as Christ drives those engaged in commerce from the temple, God’s house. The sacrifice of Isaac symbolises not only obedience to God’s will but also Christ’s own sacrifice at his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>, which was seen to redeem the sin of Adam and Eve.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the Sunday morning after the Crucifixion Mary Magdalene visited Christ’s tomb but found it empty. The story is told in the New Testament (John 20). Mary Magdalene is here identified by the pot of ointment with which she anointed Christ’s feet and by the glimpse of her traditional red dress beneath a silver-grey shawl. The painting may represent Mary visiting Christ’s tomb unaccompanied, or it could be a highly dramatic ‘close-up’ of her meeting with the resurrected Christ, which followed her discovery of the empty tomb.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the background, dawn is breaking over the Venetian lagoon. The stunning effects of dawn light on the woman’s shimmering satin shawl and her intimate glance towards us are what make this painting so atmospheric and captivating. It may be the portrait of a penitent Venetian courtesan in the guise of Mary Magdalene.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A woman turns towards us, her raised right hand covered by her silver-grey satin shawl against which she may have been weeping. We can just see the crimson pleats of her full skirt. Behind her is a ruin with six tall arched recesses with foliage sprouting from the walls. This area, particularly the green of the trees and weeds, seems to have darkened and was probably originally easier to see. Beside her an alabaster vase rests on a ledge in front of a niche. Beyond the wall, dawn is breaking over the Venetian lagoon – a church, bell towers and domes are silhouetted against the horizon. The vase suggests that the figure is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> the penitent prostitute in her traditional red dress, who used a jar of perfumed oil to anoint Christ’s feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The stunning effects of dawn light on the woman’s shimmering satin shawl and her intimate glance towards us are what make this painting so atmospheric and captivating. Paolo Pino in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dialogo della Pittura</span> (Dialogue on Painting) of 1548 said <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PLV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Savoldo</a> made ‘truer pictures of reality than those made by Flemish masters’. Fifteenth-century Flemish painters were particularly known for their powers of meticulous observation and ability to create images of extreme realism.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Often subtleties have been lost in the faces Savoldo painted because he daringly placed them in shadow, and the paint has changed over time. Due to the paint’s increased transparency here the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> now shows through with broad black lines outlining the eyelids and the bags under the woman’s eyes as well as her lips and chin. Her hair may have originally been more visible in the shadow of her shawl.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting may represent Mary Magdalene visiting Christ’s tomb unaccompanied, as described in the Gospel of John: ‘The first day of the week cometh Mary Magdalene early, when it was yet dark, unto the sepulchre...’ However, it might be a highly original dramatic ‘close-up’ of her meeting with the resurrected Christ, which followed her discovery of the empty tomb (John 20: 14–16). Here Mary appears to be illuminated as well as enlightened by the person to whom she turns. It is also possible that this is a portrait of a penitent Venetian courtesan in the guise of Mary Magdalene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are three other known versions of the painting, all slightly different. The Berlin version, which does not include the vase, is the most famous and the only one to be inscribed with Savoldo’s name. The two other painted versions are in the Palazzo Pitti, Florence (Contini-Bonacossi Collection) and the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. In all three, the woman has a yellow shawl unlike in the National Gallery version. The London and Contini-Bonacossi pictures are the closest in design and detail and were probably the last in the series, as they are more dramatic by being set at dawn and gain impact through their close-cropped compositions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was once owned by the grandson of Giovan Paolo Averoldi who commissioned a painting of Saint Jerome from Salvoldo (possibly the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GF3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a></span> now in the National Gallery’s collection).</p></div>

This painting is unusual in relation to earlier examples in that it is painted on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> rather than <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> and it is unusually large – of a size that would suit the side wall of a chapel, or a grand home.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome kneels against a rocky ledge in the wilderness contemplating the crucified <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. The glowing horizon below the ultramarine sky and the dark city in the distance suggests it is dawn or dusk. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PLV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Savoldo</a> was particularly admired for his depictions of these times of day and the dramatic lighting effects they produced. An open book, perhaps Jerome’s Bible, is propped below the Crucifix while another volume rests beneath his knees. The painting is signed on the rock below the open book: ‘Giovanni Girolamo of Brescia, of the Savoldo family, made this.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome’s arm with the rock in his hand appears to swing out of the painting towards us. His pose is dynamic, his body muscular and monumental as he prepares to beat the stone against his chest in penitence. His other hand seems to grasp the air in anticipation of the pain, his arm boldly foreshortened. His unkempt beard and strands of tangled hair stand out against the sky, while in the distance a large church towers over a city. It may be SS. Giovanni e Paolo in Venice, near where Savoldo was living in 1532. The waters of the distant lagoon, painted with the blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> azurite, have probably darkened.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The foreshortening of Jerome’s hand and his bearded head are similar to details in Savoldo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Pesaro Altarpiece</span> (Brera, Milan) of about 1525, as is the landscape with its coastline fringed with buildings and boats. The half-open apprehensive gesture of Jerome’s left hand and his furrowed brow are also found in other paintings by Savoldo of the later 1520s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 28 November 1527 Giovan Paolo Averoldi of Brescia recorded a payment in his personal account book of a ’scudo doro‘ (a gold <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scudo</span>) to Savoldo ’towards the cost of making a Saint Jerome.‘ The payment was made in Venice at the artist’s house and was witnessed by his household. The commission may have been for the National Gallery’s picture, which seems bolder and more monumental than those Savoldo painted in the early 1520s. Savoldo’s second name was Jerome, or ’Girolamo' in Italian, and it is likely he also painted himself as Saint Jerome, and that there is another painting of this subject.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It was recorded in 1648 that the wife of the French Ambassador in Venice had a Saint Jerome praying in the desert as well as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> by Savoldo. These may have been the National Gallery’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Jerome</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></span>. There is a preparatory drawing in black chalk on faded blue paper in the Louvre of the head of Saint Jerome, which is very close to the National Gallery’s painted version.</p></div>

Peter asked Christ to wash his hands and head as well, but Christ said that those who were clean only needed to have their feet washed. He then instructed the disciples to wash one another’s feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is first recorded in the chapel of the Most Holy Sacrament in the Church of S. Trovaso in Venice. This chapel was the responsibility of the Scuola di Santissimo Sacramento (Confraternity of the Most Sacred Sacrament) – which is still active in the city today – and they must have commissioned the painting in about 1575–80. It was the confraternity’s responsibility to accompany the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FO3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Sacrament</a> with a lantern and a bell to the houses of the sick. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tintoretto</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ washing the Feet of the Disciples</span> originally hung on the right of the altar and his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Last Supper</span> (still in the chapel today) hung on the left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tintoretto has set the washing of the feet in a large room with a fire beneath a massive hood and a long table at an angle on the left. There are 12 people present excluding the servant woman, who appears from behind the curtain at the back of the room to the left – this means that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a>, who would betray Christ, must have already left. This is unusual: Judas is normally included in paintings of this episode by other artists as well as by Tintoretto. He might have been left out because he was shown leaving the table in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Last Supper</span>, which Tintoretto may have painted first, in about 1563–4.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ washing the Feet of the Disciples</span> illustrates the need for self-abasement and fraternal love, as well as for purification by Baptism and Penance. Penance was required before receiving communion. The Counter-Reformation Church placed renewed emphasis on the proper preparation for receiving communion, which may explain the popularity of this episode as a subject for chapels of the Sacrament in late sixteenth-century Italy. Such paintings were often commissioned by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternities</a>, which emphasised charitable acts and duty to one another.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ washing the Feet of the Disciples</span> is painted on a black <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> on which Tintoretto first sketched the composition in white paint. Some of this white brush drawing is now visible on the worn surface of the painting, for example in the legs of the torch-bearing disciple at the front left, in Peter’s shoulder, in the architecture in the background and in the brass basin. In many places the paint has darkened and  become translucent, which now makes the blacks more dominant than Tintoretto can have intended. The chequered floor is largely repainted, in a much less subtle manner than that in Tintoretto’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Last Supper</span>, which it probably originally would have resembled.</p></div>

The emphasis of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tintoretto</a>’s painting is on prayers being answered by God – this may be because he was responding to concerns of the Counter Reformation Church about the promotion of a legend to the same status as a properly authenticated miracle or martyrdom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Little is known about Saint George. He was said to have been from Cappadocia in Turkey and his cult was strong throughout the eastern Mediterranean. Legend has it that he was a third-century Roman soldier who objected to Rome’s persecution of Christians, and was imprisoned and tortured by order of Emperor Diocletian but remained true to his faith. He was beheaded at Lydda and his tomb was later brought to Western Europe by the Crusaders. He was especially popular in Venice, where many of his relics were collected, as well as in Genoa and in England (where he is patron saint).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tintoretto devised a daring, dramatically heaving composition, with the horizon set two thirds up the picture and the figures positioned above one another receding obliquely into the distance. He foreshortened the princess’s hand so that it appears to project into our space as she rises from her knees and rushes out of the picture towards us. Her red mantle, floating behind her, emphasises her speed. The painting is alive with energy and action: the headlong movement of the princess and Saint George is continued in the swirling draperies, rushing waters and thunderous clouds pierced by blinding beams of light in the heavens.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> has revealed that every aspect of the composition was drawn with a brush prior to painting, with the exception of God the Father. There were several differences between the drawing and final painting. The towers of the city walls were drawn crowned with domes and the ramparts were lined with spectators. The saint and princess’s heads were positioned slightly differently, but the corpse was in an entirely different pose and in the foreground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the subject of Saint George and the dragon appears in earlier Venetian paintings, it is most common in relief carvings in stone, many of which, mostly dating from the fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries, may still be seen in the city. For Tintoretto, the most important of these would have been the relief commissioned from Pietro da Salò in 1551 for the façade of the Scuola di San Giorgio degli Schiavoni in Venice (the Confraternity of Saint George of the Slavs). He seems to have taken from this relief the idea of showing the horse with both front legs raised directly above the dragon, whose jaw is pierced by Saint George’s lance as it turns its head back.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting has always been recognised as a work by Tintoretto. It has the intense colour of his early works of the late 1540s, such as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Last Supper</span> of 1547 (S. Marcuola, Venice) and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Miracle of Saint Mark</span> of 1548 (Accademia, Venice), but space is created with more assurance and dramatic effect, suggesting it is likely to date from the 1550s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the canvas is rectangular, the painting is arched in shape and must originally have been displayed in a frame with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCA-0008-0000-0000.htm">spandrels</a>, as it is now. The painting’s shape suggests that it was probably intended as an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a>. Most of the earlier representations of the subject had a horizontal format – it must have been the need to compress the narrative into a vertical composition suitable for an altarpiece that gave Tintoretto the novel idea of placing the princess in the foreground and the figures above one another. Even more unusual than this is his decision to place the saint in the middle distance and to make the princess the largest and most prominent figure in the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Due to the distant position of Saint George, the painting may have been deemed unsuitable for public worship as the saint needed to be clearly visible in the foreground as a focus for prayer. If the painting was made as an altarpiece for a church in Venice, it must have been quickly removed from its location or never accepted, as it is not mentioned in contemporary Venetian guidebooks. In his compilation of artists‘ biographies, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Le Maraviglie dell’arte</span> (The Wonders of Art), published in 1642, Ridolfi mentions that Tintoretto made ‘an altarpiece of Saint George killing the dragon’ for the chapter house of SS. Giovanni e Paolo in Venice that had been removed and replaced by a copy. An altarpiece for a chapter house would probably not be as large as those in the main body of the church, so Ridolfi may have been referring to this picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is recorded in a Venetian palace in the seventeenth century, which suggests that it may always have been kept in a private domestic setting, probably a private chapel. In the 1648 edition of his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Maraviglie</span>, Ridolfi adds that the Senator Pietro Correr owned ‘a most delightful sketch of Saint George killing the dragon with the king’s daughter who flees in terror and also including some corpses very finely disposed’. In his rhymed guide to Venetian painting, Boschini in 1660 also describes a painting of the same subject that belonged to the Correr family. Boschini notes that the picture was significantly smaller than the rest of Tintoretto’s paintings, which further suggests that this was the National Gallery’s picture. A preparatory drawing for the dead body survives in the Louvre, Paris.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting has been known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Origin of the Milky Way</span> since about 1857 but ‘The Nursing of Hercules’, as it was known in the eighteenth century, would be a more accurate title. The picture is an<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm"> allegory</a> as well as a mythological narrative. What we see now is only part of the original painting: about a third of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tintoretto</a>’s original canvas was cut off the bottom at some time before 1727.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a> attempted to attain immortality for his son<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENK-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Hercules</a>, whose mother was the mortal Alcmene, by placing him on the breast of his sleeping wife, the goddess <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Juno</a>, to drink her milk. She awoke and the milk that spurted from her breast formed the Milky Way – the haze of which as seen in the bright night sky seems to be suggested by the flowing cloud cover at centre right, behind the eagle. This is the episode depicted in the painting we see today. Juno is accompanied by her attribute of peacocks, while Jupiter is accompanied by an eagle clutching a lightning bolt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A reduced copy of the original painting, probably made in the seventeenth century (private collection, Germany), provides evidence about the missing lower part of the composition. In the lower part of the copy a nude woman reclines on a bank with a large body of water behind her. Roots grow from the ends of the fingers of her right hand, which dangles on the bank; shoots grow from the fingers of her left hand, which she extends upwards. There are large white flowers growing in the right hand corner.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tintoretto probably knew the version of the myth of the Nursing of Hercules written in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Geoponica</span>, a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> textbook on botany – then believed to have been written by the Emperor Constantine – which was translated into Italian and printed in Venice in 1542 and 1549. In that version of the story, the milk from one of Juno’s breasts is said to have fallen down to earth and created the milk-white flowers of the lily. The woman reclining in the now-missing part of the painting is probably Ops, the embodiment of Earth and mother of Juno and Jupiter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject is very rare in art but features on the back of a medal commemorating Tommaso Rangone of about 1560 (one of which is in the British Museum, London). Rangone was closely associated with Tintoretto and commissioned the famous series of paintings from him of the Miracles of Saint Mark for the Scuola Grande di San Marco in Venice. It is likely that <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Origin of the Milky Way</span> is also connected to Rangone in some way and may have been commissioned by him. Rangone was a physician and astrologer; in Alessandro Vittoria’s memorial to him on the facade of the church of S. Giuliano in Venice he is shown holding flowers and between earthly and celestial spheres. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Origin of the Milky Way</span> may reflect some of Rangone’s interests, as stars and flowers were both important to his learning. Tintoretto’s painting may function as an allegory of the physician’s art as practised by Rangone, with special reference to his particular interest in promoting longevity (in the painting Jupiter is attempting to make Hercules immortal), which was central to Rangone’s whole career.</p></div>

When the National Gallery acquired the set of four paintings from Lord Darnley in 1890 this one was held back and eventually given for free as it was considered distasteful for public money to be spent on a painting of a man apparently about to take advantage of a sleeping woman. Lord Darnley wrote: ‘to tell the truth, I am only too glad to have ’le Respect‘, as it is so curiously designated, off my hands.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of a series of four paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a> that concern the trials and rewards of love, although their precise meanings remain unclear. The titles are not original and were given to the paintings in 1727. The compositions are designed to be seen from below, so we know the pictures were intended for a ceiling or a series of ceilings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paintings were recorded in 1648 in the collection of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in Prague. We do not know who commissioned them, but it is most likely that the patron of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HDT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Four Allegories of Love</a></span> was Italian and that the paintings were still in Italy in the 1620s, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> recorded two of the compositions in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Italian sketchbook</span> (British Museum, London). It is possible that the paintings were made for the parallel suites of rooms of a husband and wife, two for the reception room and bedchamber of the man and two for the equivalent rooms of his spouse.This painting and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Respect</a></span> arguably seem particularly intended for a male viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is the most difficult to interpret of the series. A naked man is lying on an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWP-0008-0000-0000.htm">entablature</a> beneath a ruined classical structure, which is decorated with two sculptures, one a limbless <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a> or faun (half-man, half-goat), the other a standing figure holding panpipes in a niche. In classical mythology such creatures were associated with raw sexuality. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> is standing on the man’s chest, beating him with his bow. Its string has snapped, suggesting that love itself is broken. Cupid seems to be chastising the man for his devotion to hedonistic sexuality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A bare-breasted woman looks down on the man as she is lead away by another woman holding an ermine (the white animal has a black-tipped tail). During the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Italian Renaissance</a>, the ermine was an emblem of purity and moderation, as well as of pregnancy and childbirth, as the animal was believed to protect pregnant women. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> employed the ermine as a symbol to express these concepts in his portrait <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lady with an Ermine</span> (National Museum, Kraków).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two women with joined hands may be understood as an illustration of how love encompasses, but is also split between, desire and devotion. The two women may represent earthly and celestial love, holding hands because they are both essential and in synthesis. The stone satyr appears to symbolise bestial love, which is inadmissible in a virtuous life. Although this painting was given the title <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Scorn</span> in 1727, its subject seems to relate to contemporary Neoplatonic ideas about love, as also expressed in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sacred and Profane Love</span> of about 1514 (Galleria Borghese, Rome).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A sheet of figure studies in pen and ink by Veronese for this series of paintings exists in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The five different positions in which the naked man in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Scorn</span> is drawn shows the attention Veronese gave to problems of foreshortening, perhaps using a wax model of the figure to help resolve the pose.</p></div>

They bring gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh, and have journeyed from the East (Matthew 2: 10–12). Caspar, the eldest of the three, has precedence and kneels to kiss Christ’s foot in homage. Melchior also kneels, clasping his hands in prayer as his page takes hold of the gift of frankincense. The heads of the two older kings are particularly fine. Melchior’s features are rendered with quick, deft strokes in a single layer of paint. The head of Caspar is as animated in its bold preliminary modelling as in its decisive white <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>. Balthasar, the young dark-skinned king of Saba, waits to kneel, holding his gift of myrrh.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Angels appear in the sky, along the ray of light that falls on Christ. The dominant diagonal, created by this beam of heavenly light, is countered by the diagonal formed by the adoring figures, with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and Christ Child placed where they intersect. The trussed lambs beside the Virgin are a present from the shepherds, who watch from the ruined building above. The lambs also express the idea that Christ is the ‘Lamb of God,’ who will be sacrificed for the salvation of humankind. The massive classical ruins, against which a lean-to stable has been erected, suggest that the paganism of the past has been superseded by Christianity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was made for the church of S. Silvestro in Venice. It was not an altarpiece, but was placed to the left of the altar of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Joseph</a>. The altar was barely recessed, so the painting did not hang on the side wall of the chapel but in the nave of the church. The practice of completely covering the walls of the nave with painted canvases was not uncommon in Venice during this period – the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">scuole</span> (‘confraternities’) were often the patrons of these pictures. The altar of Saint Joseph was the responsibility of the Scuola di San Giuseppe (Confraternity of Saint Joseph), which probably commissioned this painting. It is therefore surprising that Joseph, positioned behind the Virgin, is not more central in the composition. He may have been placed on the right in anticipation of viewers approaching the painting from the left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition seems to have been very carefully worked out before painting began, as few changes were made. The Virgin’s pose is identical to that in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration of the Kings</span> for S. Corona, Vicenza, although the folds of her garments are different, meaning that both paintings were probably worked up from the same small drawing. The two pictures may have been painted at the same time in Veronese’s workshop. There is a compositional drawing for the National Gallery’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration</span> in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is inscribed on the lowest stone step with the date 1573 in Roman numerals. Veronese completed several other large paintings in 1573, including the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Feast in the House of Levi</span> for SS. Giovanni e Paolo and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna del Rosario</span> for S. Pietro Martire (both now in the Accademia, Venice). While this would suggest that Veronese’s assistants helped execute the work, their contributions are not immediately visible, likely integrated seamlessly into the whole by Paolo.</p></div>

On the eve of the election of a new bishop at Myra, a voice revealed that a pious youth called Nicholas had been divinely chosen and would be the first to appear at the cathedral door in the morning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Veronese depicts the entrance of the cathedral, where the senior bishop consecrates Nicholas, who kneels wearing a robe of emerald green,  flanked by two older priests in white surplices. An angel descends with a bishop’s mitre (hat), stole (scarf-like vestment) and crosier (staff), proving that Nicholas has been chosen by God. The turbans worn by two of the witnesses show the story is taking place in Asia Minor. The consecration of Saint Nicholas is included in cycles of paintings of his life, but this is the only known independent painting of the subject. It seems to have been chosen to illustrate the importance of the call to the priesthood, and of God’s authority vested in a bishop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Nicholas kneels at the lowest point of the deep ‘V’ shape formed by the figures. The brilliant green of his robe is included elsewhere, creating a pattern of colour which, with the repeated rich pink, blue and white, draws our eye around the composition. Tiny dots and brushtrokes of white and yellow suggest the striped gold fabric covering the shoulders of the senior bishop. Streaks of white and grey define the folds and form of the foremost priest’s brightly lit white robe. Veronese paints just enough detail and then allows our eyes to do the rest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Giorgio Vasari</a>, the sixteenth-century artists‘ biographer, highly praised this painting in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lives of the Artists</span>. It was painted for the abbey church of S. Benedetto Po, just south of Mantua, following its reconstruction under the direction of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QGM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giulio Romano</a>. Veronese was commissioned on 27 December 1561 to paint three altarpieces with subjects from the lives of Saint Nicholas, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Anthony Abbot</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>. A transcription of a lost document recording the commission says they were to be painted in the best available colours and specifies the payment the artist was to receive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Veronese received final payment for the altarpieces on 30 March 1562, so he either started before the commission was formally recorded or he worked at incredible speed, the three paintings only taking him three months. The original architectural frames, which may have been designed by Giulio Romano, are lost.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece of Saint Nicholas was taken from the abbey church and sold on the orders of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TO5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Napoleon Bonaparte</a>, when the French general took Mantua in 1797. It was purchased in 1811 by the governors of the ’British Institution for Promoting the Fine Arts in the United Kingdom‘. It was the first old master painting to be acquired by them, and they intended it to adorn a ’future National Gallery'.</p></div>

She dreamed that an angel revealed to her the location of the cross on which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> was crucified and urged her to travel to the Holy Land to find it. She excavated three crosses and, by testing their healing power, was able to identify which was Christ’s cross, known as the True Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a>’s painting, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Helena</a> sits with one foot up on a stone bench in a window alcove, her head resting in her hand, her elbow on the window ledge. As she sleeps, two winged cherubs appear as a vision in the sky carrying the True Cross. The composition is highly unusual in Veronese’s work and the economical way in which it is painted is masterly. The absence of the sumptuous accessories usually favoured by Veronese and of any pattern or detail in Saint Helena’s salmon pink and gold dress allows light to ripple over the softly blended colours like a dream flowing through the sleeping body. The effect has been likened to sunlight gleaming in damp sand on the seashore.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture’s composition was derived from an anonymous print of Saint Helena (British Museum, London), which itself was based on a drawing by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> (Uffizi, Florence). The print probably represents Saint Helena, although Raphael’s drawing may have been intended as someone else – an early inscription identifies it as Danaë. Veronese’s painting differs from the print in its dramatic cropping – Saint Helena fills almost the entire canvas – and the unusual, knotty grouping of angels and the Cross at the top. The cupid on the left and Saint Helena have lost their feet, which suggests that a little of the painted area has been cut off at the top and bottom of the picture, and the deterioration of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMS-0008-0000-0000.htm">smalt</a> has caused the sky to turn from pale blue to yellow-grey.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The limited palette and relative roughness of the brushstrokes may reflect the painting’s original purpose and location. It was probably not intended to be seen at close range, but was clearly designed to be displayed high above the viewer – we can see the underside of Saint Helena’s chin and only sky is visible through the window. It may have been made as one of the outside canvas shutters for a church organ, visible when the organ was not in use. The canvas is of a similar size to Veronese’s shutters for the organ at S. Giacomo on the Venetian island of Murano. Organ shutters often showed pairs of saints, one on each shutter. The most likely companion saint for Helena would have been her son Constantine. Their images are commonly found in Franciscan churches dedicated to the True Cross (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Santa Croce</span> in Italian).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery’s painting may have been the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Helena</span> that was listed in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>’s collection in Antwerp after his death in 1640.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After defeating King Darius III of Persia, who fled after the Battle of Issus in 330 BC, Alexander the Great, the 23-year-old Macedonian emperor, visited Darius’s distraught family. Dressed in a blue ermine-lined cloak, Darius’s mother Sisigambis kneels before Alexander’s friend Hephaestion, mistaking him for the victor. Hephaestion, in armour and wearing an orange cloak, seems literally taken aback and points to himself in surprise. Alexander comforts Sisigambis by graciously observing that Hephaestion is ‘another Alexander’ – so close a friend that they are ‘as one’. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a> has used hand gestures to indicate this dialogue between Alexander and Sisigambis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sisigambis is accompanied by Darius’s wife – and sister – Stateira, and their two young daughters dressed in matching robes. The family are wearing Venetian dress of the 1560s and Hephaestion wears Italian plate armour of about 1560–90, but Veronese has combined these contemporary elements with exotic details and imaginative archaeological features. Alexander wears a costume of deep rose and his armour is derived from antique sculpture, although his chain mail and sword are based on sixteenth-century examples. Echoing contemporary buildings by the architect <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TT7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Palladio</a> (1508–1580) in Verona, the architectural backdrop is fashioned like a theatre set, while the low horizon recalls the experience of seeing a stage play from the front row.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sisigambis gestures to Stateira, as does the man behind her, perhaps calling on Alexander to be merciful to Darius’s family. The elder daughter, also named Stateira, carries her mother’s crown on her arm and Darius’s young son, dressed in red, shelters beside his grandmother. The huge horse towering above the figures at the far right is probably intended to represent Bucephalus, Alexander’s famous charger. Below the horse, a page boy leaning on a shield has an imperial eagle – the emblem of the Holy Roman Emperor – on the back of his doublet, and seems to be peering round the warriors' legs at Darius’s son.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the family of Darius were Alexander’s captives, he received them nobly and insisted that they all be treated as royalty and retain their finery. When Darius died he declared that the gods would reward Alexander for the kindness he had shown to his mother, wife and children. The Roman writer Plutarch mentions that Darius’s daughter, Stateira, eventually married Alexander and his younger daughter married Hephaestion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Plutarch’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Parallel Lives</span> could have been Veronese’s source for this episode, but that account does not really accord with what is shown in the painting. A more likely source is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Factorum et Dictorum Memorabilium</span> by Valerius Maximus, which was readily available in Italian with various editions printed in Venice from 1504 to 1537.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that the painting was commissioned by the Venetian Pisani family, who continued to own it until it was purchased in 1857 by the National Gallery. The original owner was probably Francesco Pisani, who died in 1567. He was the son of a prosperous banker and lived in a splendid villa built for him by Andrea Palladio and adorned with sculpture by Alessandro Vittoria (1525–1608), which stands just outside the walls of Montagnana on what was then the Venetian mainland. Francesco Pisani may have used his influence in 1555 to obtain for Veronese the commission for the high altarpiece of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> for the Cathedral of Montagnana, as the agreement records that it was signed in his villa. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Family of Darius</span> may have been made for the Pisani villa at Montagnana – it was definitely in the villa when Francesco Pisani died in 1567 as his widow was accused of attempting to remove it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has often been assumed that <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Family of Darius</span> is a glorified Pisani family portrait, but the faces reappear in other unrelated paintings by Veronese, suggesting that they were types he used for different characters in various pictures. Even if the Pisani are not represented here, it is likely that the subject of the painting had special associations for them. It was a familiar subject, commissioned by at least two other prominent Venetian families during the same period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Few of Veronese’s large paintings are likely to have been painted entirely by him; they would have been completed by studio assistants. However, the superior quality of this painting suggests he worked on every part of it. The fact that the original design was altered to a degree which is unusual in Veronese’s large paintings also suggests he himself was wholly responsible for its execution. Traces of preliminary drawing, probably in charcoal, can be seen in the thinly painted background figures and in the architecture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the painting is in good condition, the blue pigment <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMS-0008-0000-0000.htm">smalt</a> used for the sky has deteriorated to grey. It is likely, however, that the sky was always intended to be a pale blue with clouds. Changes over time to the paint have meant that the architecture has become translucent in parts, as have the horses and figures on the balustrade. The figures were surely meant to be pale, but probably not as pale as they are now.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The celebrated German writer Goethe went to Venice in 1786, and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Family of Darius</span> was the only painting that he described in the account he gave of his visit in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Italian Journey</span>. It was probably the most celebrated privately owned picture in the entire city, and it remains one of Veronese’s most impressive paintings.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of a series of four paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Veronese</a> that concern the trials and rewards of love, although their precise meanings remain unclear. The titles are not original and were given to the paintings in 1727. The compositions are designed to be seen from below, so we know the pictures were intended for a ceiling or a series of ceilings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paintings are recorded in 1648 in the collection of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in Prague. We do not know who commissioned them, but it is most likely that the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HDT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Four Allegories of Love</a></span> were made for an Italian patron and were still in Italy in the 1620s, when Van Dyck recorded two of the compositions in his  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Italian sketchbook</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible that the series of paintings was made for the parallel suites of rooms of a husband and wife in a Venetian palace, two of the paintings for the reception room and bedchamber of the man and two for the equivalent rooms of his spouse. This painting and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Happy Union</a></span> seem particularly intended for a female viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Unfaithfulness</span>, a naked woman with her back to the viewer sits between two clothed men, exchanging a letter with one of them. It is not clear whether she is giving the letter to him or he is passing it to her. It is inscribed with red letters which appear to spell either ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">che / uno possede</span>‘, meaning ‘which one person possesses’, or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ch.. / mi. p(ossede)</span>, meaning ’which/who possesses me' – the dots indicating illegible letters. The inscription may mean ‘she who has one man (should be satisfied)’ or possibly ‘she who has one lover (will always want another)’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A child, similar to that in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Happy Union</span>, holds the woman by the leg, while <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> plays music on a clavichord. The child’s pose echoes that of the woman. Cupid stands beside the courtly young man with whom the woman is exchanging the note. The woman is physically held by the child and the man on the right, although her attention is drawn to the music-making Cupid, and her other hand is joined with that of her lover on the left, around the letter that passes between them. The sinuous shape of her arms is echoed in the twisting tree trunks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting seems intended for a female audience and to perhaps pair with <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Happy Union</span>, although none of the men are the same. Even if this picture represents indecision in courtship rather than marital deceit, there is nothing within the picture to express disapproval.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The green drapery over the woman’s thigh and buttocks may have been added for the sake of decency, weakening the composition. The blue pigment <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMS-0008-0000-0000.htm">smalt</a> used for the sky in all four paintings has turned grey. The russet-coloured jacket and boots of the bearded lover have lost much of the original modelling on account of the degraded pigments, and the colour of Cupid’s wings has changed.</p></div>
