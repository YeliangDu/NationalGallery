        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delacroix painted this portrait of fellow artist, Louis-Auguste Schwiter (1805–1899), in the early years of their lifelong friendship. Not only was this Delacroix’s first full-length portrait, but it also reveals the close attention he paid to work by British artists such as Thomas Gainsborough (1727–1788) and Thomas Lawrence (1769–1830). These portraits marked a departure from a more formal, heroic style of portraiture whose primary function was often the display of wealth and social status. The use of outdoor locations, such as parks and woodlands, was an important aspect of this new portraiture and Delacroix makes effective use of the dark sky and foliage to highlight areas of bright colour and, perhaps, to hint at Schwiter’s personality. Delacroix submitted the portrait to the Salon of 1827, but it was rejected. It was later bought by Edgar Degas (1834–1917) for his own collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Louis-Auguste Schwiter (1805–1899) was an artist who exhibited regularly at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paris Salon</a> from 1831. He later inherited the title of baron. His friendship with Delacroix, seven years his senior and under whom he may have trained, lasted until Delacroix’s death in 1863. Significantly for this painting, both shared an enthusiasm for England and they may have travelled together to London in 1825, the year before Delacroix began work on the portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">French interest in English culture and history was at its peak in the 1820s and 1830s – a fine example of this is Paul Delaroche’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSG-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Execution of Lady Jane Grey</a>. The cultivation of English style is evident both in Schwiter’s clothes and in Delacroix’s emulation of contemporary English portraiture. British artists often exhibited at the Paris Salon and Delacroix would also have seen examples while visiting London. Delacroix especially admired the portraitist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0H-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir Thomas Lawrence</a> (1769–1830). He wrote enthusiastically in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Journal</span> of portraits Lawrence had exhibited at the Salon of 1824, and met him in England the following year.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For this portrait, Delacroix adopted Lawrence’s preference for presenting elegantly dressed figures within a parkland setting. He also sought to recreate what he saw as Lawrence’s ability to capture ‘the most delicate shade of melancholy or of gaiety.’ Although not an overtly melancholic portrait, the sombre evening sky, setting sun and dark landscape – partly painted by the landscape painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QFG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Huet</a> (1803–1869)  – contribute to the effect of approaching dusk. Schwiter himself is depicted as a pensive and somewhat guarded young man who appraises us as much as we do him. Holding his top hat, with its flash of bright red lining, he wears a simple but fashionable black frock coat, which sets off his cream gloves and brilliant white cravat. Pale, elegant, and slim, he is a distinctly modern figure with a hint of the dandy about him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delacroix was also an enthusiastic admirer of the English poet, Lord Byron (1788–1824), whose poems provided subjects for many of his paintings and prints. In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Journal</span> of 1824 he extensively praised Byron’s ability to express the sense of isolation that can accompany genius. Delacroix’s identification with ‘the poet who lives in isolation’ is perhaps projected onto Schwiter. As they shared similar physical features, the painting may in part be viewed as a self portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As his first full-length portrait, this painting was an important step for Delacroix. But despite his ambitions for it, the painting was rejected for the Salon of 1827. The reason for this is not known, but dissatisfaction with the perspective of the balustrade may be the explanation; Delacroix later reworked this section. The painting was eventually bought by Edgar Degas (1834–1917) in 1895 for his own private collection, a few years after Schwiter’s death.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Many portraits were painted of Madame de Pompadour (1721–1764), the mistress of Louis XV and one of the most famous figures of her time. Although the grandest, this portrait by Drouais is also the most naturalistic image of her, which avoids the rigid formality or mythological trappings of much court portraiture. Instead, we encounter Madame de Pompadour as a homely woman accompanied by one of her dogs, a black King Charles spaniel, in her salon (a living or drawing room) at her apartment in Versailles as she works at a tapestry (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">tambour</span>) frame. Rather than the international celebrity she had become by the end of her life, when this portrait was painted, she is presented as an almost matronly figure embodying bourgeois virtue and industry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Madame de Pompadour was born plain Mademoiselle Poisson. In 1741 she married Charles-Guillaume Le Normant des Etioles, the nephew of her mother’s rich lover. She began to entertain artists and intellectuals at her salon, where she attracted the attention of Louis XV. After separating from her husband, she was ennobled to marquise and moved into Versailles. Although regarded as an upstart Parisian bourgeois by her rivals and enemies, she retained the king’s favour, and continued to live at Versailles even after she had ceased to be his mistress by 1751.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The marquise was an important patron of the fine, applied and performing arts. She particularly supported the artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PA0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Boucher</a> and protected the porcelain factory at Vincennes, transferring it to Sèvres, near one of her houses, where it flourished. Visitors to her salon in Paris had included the writer Voltaire, the most famous of the liberal <span class="dokuwiki_italic">philosophes</span> (intellectuals). She remained sympathetic to Enlightenment thinking and maintained an extensive library. A leader of taste in matters of fashion and style, particularly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Rococo</a> style, the marquise also had some influence in government and public affairs, and supported the king’s extensive building projects. She was the subject of numerous biographies, and remains one of the most well-known historical figures of the eighteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Close examination reveals that the portrait, which was begun in April 1763 but not completed until May 1764 (a month after the marquise’s death aged 43), is in fact made up of two canvases. A smaller canvas – including the head, shoulders and right forearm – has been incorporated into the larger full-length portrait. It was not unusual, particularly with important sitters, for artists to work on a smaller portrait from life and to complete the rest in the studio with a model using the sitter’s clothes and accessories. It is not a court dress with unwieldy wide hoops, but a gown worn over small side hoops with a train gathered behind consisting of an overdress, petticoat and stomacher. The sumptuous fabric is possibly painted silk but is more likely a hand-painted floral pattern chintz garnished with French needle lace. The choice of material was itself a patriotic statement of support for the thriving industry in France of printing on cotton cloth, sourced from the French West Indies, which by the 1760s rivalled England’s production. Patriotic sentiment – and self-interest – may also have prompted the commissioning of the portrait to mark the ending of the Seven Years War (1756–63). Madame de Pompadour had helped promote the Franco-Austrian alliance, which had proved disastrous for France. Drouais’s portrait may have been intended to project an apolitical image of the marquise as a benign and respectable lady of arts and letters in order to downplay her implication in French military defeat and her identity as the king’s former mistress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the right in the picture, there is an elaborate worktable (with Sèvres plaques), which has a folio of drawings or engravings and a mandolin resting against it. These objects, and the books in the bookcase, testify to the marquise’s interest in the arts. However, it is the tapestry frame that, with the dress, is the most distinctive object on view. In his memoirs, one courtier later noted that in 1756 the marquise stopped receiving visitors in her dressing room but instead received them while at her tapestry-frame: ‘she went from make-up to making.’ Embroidery was regarded as a virtuous activity for women and it was not uncommon for them to be portrayed engaged in it. Most tambour frames were circular – the word comes from the French <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tambour</span> (drum) – but wider rectangular frames, such as this one, allowed for larger pieces that could be stretched and wound on a roller as the work progressed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Placing Madame de Pompadour at her tambour holding a hooked needle as she works on her embroidery creates a domesticated, even homely, image of respectability and relative informality. Although no longer a young woman, and stoically enduring deteriorating health, the marquise looks up from her embroidery to calmly acknowledge us with, as one admirer described, her ‘wonderful complexion … and those eyes not so very big, but the brightest, wittiest and most sparkling.’ But the tambour frame also creates a series of horizontals and verticals that provide a solid base supporting the triangle of her upper torso and head, which we see from slightly below. Almost exactly a century later, Ingres was to use a similar elevated pyramidal structure to create a powerful but discreet effect of social status in his portrait of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D8J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Madame Moitessier</a></span>, a picture also filled with the display of a luxurious dress and objects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was well-received. One commentator who saw it in Paris at the Palais de Tuileries in August 1764 noted: ‘The resemblance is most striking, and the picture’s composition is as opulent as it is well understood.’ For another, Drouais was ‘the only man who knows how to paint women … I am persuaded that all our women will henceforth wish to be painted by Drouais.’</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gerrit van Honthorst had an international reputation for attracting high-status clients. After working in Rome, he was invited to England in 1628 by Charles I and painted several royal portraits before returning to live mainly in The Hague. In Holland he became a favourite of Charles’ sister Elizabeth Stuart, depicted here. She was married to Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and in 1619 they were also crowned King and Queen of Bohemia. Deposed in the winter of 1620, they went into exile in The Hague, where she became known as the ‘Winter Queen’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This near life-size portrait represents a new type of formal picture of Elizabeth. Made in 1642, ten years after her husband’s death, it was the first time she was depicted in the open air. She wears black for mourning, a state confirmed by the black ribbon on her right arm. Her jewellery is a combination of enormous pearls and black precious stones.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If it weren’t for the inscription on the balustrade you might not realise that this is a portrait of a queen. This lettering was actually added to the picture at a later date; the sitter’s contemporaries would have gauged her status and nobility from the portrait’s dimensions (near life-size) and her sumptuous lace and silks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">They would have also realised that she was in mourning, a state suggested by her black dress and confirmed by the black ribbon on her right arm. Her jewellery is astonishingly impressive: a combination of enormous pearls and black precious stones. The earrings had been given to her by her husband, who had died ten years previously. He was Frederick V, Elector Palatine, and she is Elizabeth Stuart, the daughter of James I of England.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She moved to Heidelberg with Frederick when they married in 1613. He was elected King of Bohemia in November 1619 and they then moved to Prague. But the following November he was defeated by a rival claimant, the Holy Roman Emperor, Ferdinand II. Frederick and Elizabeth went into exile in Holland and Elizabeth became known as the ‘Winter Queen’ (her brief reign began and ended in that season).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was made in 1642, when Elizabeth was 46 years old. In the same year, civil war broke out in England – it would eventually lead to the execution of her brother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles I</a> – and her sister-in-law Queen Henrietta Maria crossed the Channel to join her in exile in The Hague. Elizabeth eventually returned to England in 1661 after the restoration of her nephew, Charles II. But she died just nine months after her return.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q04-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit van Honthorst</a> had an international reputation for attracting high-status clients. After working in Rome, he was invited to England in 1628 by Charles I and painted several royal portraits before returning to live mainly in The Hague as painter to the Stadholder. He was also one of the artists most favoured by Elizabeth Stuart and he made numerous portraits of Frederick, Elizabeth and their children.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This full-length, near life-size example represents a new type of formal picture of Elizabeth. It shows her with a new hairstyle – the first time she had appeared without a fringe – and it was also the first time she had been depicted in the open air. The outdoor setting creates a certain grandeur, with the landscape and winding river receding into the far distance. The rosebush and what seems to be an oak tree frame her head and shoulders, and the stone balustrade and chequerboard pavement create a sort of platform in the foreground which gives the impression that she is sharing the same space as the viewer. The dog may be a symbol of fidelity as well as a portrait of a favourite pet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery also owns portraits of two of Elizabeth’s sons – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Charles Louis, Count Palatine</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Prince Rupert, Count Palatine</a></span>, both from the studio of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> – which usually hang on either side of this painting.</p></div>

In 1792, he was made Painter in Ordinary to King George III, and, with his knighthood in 1815 and appointment as President of the Royal Academy from 1820, Lawrence went on to become the unchallenged heir to the British portrait painters, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Thomas Gainsborough</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Joshua Reynolds</a>, and the revered seventeenth-century Flemish artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a>. Like them, he gained a lasting reputation for sensitive portraits of children and young adults. When <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Red Boy</span> was first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1825, critics commented that the painting even exceeded Reynolds’ reputation in the field, with its ‘simple action and sweet expression of infantile nature’. Lawrence may have been inspired by the works of Lord Bryon and by William Wordsworth’s poem <span class="dokuwiki_italic">There was a Boy</span> (1798), or it may allude to one of Lawrence’s own poems: ‘Proceed, dear boy, and climb the hill,/ Enjoy the morning of thy time/ And all the rocks of future life/ As cheerful and as active climb.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sitting on a promontory overlooking a moonlit sea, Lawrence portrays Lambton as a child wanderer, lost in contemplation of the sublime power of nature. The flowers opening at his side symbolise his young age. He is at the beginning of his journey through life, though this was cut short - he died of tuberculosis aged only thirteen. The poetic references of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Red Boy</span> were picked up by people who saw the painting when it was exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1827. About thirty years later the French art critic Théophile Gautier spoke of Lambton’s ‘pearly visage so sombre and clear it conjures the look of the young Byron; that precocious dreamer astonished many Parisians.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting’s nickname, ‘The Red Boy’, reflects the trend during the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries to give portraits of children titles that included the painting’s dominant colour. The most famous example of this is Gainsborough’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Blue Boy</span> of 1770 (The Huntington Art Museum, San Marino) which is now thought to be a portrait of the artist’s nephew, Gainsborough Dupont. Lawrence’s early portrait of Sarah Goodin Moulton (1794, The Huntington Art Museum, San Marino) has long been known as ‘Pinkie’, her family nickname. After the sale of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Blue Boy</span> in 1922, the Illustrated London News published reproductions of ‘Sir Thomas Lawrence’s equally charming portrait which we have named ‘The Red Boy’’. Lawrence’s portrait attracted further attention thanks to a popular story that Lambton’s clothes had originally been painted yellow. Unlike Gainsborough’s sitter, who wears a seventeenth-century ‘Van Dyck’ costume, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Red Boy</span> is dressed in loose-fitting clothes; the contemporary fashion for children. Several of Lawrence’s young sitters wear these red velvet ‘skeleton suits’ which were roomier and better for playing outdoors and which, by 1800, had replaced Van Dyck dress for the children of wealthy families.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The gilded frame is original to the painting and was selected by Lawrence from the frame maker George Morant. This type of frame is often referred to as a Morant frame or a Lawrence frame.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Eva Gonzalès (1847–1883) was the daughter of the novelist, playwright and journalist Emmanuel Gonzalès. Having trained with the society portraitist Charles Chaplin, she was introduced to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> by the artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfred Stevens</a> and became his only formal pupil. Unlike <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QHK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Berthe Morisot</a>, who regarded her as a rival for Manet’s attention and advice, Eva publicly declared herself to be his pupil. She was a successful artist, whose work had similarities with Manet’s Spanish period, and she was a regular exhibitor at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait was painted in Manet’s studio at 81 rue Guyot, Paris, and was probably started in the summer of 1869. Completion was slow and involved numerous sittings, but it was finally finished by 12 March 1870. Shown at the Salon the same year with the title <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mlle E.G.</span>, the portrait received a mixed reception, although even Morisot praised it, noting ‘Manet has never done anything as good as his portrait of Mademoiselle Gonzalès’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Manet had painted other artists (both men and women), but this portrait is unusual in that it shows Eva actually painting at her easel, rather than as a contemporary bourgeoise and with no visible reference to her profession. A half-rolled <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">print</a> bearing Manet’s signature lies on the floor, a reminder of his role as her teacher. Gonzalès puts the finishing touches to a flower painting that is already framed. The work is a copy after an etching by the flower painter Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer (1636–1699), painted in the style of the  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Rococo</a>. It is quite unlike the white peony on the ground, near the hem of her dress, the shape and creamy texture of which are similar to earlier flower pieces by Manet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With her right arm stretched out rather stiffly and her palette seeming to balance on her left hand, Gonzalès appears to merely dab at the canvas (perhaps just retouching a detail), in contrast to Manet’s technique of applying paint thickly. Her head is turned slightly towards us, although she does not directly engage with us. Her pose, along with her white dress and the fluidity of the brushstrokes with which it is painted, recall women’s self portraits of the eighteenth century, particularly those of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">French: Vigée Le Brun, Elisabeth Louise (1755–1842)</a> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self-Portrait</span>, 1790, Gallerie degli Uffizi) and Adélaïde Labille-Guiard (1749–1803) (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Self-Portrait with Two Pupils, Marie Gabrielle Capet (1761–1818) and Marie Marguerite Carraux de Rosemond (1765–1780))</span>, 1785, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. These works, where artists would placed themselves at the easel, dressed in beautiful, often white gowns, proclaimed their success in their chosen profession.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While this painting alludes to these self portraits, Gonzalès’s expensive flowing white dress is an impractical choice for someone painting, but it fills the composition. Its brightness is heightened by the dark background so that it becomes a source of illumination in its own right. Manet’s appreciation of white may also have been inspired by Whistler’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Little White Girl</span>, subsequently titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Symphony in White No 1: The White Girl</span> (Washington, National Gallery of Art), which had been exhibited at the 1863 Salon des Refusés.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this portrait, the recently widowed Catherine-Thérèse de Goyon de Matignon-Thorigny, Marquise de Seignelay (1662–1699) is depicted as the sea-goddess Thetis. Pierre Mignard expresses this through the coral, reeds and pearls woven in her hair and the scallop shell at her feet. Her sumptuous robe is painted using ultramarine, a highly expensive blue pigment, as a show of her fortune and power. Her eight-year-old son Marie-Jean Baptiste (1683–1712) is dressed as the Greek hero Achilles – Thetis’ son by the mortal Peleus (Pelée in French).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the Marquise’s side, Cupid offers up a shell cup overflowing with pearls and coral. Along with the exotic shells at her feet, these are used to celebrate her husband’s career in the French royal navy and the wealth gained through his exploits in the French colonies of the West Indies. It has recently been suggested that Mignard situates the figures on the shores of Martinique, an island in the West Indian ocean which was purchased for the French crown by the late Marquis’ father in 1664. The smoking volcano in the background – Mount Pelée – is an ingenious reference to Catherine-Thérèse’s deceased husband.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this imposing portrait, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QC1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pierre Mignard</a> transforms Catherine-Thérèse de Goyon de Matignon-Thorigny, the Marquise de Seignelay (1662–1699), into the sea-goddess Thetis. A luminous blue robe cascades in folds over her gold-embroidered gown. The generous use of ultramarine – an expensive and high-quality blue pigment – was unusual for the period. It, like the portrait, is a deliberate display of wealth, status and power.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the Marquise’s side stands a young boy dressed as Achilles, who, according to Greek legend, was the son of Thetis and the mortal Peleus and the greatest warrior of the Trojan War. He wears ornate armour and holds a spear, with a shield and helmet lying at his feet. This is likely Catherine-Thérèse’s eldest son, Marie-Jean Baptiste (1683 – 1712) who was eight years old at the time. This is a striking choice because Achilles is usually depicted as a mature warrior. It has been suggested that the winged <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> might be her youngest son, Théodore-Alexandre (1690? - 1695?), although this seems unlikely given his nudity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Catherine-Thérèse was the widow of Jean-Baptiste-Antoine Colbert (1651–1690), the Marquis de Seignelay, who died a year before this portrait was painted. The Marquis had been appointed Secretary of State for the Navy upon the death of his father, Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1685), who held the position before him. Due to their naval profession, the Colbert family had strong ties to the French colonies in the Americas. Both father and son were responsible for drafting the Code Noir (Black Code, 1685), which regulated the commerce and discipline of enslaved people in the French colonial empire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although once thought to depict a Mediterranean volcano, perhaps Vesuvius, the background of this portrait has recently been identified as Martinique, an island in the West Indian ocean, which was purchased for the French crown by the Marquise’s father-in-law in 1664. The wealth of the island lay in sugar production. This was exploited by the French who used enslaved labour from the Senegalese coast to work the plantations. As the source of Seignelay family’s wealth and power, Martinique would have been deemed a fitting location for the figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The topographical accuracy of the landscape in the background suggests that Mignard worked from contemporary engravings or sketches to complete the scene. The volcano has been identified as Mount Pelée – the French translation of Peleus, Thetis’s husband. Mignard thus inventively alludes to Catherine-Thérèse’s recently deceased husband through the smoking volcano in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the most striking elements of the picture is the elaborate shell cup supported by gold mounts which overflows with pearls and coral, offered up by Cupid to the Marquise. Such cups were prized novelties in sixteenth and seventeenth-century Europe. Its inclusion in the painting speaks to France’s position as a global power and to the Marquis de Seignelay’s naval exploits. More shells are scattered at the water’s edge, originating from across the globe, commemorating her husband’s career in the French royal navy and his famed collection of rare objects. Together with the coral, pearls, and cup, the shells are materials of empire used to celebrate the status of the sitter and the riches gained through trade. The same iconography is used in Mignard’s earlier portrait of Louise de Kéroualle, the Duchess of Portsmouth, painted in 1682 (National Portrait Gallery, London).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With one hand on his helmet, the other on his rapier, this unidentified man looks directly at us, willing us to engage with him. He stands in a partially ruined architectural setting, beside a large broken column on which his helmet rests. Slightly ruinous marble settings were common in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni’s</a> portraits. The painting is lit from the right, which suggests that it was made for a specific location, as would be likely with a commission for a full-length portrait of this kind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in other male portraits by Moroni, the man is only partially armed. His chain mail sleeves may be attached to an arming doublet – like that we see in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN6-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Knight with his Jousting Helmet</a></span> – here worn beneath his black tunic. Such sleeves were designed to protect the arm below an arm-piece of plate armour, such as the one on the ground in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Knight with his Jousting Helmet</span>. The man’s sword is a rapier with a complex guard, which due to changes in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> is now difficult to make out against the black of his clothing. The helmet is a field-close helmet, like the one seen in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Knight with his Jousting Helmet</span>, but without the plumes. We think that the two paintings are likely to have been produced at around the same time because of the similar shapes of the tunics and trunks and the cut of the men’s beards. It has often been supposed they were painted to hang together as companion portraits, but there is no convincing reason to think that this was the case.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Moroni has adopted a very limited colour palette of blue, grey and black for this portrait, creating a striking visual effect. He repeats details of colour and pattern to focus our attention on the sitter’s face and hands and to tie the composition together visually. The rusty marks on the wall are echoed in the orange, yellow and red cuffs of the sitter’s chain mail sleeves and in his gingery beard. The grey dotted veins on the column shaft recall the dotted pattern and tone of the chain mail, creating a visual link between the sitter and the column. The contrasting textures of wool and satin of the sitter’s black clothes are no longer apparent due to damage to the paint when the picture was rolled up in the past.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A column is an attribute of Fortitude and can also suggest the endurance of ancient values or a family lineage. The prominence of the column shaft in this portrait may imply that the sitter also has these virtues. The niche directly behind the column is curious and a feature only rarely seen in fifteenth- and early sixteenth-century Italian architecture. At the Palazzo del Comune (formerly Palazzo della Loggia) in Brescia, four huge limestone Corinthian columns are set in precisely similar niches. They were put in place in the late fifteenth century, but the facade was only completed in the 1550s and early 1560s – the date this portrait was probably painted. Moroni, who lived and worked in Brescia and was the son of a mason, may have seen them and admired the unusual and extravagant effect. He repeated the column and niche in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of Antonio Navagero</span> dated 1565 (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an affectionate portrayal of one of Murillo’s most devoted patrons, Don Justino de Neve. The inscribed tablet on the wall reveals that the portrait was made in 1665 and was a gift from the artist – a gesture of friendship.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Murillo’s regard for his friend is obvious in the way he presents him: Justino appears intelligent and welcoming, and while his formal pose indicates his status he is not intimidating. Dressed in a black ecclesiastical cloak, he leans forward as if momentarily interrupted from prayer. The objects on the table relate to his scholarly interests and wealth; a devoted dog sits at his feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A well-respected churchman, Justino became a canon of Seville Cathedral in 1658. He secured an important commission for Murillo: a series of canvases for the church of Santa María la Blanca. This portrait may have been painted to show the artist’s gratitude.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an affectionate portrayal by<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRD-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Murillo</a> of one of his most devoted patrons, Don Justino de Neve. The inscribed tablet on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilaster</a> reveals that the portrait was made in 1665, when Justino was 40 years old, and that it was a gift from the artist – a gesture of friendship.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Justino was born in Seville in 1625, the son of a prosperous Flemish merchant, Juan de Neve, and a Spaniard, Sebastiana de Chaves. A coat of arms in the background combines the arms of the Neve family on the left and those of the Chaves on the right. Justino was ordained as a priest in 1646 and became a canon of Seville Cathedral in 1658. He was a well-respected churchman of considerable wealth, renowned for his charity, piety and devotion to learning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Murillo’s regard for his friend is obvious in the sympathetic way he presents him: his formal pose indicates his status but his intelligent gaze is not intimidating. Dressed in a black ecclesiastical cloak, Justino leans forward slightly as if momentarily interrupted from prayer, his finger marking his place in the small book he holds. He sits in a wooden chair upholstered in crimson velvet, in a room with a view of the terrace and landscape beyond. A delicate silver bell, an ornate clock – the time indicates that Justino is nearing the end of mid-afternoon prayer – and a larger book, alluding to his scholarly interests, rest on the table. A plump ‘toy’ dog with a ribbon and bells on its collar gazes devotedly up at him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are echoes of this work in another Spanish portrait in our collection, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GM5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Queen Mariana of Spain in Mourning</a></span>, which was painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velázquez</a>’s son-in-law, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Juan Bautista del Mazo</a>, in 1666.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Justino was an avid art collector and owned 18 paintings by Murillo, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2K-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Infant Saint John the Baptist with the Lamb</a></span>, now in our collection. He also secured an important commission for Murillo: the decoration of a series of canvases for the church of Santa María la Blanca in Seville. This portrait was painted in the same year as the church’s inauguration, suggesting that it was intended to show Murillo’s gratitude for the support he had received. Justino also oversaw several other commissions, notably Murillo’s series of nine paintings for the chapter house of Seville Cathedral (1668) and other works for the Hospital of the Venerables Sacerdotes (1670s), an institution for poor and retired priests, founded in large part by Justino himself. On Justino’s death in 1685 this portrait was bequeathed to the Hospital, where it remained until the early nineteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Murillo painted far fewer portraits than he did religious subjects, though we are fortunate enough to own the artist’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Self Portrait</a></span> from about 1670.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This full-length portrait is of Thomas Lister, who became the 4th (and last) Lord Ribblesdale in 1876, when he was just 22. He was a Liberal peer, a lord-in-waiting at court and a Trustee of both the National Portrait Gallery and the National Gallery. At the time he painted it, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Singer Sargent</a> was a highly regarded society portraitist. This portrait was not a commission, but was instigated by Sargent himself after he had seen Lord Ribblesdale give a speech in 1894 (although he did not begin work on it for another five years).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A dedicated sportsman, Ribblesdale had been Master of the Queen’s Buckhounds between 1892 and 1895. Plans to paint him in full hunting livery were abandoned. Instead, Ribblesdale wears his own informal ‘ratcatcher’ hunting clothes, their practicality revealing something of his character. Holding a riding whip, he wears a pale yellow waistcoat, dark brown jacket, box-cloth breeches, grey kid gloves and polished black leather butcher boots. His outfit is completed by a large unbuttoned Chesterfield overcoat. His face is framed by a black silk muffler, worn to one side when hunting, and a top hat, which he also wore while hunting. A thin line of red paint at the end of the whip’s coiled cord (the ‘popper’) is the only touch of bright colour in a picture almost entirely composed in muted tones of black, yellow-ochre and greenish grey.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a preliminary oil sketch Lord Ribblesdale is standing on steps, with one leg raised, in front of a large column. In the final portrait he poses against the more neutral panelling of Sargent’s studio at Tite Street, London. With one hand on his hip, his pose is casual yet confident, with just a hint of swagger. His top hat, set at a slight angle, also introduces a note of rakishness. Sargent has deliberately elongated Ribblesdale’s tall, lean body, its vertical line reinforced by the perpendicular of the fluted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilaster</a> behind him. His compact silhouette and the taut outlines of his long coat, particularly below the waist, further enhance his stature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Sargent chose the coat himself. He had previously painted W. Graham Robertson (Tate, London) wearing an identical Chesterfield overcoat (Robertson’s own) with a black velvet collar, and also posing with a hand on his hip. In that portrait, Sargent had included a vertical backdrop (a doorframe) and props (a walking cane) to create the same effect of elongating the figure – a technique used also by his contemporary, James McNeil Whistler. But while Robertson appears as a typical late nineteenth-century aesthete, Lord Ribblesdale, as the epitome of Edwardian patrician authority, represents a very different social type.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait was highly praised when first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1902 and came to define the public perception of Ribblesdale. When it was exhibited in Paris the following year, Lord Ribblesdale revealed how it ‘forced greatness upon me … wherever I go, I am recognised‘. On seeing him some 15 years later, the novelist Virginia Woolf noted that Ribblesdale was ‘the very image of his picture – only obviously seedy and dissolute’. Upon Lord Ribblesdale’s death in 1925, it was the portrait that was reproduced in his obituary, despite having been painted over 20 years earlier.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dressed in a sumptuous black velvet doublet and satin robe trimmed with ermine, the man in this portrait looks out to his right with a steady, impassive gaze. Seated in front of an architectural column against a backdrop of shimmering green drapery, the full-length format of this portrait conveys the importance and status of the sitter. He has traditionally been identified as a member of the Soranzo, one of Venice’s leading noble families, for whom Veronese undertook several commissions throughout his career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sombre style and almost monochrome colour palette date this work to the very last decade of Veronese’s life. During this period, he was working on numerous public and private commissions, particularly for Venice’s Palazzo Ducale. He had little time to dedicate to portraiture, making this a rare, late example of his work in this genre.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This full-length portrait shows a man seated in a Roman-style chair, against a backdrop of deep green drapery and a classical column and pedestal. Dressed in sumptuous black satin trimmed with ermine, his clothing conveys his wealth and social status. It is likely that the sitter himself chose this outfit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are not certain of this man’s identity and it has been suggested that he may be a member of the Soranzo family. One of Venice’s leading noble families, they held numerous prestigious seats of political power, including the election of Giovanni Soranzo (1240–1328) as the 51st <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Doge</a> of Venice. Seventeenth-century sources record a portrait of this description, together with its pendant, as belonging to the Venetian collection of the Dutch merchant Jan Van Reynst (1601–1646) and later in 1663 in the collection of the French painter Nicolas Régnier (about 1591–1667). The Soranzo connection is plausible as there is evidence that Veronese may have moved from Verona to Venice thanks to the influence of Pietro Soranzo (1496–1554), and one of the artist’s earliest commissions was the fresco decoration of the family’s country villa La Soranza, at Treville di Castelfranco, Veneto. It is difficult to say which member of the family commissioned Veronese to paint this portrait, but he maintained close connections with the Soranzo throughout his career. The luxurious materials combined with a sombre use of colour and austere detail convey a sense of self-possessed elegance and reserve, in keeping with contemporary social mores expected of a member of Venice’s ruling class.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As a genre intended to promote the status of an individual and a marker of family lineage, portraiture had a particularly important role among the wealthy elite of sixteenth-century Venice. The art historian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgio Vasari</a> singled out portrait collecting as a notable and long-standing custom in the city, where multiple patrician families competed for political power.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In contrast to his contemporary leading Venetian counterparts <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tintoretto</a>, portraiture formed a much smaller part of Veronese’s artistic output. However, he still wielded influence in this genre, especially for his role in popularising the full-length format among Venice’s elite. This type of portraiture was considerably rare in the first half of the sixteenth century, with one notable exception being <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moretto da Brescia</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>, the earliest surviving example of a life-size, full-length portrait on canvas or panel painted in Italy. Veronese may well have been familiar with these examples of Moretto’s portraiture, given the proximity of Brescia to Verona, his place of birth. This can be seen in the use of a column pedestal against which a sitter is poised, a motif that also features prominently in works such as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FWI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Gentleman</a></span> by Moretto’s pupil, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Battista Moroni</a>. He used this format, seen in mainland Italy, to paint members of Venice’s elite. Veronese’s innovative use of the full-length format and striking black and white costume likely influenced later portraiture such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck’s</a> <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1H-0001-0000-0000.htm">Abbé Scaglia</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The restrained, almost monochrome colour palette and loose brushwork of this painting are characteristic of Veronese’s late style, suggesting this was painted in the final years of the artist’s life. It shares much in common stylistically with other late portraits such as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Gentleman</span> (about 1585, Galleria Colonna, Rome) and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Woman with a Dog</span> (1560–70, Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza, Madrid), which also feature elegantly poised sitters set against a shadowy background, and framed by a swag of deep emerald drapery. The strong diagonals add a dynamism to his otherwise reserved attitude. Veronese painted very few full-length portraits of individuals in his later years, making this a rare example of his work in this genre.</p></div>
