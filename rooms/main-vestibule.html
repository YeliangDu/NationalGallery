This was a nationwide programme of participatory events and performances to celebrate the Gallery’s 200th birthday in 2024. For this project, Deller partnered with the art gallery Mostyn in Llandudno and the Welsh-language theatre Frân Wen’s Young Company. Together, they devised <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Carreg Ateb: Vision or Dream?</span> a multi-part production that travelled from North Wales to London.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It ended with a special performance in Trafalgar Square on 26 July 2025. Young performers presented the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manod Slate Tablet</span> to the Gallery’s Director, Sir Gabriele Finaldi. It bears an inscription in Welsh and English that captures the special connection between the Gallery and Wales:</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Daw’r llechen hon o chwarel Manod yng Ngogledd Cymru lle cafodd paentiadau’r Oriel Genedlaethol eu diogelu yn ystod yr Ail Ryfel Byd</span></p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">This slate is from Manod quarry in North Wales where the National Gallery’s paintings were protected during World War II</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">John Neilson, a letter carver based in North Wales, engraved the tablet. He used slate excavated from the same location in Manod quarry. The tablet’s design features unique lettering devised by Neilson. The commission was supported by CELF, the National Contemporary Art Gallery for Wales.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Gallery had been <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/about-us/history/the-gallery-in-wartime">preparing for war</a> since at least 1938. On 23 August 1939, the first paintings left Trafalgar Square. The final pictures departed on 2 September, just hours before war was declared. Trains took the collection to various sites across Wales before they were reunited in Manod. After the Fall of France in 1940, bombing raids intensified.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The slate mines at Manod were chosen in the summer of 1940 to provide deeper protection. Explosives were used to enlarge the entrance to the mines to accommodate the largest paintings. Inside, several brick-lined rooms were built to protect the paintings from changes in temperature and humidity. The stable conditions during this time informed how we care for the collection today. By the summer of 1941, the Gallery’s paintings were stored together in the caverns. They remained there for a further four years.</p></div>

Marsyas challenged Apollo to a music contest, which the god won. To punish him for his presumption, Apollo then skinned Marsyas alive. Here the satyr is tied to a tree while Apollo, in a red cloak and with his lyre on the grass beside him, leans forward to plunge his knife into Marsyas' skin. They are surrounded by a group of fauns, nymphs and other figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of ten <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> by Domenichino and assistants depicting stories of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E91-0008-0000-0000.htm">Apollo</a> which originally adorned the walls of a room known as the Stanza di Apollo in a garden pavilion in the grounds of the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati, near Rome. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HYU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eight of the frescoes</a> were transferred to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> and are now in our collection. The decoration of the room glorified the Aldobrandini family and expressed their philosophical and religious ideas. For them, Apollo was not just the classical god of the sun, but also the light of reason. By contrast, Marsyas, whose half-animal nature is seen in his hairy legs, represented the sensual and brutish aspects of human nature, and his grisly death symbolised the triumph of reason over man’s darker passions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This, the only fresco in a horizontal format, was originally positioned over the entrance and so would have been seen last, as the viewer turned to leave the room. Its composition, which is centrally arranged, would have been viewed directly from below and the scene summed up the theme of the entire room. The tapestry border is a modern addition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are five preparatory drawings for figures in this scene in the Royal Collection at Windsor Castle, and a sixth for the landscape background. One figure was changed in the final painting: the kneeling satyr was originally standing, suggesting that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a> may have been actively involved in painting this particular fresco. Of the other scenes in the Stanza, Domenichino was responsible for their design but the actual painting was left largely to assistants.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Anna Brownell Jameson (1794–1860) was a pioneering writer and art historian who made significant contributions to art criticism and literature. She is considered England’s first female art historian. Born in Dublin and educated in London, she began her career as a governess before rising to prominence with her literary work. Over her thirty-year career, necessitated through having to support several family members, she published a range of influential books. In <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Memoirs of Celebrated Female Sovereigns</span> (1831) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Characteristics of Women, Moral, Poetical and Historical</span> (1832), she strongly advocated women’s roles in history and literature. Through publications such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sacred and Legendary Art</span> (1848–64), she later established herself as a leading art critic. Other works, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Handbook to the Public Galleries</span> (1842) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Memoirs of the Early Italian Painters</span> (1845), played a crucial role in educating the public about art and supporting the National Gallery’s mission to reach broad audiences. Her works are often informed by her deep knowledge of the art and culture of Italy and Germany.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In honour of Jameson, her friend Susan Horner commissioned a bust in May 1860 and approached a mutual friend John Gibson (1790–1866). The sculptor agreed to create an image for £50, in recognition of his respect for Jameson, and completed it by autumn 1862. In fact, he used a medallion modelled by Susan Horner herself from a cast of Jameson’s face after death. The marble bust, together with a plinth on which was inscribed a laudatory inscription, was initially given to the South Kensington Museum (V&amp;A), but following concerns about its poor display, it was moved to the National Portrait Gallery in 1883.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Anna Brownell Jameson, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">née</span> Murphy (1794–1860) was a writer and art historian who was born in Dublin on 19 May 1794. She was the eldest of five daughters of Denis Brownell Murphy (d.1842), an Irish miniature artist, and his English wife, Johanna (Minnie, d.1854). The family were itinerant, moving first to Whitehaven in Cumberland in 1798 and then Newcastle in 1802, before eventually settling in London near Pall Mall in 1806. To support her impoverished family, from 1810 Jameson was employed as a governess, initially by the Marquess of Winchester, then by the Rowles family of Bradbourne Park, Kent and finally by the Littleton family (the future Lord and Lady Hatherton) of Teddesley, Staffordshire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Considered England’s first female art historian, over a thirty-year literary career, Jameson’s major publications included art criticism, Shakespearean criticism, travel writing, history and biography. As a governess, she travelled to Italy with her young pupil and wrote <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diary of an Ennuyée</span> (1826), an ‘autobiographical’ account featuring insightful descriptions of the art she encountered. She also visited Germany in 1829 and 1833, where she met prominent museum professionals, art historians and artists whose modern perspectives on art interpretation shaped her own views. Throughout her life, Jameson maintained a wide-ranging social network, with close connections to figures like Ottilie von Goethe, Lady Byron and the Brownings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Following her <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Loves of the Poets</span> (1829) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Memoirs of Celebrated Female Sovereigns</span> (1831), it was <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Characteristics of Women, Moral, Poetical and Historical</span> (1832) that established Jameson’s reputation as a writer and advocate for women’s roles in history and literature. Her ill-fated marriage led to her travels around Canada between 1836 and 1838, experiences which she recorded in her travelogue <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Winter Studies and Summer Rambles in Canada</span> (1838). This publication, in which she began to write more openly about the condition of women, confirmed her literary reputation and remained in print at the end of the twentieth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After 1838, art dominated Jameson’s publications. In 1842, she published <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Handbook to the Public Galleries</span>, a survey of and approachable guide to important public art collections in and around London. Its sequel, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Companion to the Most Celebrated Private Galleries of Art in London</span> (1844), underscored her belief in the value of British art collections, while offering a particular defence of the newly instituted wider collecting policies of the National Gallery, which included acquiring early Italian art. Her constant advocacy for this originally unpopular type of art continued through a series of biographies published in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Penny Magazine</span> between 1834 and 1845, later republished as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Memoirs of the Early Italian Painters</span> (1848).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Apart from her influential writings on late medieval and early Renaissance art, Jameson is best known for her writings on iconography. In later years, Jameson focused on producing a six-volume series on Christian art and symbolism, originally titled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sacred and Legendary Art</span>. Following her death, the final volume was completed by her close friend Lady Elizabeth Eastlake (1809–1893), an accomplished author and art critic, who encouraged her husband Sir Charles Eastlake (1793–1865) – the first Director of the National Gallery – to acquire early Italian paintings for the Gallery’s collection. Alongside this series, Jameson continued to review exhibitions and contributed to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The History of the Painters of All Nations</span> (1852).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The idea to commemorate Jameson with a bust originated with her friend, Miss Susan Horner, who organised a fund and wrote to John Gibson (1790–1866) in May 1860, asking him to undertake the commission. Gibson, though rarely agreeing to create busts, accepted both the task and a reduced fee of £50, in recognition of his friendship with Jameson whom, he wrote, ‘had honoured me in print’. The sculptor created the bust using a medallion modelled by Susan Horner herself from a cast of Jameson’s face after death. Horner also wrote to Sir Charles Lyell (1797–1875) to secure permission for the bust’s temporary display at the South Kensington Museum (V&amp;A). On 22 June 1860, Lyell replied that Prince Albert (1819–1861) ‘wishes in this &amp; other cases that there should be inscribed on the pedestal not only the name but some statement of the merits of the individual commemorated which he thinks too much neglected in our public statues’. Miss Horner accordingly devised an inscription and sent a printed copy to Gibson. The final version reads:</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">ANNA JAMESON./1794-1860./A DISTINGUISHED CRITIC,/AND WRITER UPON ART./ENDOWED WITH POETIC GENIUS/AND/A VIGOROUS UNDERSTANDING,/SHE THREW NEW LIGHT/ON THE CHRISTIAN LEGENDS/WHICH INSPIRED/THE PAINTERS AND SCULPTORS OF THE PAST,/AND AWAKENED/A CLEARER COMPREHENSION/OF TRUTH AND BEAUTY/IN ART/AS WELL AS IN NATURE./IN HER LATER YEARS/SHE ROUSED PUBLIC ATTENTION/TO THE SUFFERINGS OF EDUCATED WOMEN,/VAINLY ENDEAVOURING TO EARN/A COMPETENCY,/AND TO THE NECESSITY OF IMPROVING/THEIR CONDITION;/BY REMOVING UNFAIR OBSTACLES,/AND BY RENDERING/LABOUR AS HONOURABLE AS WEALTH./THIS BUST/IS ERECTED BY THOSE/WHO ESTEEM/HER GENIUS AND VIRTUE,/AMONG WHOM IS HER FRIEND/THE SCULPTOR,/WHO EXECUTED THE WORK IN HER HONOUR -/JOHN GIBSON, R.A., OF ROME.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">‘Your inscription cannot be better’, Gibson told Horner in a letter from 10 August 1860. By April 1861, Gibson had modelled the bust, receiving praise from Jameson’s sister Louisa Bate (d.1871), the poet Robert Browning (1812–1889) and others for its likeness and expression. Due to Gibson’s absence from Rome, the marble bust was completed only in autumn 1862.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 9 September, Gibson, who was staying in London with the painter (and future National Gallery Director) William Boxall (1800–1879), helped Susan Horner with arrangements to place the bust in the South Kensington Museum. It remained there until 1883, when Horner, displeased with its neglected location, arranged its transfer to the National Portrait Gallery. She remained involved in its care, expressing concerns about its display as late as 1898. Almost a century later, in 1989, and separated from its plinth, the bust made its way with other Victorian works to Bodelwyddan Castle, North Wales under a regional partnership arrangement. It was reunited with its plinth in 2013, after which the work was returned to London, once the partnership discontinued.</p></div>

Laing returned to Pop Art and painting in the early 2000s, producing a series of anti-war works focussing on the atrocities perpetrated at Abu Ghraib, and paintings of celebrities such as Amy Winehouse, Victoria Beckham and Kate Moss.</p></div>
