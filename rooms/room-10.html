It appears in several paintings in the National Gallery’s collection, from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ugolino di Nerio’s version</a> to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESM-0001-0000-0000.htm">one by Jacopo Bassano</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HFN-0001-0000-0000.htm">a pair of small panels</a> painted by the Milanese artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrogio Bergognone</a>. An inscription in the bottom left corner of this panel includes the date 1501. Bergognone was very fond of lettering done in mordant gilding (where gold leaf is applied over a glue) – it appears in many of his paintings, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FII-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine of Alexandria and Saint Catherine of Siena</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child</a></span>. Here Christ’s halo is inscribed in Latin, ‘Hail Jesus of Nazareth’; the letters on his robes are merely decoration.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although these are biblical events, the setting is not first-century Palestine – it is Renaissance Italy. The path leads between grassy banks dotted with flowers, and in the background is a walled town on the edge of a river or lake. It is clearly a fine day: the skies are blue, people stroll on the path by the water and washing has been hung to dry over the balcony. Like many Renaissance artists, Bergognone often showed sacred stories in contemporary settings that would be familiar to his audience: for Renaissance Christians, the Bible was here and now, not ancient history.</p></div>

At Gethsemane, Christ – knowing that he has been betrayed and will die – takes Peter, James and John away from the other apostles and asks them to watch while he prays. As he asks God to ‘take away this cup from me’, the apostles repeatedly fall asleep and fail to see the soldiers who have come to arrest Christ. His distress is plain: crystal tears fall from his eyes, and beads of sweat form on his brow as he contemplates his imminent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This setting, however, is not first-century Palestine – it’s a beautiful morning in northern Italy in the late fifteenth or early sixteenth century.

These still, calm figures painted in bright colours and lit with a clear light are characteristic of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrogio Bergognone</a>. Although he was a contemporary of radical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">High Renaissance</a> artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a>, who was also in Milan from about 1482, Bergognone’s almond-eyed virgins with their silvery skin tones hark back to Lombard painting of an earlier era, in particular the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vincenzo Foppa</a>, with whom he perhaps trained.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Bergognone seems to have been unaffected by Leonardo’s dramatic compositional and atmospheric effects – the work couldn‘t be more different to ’<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin of the Rocks</a></span>' – this is very much a painting of the High Renaissance. Bergognone was fascinated with the kind of perspectival effects which had arrived in Milan with the painter and architect <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0REW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bramante</a> in the early 1480s. To fool us into seeing a three-dimensional space on a flat panel, he has made it seem as if we are looking up into a Renaissance loggia (an open-sided gallery or room) – you can see its coffered ceiling and the receding curves of its lateral arches with their different coloured stones. The same interests appear in the works of his Milanese contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QIV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Solario</a>, and more widely in Italian painting, for example <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FNR-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Annunciation, with Saint Emidius</a></span> by Carlo Crivelli. Like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a>, Bergognone played spatial games with his viewers: Saint Catherine’s wheel teeters on the edge of the marble step, as if about to tumble off into our world, just like the fruit in Crivelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Annunciation</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was one of ten Bergognone made for the Certosa (Charterhouse) of Pavia in the late 1480s and early 1490s, including probably <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child</a></span>. It presumably hung in the fifth chapel off the left aisle of the nave, which is dedicated to Saints Catherine of Alexandria and Catherine of Siena. There was originally more to the altarpiece than this single panel; it has lost its frame, which would have covered the arch of unpainted wood around the top, and its crowning <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5X-0008-0000-0000.htm">lunette</a>, which showed the dead Christ on the lap of the Virgin. The lunette was bought by the National Gallery at the same time as the main panel but was lost at sea while being shipped to England in 1860.</p></div>

The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> on her knee holds an apple, symbolising the fruit with which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eve tempted Adam</a>  in the Garden of Eden.  A swallow, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">rondine</span> of the painting’s title, is perched above the Virgin’s head. Because they reappeared every spring, swallows symbolised the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saints on either side of her reflect the concerns of the patrons, one a churchman, the other a soldier. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, in his cardinal’s robes, carries the books of the Bible which he translated into Latin; on them, a model church balances precariously. Rays of light come from its open door, suggesting the light which Jerome’s writings cast on holy scripture. Opposite him is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a>, dressed as a medieval knight, an arrow pinched delicately between his fingers. Sebastian was a Roman solider and a secret Christian. When his faith was discovered he was shot with arrows, but did not die.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jerome looks intently at Christ and points at his model church, asking for Christ’s mercy on the Church. In response, Jesus points to his mother – a symbol of the Christian Church. Sebastian, in contrast, looks out at us: he personifies the Ottoni family’s ideal of the perfect Christian knight. In the Middle Ages Sebastian’s arrow wounds were related to the black swellings of bubonic plague, which ravaged Western Europe from the mid-fourteenth century. Here, his down-turned arrow symbolises his role as protector from the disease, which had hit Matelica in the 1480s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With clothing, then as now, indicating social position, the Virgin is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century Italian fashion. Her sleeves are made of brocaded cloth of gold, laced at wrist and elbow, slashed to reveal her linen shift. People who lived in Matelica would have been especially interested in luxury fabrics, as the town was a centre of textile manufacture and the Ottonis themselves owned wool, silk and dye workshops.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli himself was fascinated by decorative textiles – they appear in many of his paintings, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FNF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saints Francis and Sebastian</a></span> – and the Virgin, her throne and even the back wall are draped in rich silk. He was an economical artist, though: look closely and you can see that he has used the same design for both the silks draped over the back wall, and that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a> is repeated in Saint Sebastian’s sleeve. Like earlier Italian artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Angelico</a>, Crivelli clearly had a stock of designs, probably drawings, which he recycled and reworked, creating an impression of variety by giving them different textures and colouring and changing their scale. Here, the two silks hanging on either side of the throne show different portions of the same design and are in different colours, making the repetition less obvious.</p></div>

Its scenes reflect the patrons' interests: one was a churchman, the other a soldier.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On our left is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a>, one hand resting on her main attribute, a spiked wheel. To show off his skill at foreshortening, Crivelli has rotated this so that we see it side on, its spokes retreating at a sharp angle. According to her legend, Catherine was a Christian princess whose arguments defeated those of the Roman philosophers brought to debate with her. When she then refused to marry the Roman emperor, he had her tortured on a wheel. She stands for theological learning and the defence of the Church by intellectual argument. But this is no unwordly academic: from her hair, crown and pearl circlet – pearls were symbols of chastity –  to her golden brocade over-dress, its sleeves slashed to show her linen shirt, she is dressed in the height of late fifteenth-century Italian fashion. A translucent veil floats behind her, and elongated features and fingers emphasise her elegance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the opposite end, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint George</a> raises his sword to slay an incongruously small dragon. His stallion rears in alarm, twisting its head up and away from the dragon. In the background the princess kneels on a rocky outcrop, while her father and his subjects watch from the safety of a walled city. This saintly warrior exemplifies the knightly ethic of the Ottoni family (Ranuzio Ottoni was to die fighting against the French in 1510).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central scenes tell the stories of the figures represented in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">main panel of the altarpiece</a>. In the middle is the Nativity. Finding no room at Bethlehem, the holy family have set up camp in the best place available. On the shelves behind them we see pots and pans, a book, a straw-bound carafe and a flask of wine. Through the arch to right shepherds gaze up in amazement at the choir of angels, while their dog sleeps oblivious. To the left other travellers make their way through tidy gardens to the gates of Bethlehem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the left, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, his cardinal’s hat hung on a convenient tree, kneels before a crucifix, grasping a stone with which to beat his chest. Before translating the Bible, Jerome was thought to have spent time in the desert repenting his sins. His lion lies like a large dog beside him and around him are desert animals: a snake, a vulture and a dragon, perhaps symbolising temptation overcome and linking him with Saint George. In his roughly built hut is a shelf of domestic odds and ends, a desk loaded with books – the saint took his library with him – and a pen case hanging from the wall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the right, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a> is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyred</a>. The saint, clearly the same young man shown in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece’s main panel</a> –- notice his upturned fringe and flying golden locks – has been stripped of his finery and strung up in the bare branches of a tree. Through the arch behind him we see figures strolling in a courtyard, either unmoved or unaware of the martyrdom taking place so close by.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With the exception of Saint Catherine, the soft tones and barren landscapes of the predella scenes contrast vividly with the glowing splendour of the main panel.</p></div>

He is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJ3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Andrew</a>, the first <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> and a particular favourite of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a> as a preacher and a  converter of non-Christians.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli has shown him as in his usual guise as an old man, clasping a cross and a Gospel book. His flowing grey locks tumble over his shoulders, and his face is deep in shadow as he gazes down at the book clasped in his right hand, his thumb thrust in to hold it open at the right place. In a masterly display of foreshortening, Crivelli has painted the cross and the fluttering pages of the book at a dramatically acute angle – compare this to the flat books held by the saints in Masolino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Pope (Saint Gregory?) and Saint Matthias</a></span>. The love of realistic detail – the nails in the cross, the wrinkled edges of the parchment pages, the crow’s feet of wrinkles around the saint’s eyes – is typical of Crivelli, as are crisp lines of the saint’s curling beard and his crumpled robes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Andrew’s cross here is the simple form which was usual in the Marche, rather than the X-shaped cross more often seen in scenes of his crucifixion. In his old age Andrew was thought to have settled in the Peloponnese in Greece, where he converted the wife of the Roman governor of Patras to Christianity. In fury the governor ordered him to be crucified in imitation of Christ, though he was to be tied rather than nailed to a cross in order to prolong his agony. Andrew welcomed his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>. After he had hung for two days on the cross, crowds began to threaten the governor for torturing an old man but Andrew demanded to left on his cross to die.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Andrew was especially popular in the Italian Marche in the late fifteenth century. In 1460 the relic of his head was brought to Italy from Patras after the city fell to the Turks and given to the Pope by the brother of the last <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> emperor. It landed at Ancona, where it was carefully verified by the Pope’s representative. Then, surrounded by candles, it was sent on a stately procession through the Marche and Umbria, before being placed in a shrine in Saint Peters in Rome.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This golden-haired princess is Saint Catherine of Alexandria, identifiable by her attributes of a spiked wheel and martyr’s palm. She comes from the great <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HNT-0001-0000-0000.htm">polyptych (multi-panelled altarpiece) which Crivelli painted</a> for the church of San Domenico in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The graceful use of line and a fascination with decorative detail are typical of Crivelli, as is his interest in spatial games. Although the background is gold – indicating that she is heaven – Catherine stands on a marble shelf which seems to recede sharply. In a kind of Renaissance virtual reality, the toe of her shoe peeps out over the edge of the marble parapet and casts a shadow on it, as if she is about to step out of the panel into our space. To show off his skill with foreshortening, Crivelli depicts her wheel sideways on, at a dramatically acute angle. This was a relatively novel way of showing objects in the late fifteenth century – compare it to the flat wheel held by Saint Catherine in Giovanni da Milano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ and the Virgin Enthroned with Six Saints</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Catherine was a scholarly Christian princess who lived in third-century Alexandria under Roman rule. When she asked the Roman Emperor to stop persecuting Christians, he sent his best philosophers to debate with her and to persuade her to revert to paganism. They failed and many converted to Christianity on the strength of Catherine’s arguments. The Emperor then asked her to marry him. When she refused, he had her tortured on a wheel and finally beheaded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She  was beloved by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a>, who commissioned this altarpiece, as a martyr who defended the Christian faith  against pagans and heretics through intellectual argument. The Dominicans were one of the two great mendicant or preaching orders founded in the Middle Ages to provide educated preachers in towns and cities (the others being the Franciscans). One of their main concerns was to combat heresy, both through scholarly debate and through the Inquisition, which they organised.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although she lived in the third century, Catherine is here dressed in fifteenth-century fashion. She wears an overdress of red and gold figured silk, such as was produced in medieval Italy. This is laced under her arms and has a broad gold collar and elaborate clasps of gilded <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span>. The fastenings down the front have been left open to reveal her linen shift, and her sleeves slashed to allow it to escape in elegant puffs – sleeves at this time were detachable, and so tight that it was impossible to move unless openings were left. The shift itself is so fine as to be almost translucent, and is edged with a ribbon at the neck and wrists. Her sleeves are decorated with golden pelicans and phoenixes, symbols of Christ’s sacrifice on the Cross and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>. This fabric is a deliberately old-fashioned design; it is very similar to that worn by one of the kings in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6K-0001-0000-0000.htm"> The Wilton Diptych</a></span>, made around 80 years earlier. This would have been immediately clear to fifteenth-century Ascolians as the Marche was a centre of the textile industry. Crivelli is making the point that although she is dressed in contemporary clothes, Catherine lived in the ancient past.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her forehead has been shaved to give it greater height, as was the fashion at the time, and her long blonde hair wound in fantastic curls around her coronet. The coronet and the neckline of her dress are decorated with small balls, one of which is missing. These would have been silvered to imitate pearls. Her dress and hairstyle are very similar to that of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FL6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Lucy</a></span>, whom Crivelli painted for a smaller polyptych for the same church.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This graceful golden-haired princess comes from a predella, a row of scenes along the bottom of an altarpiece or from the frame of an altarpiece. She is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Catherine</a>, shown with her traditional attributes of a spiked wheel and a cactus-like martyr’s palm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a> liked spatial games, playing with our knowledge that we are looking at a flat painted surface on which he has created an illusion of three-dimensional space. Here Catherine stands in a curved marble recess, rather like a statue. We can see her shadow on the wall behind her. To show off his skill with foreshortening Crivelli has shown her wheel sideways on, with its spokes receding at a sharp angle. Her skirts fall in heavy folds around her feet, and the toe of her shoe peeps out over the edge of marble parapet, as if she is breaking out of the flat panel into our space. To her left a fly seems to walk across the picture, casting its own shadow on the flat surface and reminding us that this is just a painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to legend, Catherine was a scholarly Christian princess who lived in Alexandria under Roman rule. When she asked the Roman Emperor to stop persecuting Christians, he sent his best philosophers to debate with her and to try to persuade her to revert to paganism. They failed and many converted to Christianity on the strength of Catherine’s arguments. The Emperor then asked her to marry him. When she refused, he had her tortured on a wheel and finally beheaded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another panel from the same altarpiece is also in our collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5Y-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a></span>.</p></div>

This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EBT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Dominic</a> himself, holding a white lily to symbolise his chastity and the book of his Rule – the code of practice for the religious order he founded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominicans</a>, often known as the ‘Blackfriars’ in England, were one of the two great mendicant or preaching orders founded in the Middle Ages to provide educated preachers in towns and cities (the other being the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscans</a>). Mendicant comes from <span class="dokuwiki_italic">mendicare</span>, or ‘to beg’ in Latin. Men who joined the mendicant orders took vows of poverty and travelled from place to place, preaching and living on what was given by their listeners. One of their main concerns was to combat heresy, both through scholarly debate and through the Inquisition, which they organised.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint presses his hand to his chest, his eyes humbly lowered to gaze at the sleeping Christ Child in the centre panel (now <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUV-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child</a></span>). The severity of his black and white robes – the uniform of the Dominican Order – contrasts with the damask tooling of the burnished gold background, and with the opulence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FO1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a>’s papal regalia further to the left of the altarpiece. Showing off his skill at foreshortening, Crivelli has rotated the saint’s beautifully bound book: we see the fore-edges with their gilded clasp straight on and the pink leather covered boards only at an acute angle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli exploits the optical effects of the different gold surfaces, which must have shone and flickered in the candlelight of a medieval church, with the highly burnished gold of his halo acting as a spotlight on the saint’s face. In a detail typical of Crivelli, Dominic’s foot pokes out over the edge of the marble parapet on which he stands, and curls up slightly at the toe. The level of detail in the lilies with their golden stamens, in the sinews in the saint’s hands and feet, is characteristic of Crivelli. His skill as a painter of drapery is such that even though Dominic’s robes are black, we can see folds and creases around the neck and shoulders, and creases in the tops of his shoes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His face is a rare demonstration of Crivelli’s abilities as a portraitist. This is a highly individual face, with its long nose, deep-set eyes ringed with creases and wrinkles, and the line of an old scar running down his cheek. We know from other paintings that the figure is here in a double role: it is Saint Dominic, the founder of the Dominican Order, and a portrait of the Blessed Constanzo di Meo di Servolo (d. 1481), the leading Dominican in the Marche, the prior of San Domenico, and the commissioner of this altarpiece.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This half-length figure of a praying saint comes from the upper tier of a paintings:group82|large [[glossary:polyptychs|polyptych (multi-panelled altarpiece) which Crivelli painted in 1476]] for the high altar of the church of San Domenico, in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. This is Saint Francis, founder of the Franciscan Order. Eyes uplifted and lips parted in passionate prayer, he gazes up in agonised adoration: he would originally have been looking at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Lamentation over the Dead Christ</a> once in the centre of the upper tier. The marks of the stigmata – the wounds of the Crucifixion which miraculously appeared on Francis’s body – are visible on his hands and through the tear in the side of his habit. Crivelli has combined an emotional expression of fervent devotion with a degree of realism unusual in Italian fifteenth-century painting: the sinews stand out on Francis’s hands, veins pulsate in his throat and forehead and we can make out every hair in his eyebrows.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominicans</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscans</a> were friars who took religious vows but were not confined to a monastery – they lived in towns and cities.  Founded in the thirteenth century to provide educated preachers and teachers for a growing urban population, both flourished in the Italian Marche. Men who joined these orders took vows of poverty and travelled from place to place, preaching and living on what was given by their listeners – although this did not prevent the Orders commissioning costly works of art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli has shown Francis here in the ash-grey habit of the especially strict Observant (reformed) Franciscans. The three knots on the belt symbolise the vows of poverty, chastity and obedience all Franciscans took. Saint Francis’s prominence on a Dominican altarpiece perhaps reflects a special sympathy for them on the part of the Observant Dominicans of Ascoli. The austere grey of his habit with its crisp, deep folds forms a striking contrast to the glittering damask patterns tooled into the gilded background. Crivelli was skilled at exploiting the optical effects of the different gold surfaces, which would have flickered and shone in the candlelight of a medieval church, making the smooth gold and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> decoration of Francis’s halo act as a spotlight on his head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli painted  many works for Franciscans of the Marche, including the painting which once hung over the tomb of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Blessed Gabriele Ferretti</a>, and is now in our collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This striking half-naked figure is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>. He comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HNT-0001-0000-0000.htm">polyptych which Crivelli painted in 1476</a> for the high altar of the church of San Domenico, in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. The saint’s stance, one leg bent and hip curved out to the side, gives him a sense of solidity. We can see the sinews and veins of John’s hands and feet, his long bony toes and ankles, and the individual hairs of his hair and on the inside of the skin laced around him; this level of naturalistic detail is more characteristic of Netherlandish painters, like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, than of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli‘</a>s fellow Italian artists. The smooth gold of his body and the roughness of the animal skin he wears contrast with the deep, crisp folds of the lavish pink and green fabric wrapped around him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike the other saints made for the main section of this altarpiece, John stands not on a marble parapet but in a wilderness of pink rocks scattered with bare trees. A clear stream flows along the front of the painting, and reeds sprout up along the water’s edge. Through the translucent water we can see pebbles scattered on the river bed. The barren landscape and the saint’s apron allude to the years John spent as a hermit in the desert, punishing his body with uncomfortable clothes and poor food to bring him closer to God. John is said to have worn a camel skin – hair side towards  his flesh so that it  was scratchy and uncomfortable – and to have foraged for food, eating wild honey and locusts.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The stream is the River Jordan where John baptised the people of Judea and Jerusalem, Jesus among them. Parts of the near bank are visible at the bottom of the painting, making us feel that we are only separated from John by the river. A small bird, its back turned to us, perches on a branch to John’s right. It is perhaps a goldfinch, a symbol of Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">passion</a>. An almost identical bird appears in another painting by Crivelli, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLX-0001-0000-0000.htm"> The Vision of the Blessed Gabriele Ferretti</a>. Perhaps Crivelli kept a model book with drawings of birds and animals, such as we know other fifteenth-century artists used.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a detail typical of Crivelli, the saint gazes downwards, so that we see only the top of his head and his foreshortened features. He points at the scroll which curls from his right hand, on which is written: Ecce Agnus Dei, Ecce Qui. Theses are the first words of the phrase with which John recognised Christ as the Messiah when he baptised him: ’Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sins of the world.'</p></div>

At once sinuous and solid, she is the counterpart of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Michael</a> who would have stood at the other end of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>. Lucy’s aristocratic pallor, golden locks and fine outfit all echo his, down to the green, pink and gold of her cloak which falls in weighty folds around her feet. Even the decoration of the parapet below her, where boughs of pears grow out the ears of a curly-headed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putto</a>, recalls the ears and head of Satan in the Michael panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a detail typical of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a>, her elongated, bony toes in their pointed red sandals poke out over the edge of the marble parapet on which she stands, linking her heavenly space with ours. Her upturned gaze would originally have rested on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentation over the Dead Christ</span> in the centre of the altarpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lucy holds her cactus-like martyr’s palm in one hand and a circular wooden plate it other. On this rests a pair of hooded, oval eyes, looking disconcertingly like chocolates; they cast oval shadows on the golden wood. According to her legend, Lucy was a Christian convert in third-century Rome, whose mother tried to force her into marriage with a pagan. She refused, having decided to dedicate her life to Christ, and so her frustrated bridegroom denounced her to the  authorities. The Roman governor sentenced Lucy to forced prostitution as punishment, but when the guards came to carry out her sentence, the Holy Ghost made her body so heavy it was impossible to lift. She was then put to death after having her eyes removed. She is now the patron saint of opticians.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although she lived in the third century, Lucy is dressed as a fashionable fifteenth-century lady. She wears a gold jacket embroidered with flowers and foliage, with a broad gold collar and elaborate clasps of raised and gilded <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span>. The fastenings down the front have been left open to reveal her linen shift. She wears a necklace of pearls, symbols of chastity, from which hangs a ruby pendant. Her hair is pulled back from her high forehead – as was the fashion at the time – and wound in elaborate curls around a circlet of pearls. On her head is a veil so transparent as to be almost invisible. Her smart red sandals are an antiquarian detail: Crivelli has included them as a nod to the kind of sandals worn in ancient Rome.</p></div>

She has a circlet of pearls around her head, and her elongated features and fingers emphasise her elegance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although a biblical figure, she is dressed in the height of fifteenth-century fashion, her sleeves slashed to reveal her fine linen shift and her blue overdress unbuttoned at the front to show off her red dress. A red cloak interlined with green and trimmed with gold falls in heavy folds at her feet. Mary Magdalene was often depicted in medieval art wearing red, and with loose, uncovered hair. By the Middle Ages Mary had become a conflation of three separate women: the unnamed woman described as a sinner in the Bible who anointed Christ’s feet with her hair;  Mary, sister of Lazarus and Martha, who anointed his feet with expensive ointment; and Mary of Egypt, who had sex outside marriage – seen as immoral in the Middle Ages – but later renounced her actions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a kind of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> virtual reality, Crivelli plays with our knowledge that we are looking at a flat painted surface by creating the illusion of three-dimensional space. Mary stands on a shelf in front of a curved stone recess, rather like a statue, casting a shadow on the wall behind her. The stone itself is cracked and we can see where pieces have fallen off at the edges. Two stone spheres project forwards above her head, and her knobbly toes in their red sandals protrude over the edge of the shelf, as if she is about to step forwards into our world.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel of the Archangel Michael fighting the Devil was once part of an altarpiece painted by Crivelli for the church of San Domenico in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. Michael is shown as a youthful prince, his sword raised with nonchalant ease to strike the writhing devil beneath his feet.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was once part of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">an altarpiece</a> painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a> for a side chapel in the church of San Domenico in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Michael</a>, the only saint who is also an angel, is shown as a youthful prince, his sword raised with nonchalant ease to strike at the Devil who writhes beneath his feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He pinches a ring delicately in his left hand; from it hang the scales in which he weighs the naked souls at <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETD-0008-0000-0000.htm">the last judgement</a>. At once refined and ferocious, Michael’s pale aristocratic beauty and glittering armour make a vivid contrast to the scaly skin, furred legs and vicious talons of the demon below him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The account of the war in heaven between Michael and his angels and the devil – in the form of a dragon – comes in Revelation 12:7–12. In medieval Italian art, Michael is usually <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKA-0001-0000-0000.htm">shown fighting a dragon</a>. In Northern European art, however, Michael often tramples a wriggling, recumbent demon; Crivelli might have come across such an image through the relatively new medium of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIC-0008-0000-0000.htm">engraved</a> prints.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Michael’s feet rest firmly on the shoulders of his fallen enemy, who claws at his legs and struggles to reach the scales to drag the souls down to hell – he has even put a weight on one side to help tip the balance in his favour. Demon and angel gaze at each other, engrossed in eternal combat. Showing off his talent for foreshortening, Crivelli shows us the top of Michael’s golden head, with its silver coronet and green feather, his face almost hidden as he gazes down. Satan’s head – with its furred ears, fangs and curling pink tongue – is also seen from above, and casts a shadow over the edge of the marble pavement. His bat wings are a ghastly echo of Michael’s glorious feathers – a reminder that Satan too was once an angel. Much of the composition’s energy comes from the constraints placed upon the combatants by the frame: they seem to have been crammed into a space too small to contain them. Comparison with a roughly contemporary depiction of the same subject, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D7N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Michael triumphant over the Devil with the Donor Antonio Juan</a>, shows how Crivelli has compressed the figures into the available space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As prince of the archangels and commander of the heavenly host, Michael was a favourite saint of medieval aristocrats, whose main role was to lead troops in battle. Here he is resplendent in a mix of Roman and contemporary armour. Over a chain mail tunic he wears a tunic of pink and green feathers: this is the armour of an angel, not a man. His gold breastplate has gilded feathers and pearls modelled in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> along its lower edge. The front is patterned with scrolling oak leaves and decorated with a classical <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pastiglia</span> cherub’s head, clusters of pearls – a symbol of angelic purity – and swags of laurel. A pink cloak lined with green and trimmed with gold flutters from his shoulders, echoing the colours of his wings, folded behind him out of the way of his sword. At his knees are lion-masks <span class="dokuwiki_italic">poleyns</span> (knee protectors) one side cast in deep shadow, the other gazing directly out at us. His toes are bare, protruding from classical <span class="dokuwiki_italic">puttees</span> (strips of cloth) which wrap around his lower legs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Michael had a special meaning for the people of eastern Italy. The oldest shrine in Western Europe dedicated to Saint Michael was at Gargano, in Apulia. Monte Sant'Angelo was a major centre of pilgrimage throughout the Middle Ages, and still very popular in the fifteenth-century Marche. It was also a favourite point of departure for both pilgrims to Jerusalem and crusaders, who could pray to the great warrior angel before setting out for the East.</p></div>

He is dressed in the full papal regalia, down to his white jewelled gloves and the red shoes with their gold cross. In a detail typical of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a>, his right shoe pokes out over the edge of the marble parapet – as if asking us to kiss his foot, as those admitted to audience with a pope would have done – and casts a shadow on the marble below it. His cope is pink cloth of gold, interlined with green damask, echoing the robe worn by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a> herself. It hangs in shimmering folds and is edged with an orphrey (ornamental stripe) embroidered with figures of the apostles. This kind of embroidery, known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">opus anglicanum</span> or English work, was one of the most luxurious textiles, and a particular speciality of English craftsmen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli used many different materials and techniques to give his paintings their remarkable three-dimensionality and lustre. Some motifs are modelled in gilded <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> to make them stand out from the flat surface of the painted panel: the papal tiara, the great gold clasp on his cloak, his rings and the dramatically foreshortened Crucifix at the head of his staff. The twisted cord along the edge of the orphrey is real cord, gilded and stuck to the panel. The papal tiara, parts of which were originally silver but have now tarnished, is encrusted cut-and-polished glass. These are modern replacements, possibly for original cabochon jewels – those that had been polished but not cut – such as Crivelli used elsewhere.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The heavy keys, which were Peter’s main attribute, hang from his hand by a gilded cord. They were carved out of wood and then nailed to the panel and gilded. These are the keys to the kingdom of heaven, which Christ gave Peter as a  symbol of his spiritual power. In the same hand he grasps a fantastically bound book, representing the Gospels. Crivelli, showing off his skill at depicting objects at extreme angles, has rotated it so we see the gilded edges (compare, for example, the rather flatter books held by the saints in Masolino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Pope (Saint Gregory?) and Saint Matthias</a></span>. The other hand holds the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">ferula</span> or papal staff, the symbol of the pope’s worldly power.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The force of the saint’s personality, as expressed here by Crivelli, together with the emphasis on the trapping of papacy, serve to underline the absolute authority, both worldly and spiritual, of the popes. This doctrine, called papal supremacy, was a continuous concern to the Church throughout the fifteenth century, when it was questioned by heretical movements, dissident clerics and dissatisfied princes both in Italy and further afield. These were not abstract questions but had led to turmoil and civil unrest in the Marche, and much official art was concerned with asserting the popes' status as Peter’s rightful successors. As organisers of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Inquisition</a>, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a> – whose church this altarpiece was made for – were particularly concerned with rooting out heresy and preaching the sole power of the Church with the pope as its head.</p></div>

Stephen’s smooth and youthful features contrast strongly with the powerful face of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Thomas</a> now next to him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to his legend, Stephen was a Greek Jew who converted early to Christianity. He was such an effective preacher that the Roman authorities became concerned, and put him on trial for blasphemy. At his trial he accused the Jews of murdering <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, and was dragged into the streets of Jerusalem and stoned to death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Stephen was a deacon of the early Church, and so was always shown dressed as a deacon, albeit a fifteenth-century Italian one. He wears a dalmatic (an ankle length, sleeved, outer garment made from silk) with wide strips of embroidery around the cuffs and two large square panels – orphreys – back and front just below the neck. The luscious pink sleeves are lined with green, picking up on the colours of the Virgin’s robe in the centre panel. On either side of the orphrey are two large tassels made of raised <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominicans</a> who commissioned the altarpiece, Stephen was an example of preaching and teaching the faith: alone of the saints in the upper tier, he gazes outwards, summoning the friars in the choir stalls to follow his example. Stephen had a special significance in the Italian Marche, as one of the rocks with which he was stoned was venerated as a relic in the cathedral of Ancona.</p></div>

His strong features and the vigorous set of his jaw express his intellectual authority, as does the book he clasps in his left hand, his fingers holding open its fluttering pages.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli has painted the book half open, with fore-edge towards so us that we see the crinkled edges of the parchment pages; he has made it look like a three-dimensional object, although we know it is not. Crivelli’s skill as a painter of drapery is such that even though Thomas’s robes are black, we can see the deep folds of the hood around his shoulders. The severity of his black and white robes – the uniform of the Dominican Order – contrasts with the opulent gilding of the background.</p></div>

He is the great <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican</a> theologian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Thomas Aquinas</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Compositionally and theologically he balances <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis</a> at the opposite end of the altarpiece. Both look up at the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentation over the Dead Christ</span>, which was originally in the centre of the upper tier (now in New York). In contrast to Francis’s agonised adoration, Thomas gazes unflinchingly upwards, his clear grey eyes wide open, jaw set and mouth turned down in determined lines.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With a realism reminiscent of the work of  Netherlandish artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a> has picked out every hair in his eyebrows and short, tonsured hair, and the veins pulse in his forehead. His strong features and the vigorous set of his jaw express his intellectual authority, as does the book he clasps in his left hand, his fingers holding open its fluttering pages. To show off his skill at foreshortening, Crivelli has painted the book half open, so that we see the crinkled edges of the parchment pages; a very similar detail was used at around the same time by Francesco del Cossa in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F9E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Vincent Ferrer</a></span>. Crivelli’s skill as a painter of drapery is such that even though Thomas’s robes are black, we can see the deep folds of the hood around his shoulders. The severity of his black and white robes – the uniform of the Dominican Order – contrasts with the opulent gilding of the background, and the combination of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> with flat burnished gold in his halo must have acted as a spotlight on the saint’s face in the candlelight of a medieval church. The burnished gold sun on his chest is a symbol of sacred learning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Aquinas spent his life teaching and studying, producing one of the most important texts of the Catholic Church, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Summa Theologica</span>, in which he reconciled the doctrines of Catholic Christianity with the philosophy of Aristotle. For the Dominican friars, Aquinas also represented their essential mission of teaching and preaching to protect the Church from heresy and dangerous doctrines. Unusually, Crivelli has shown him holding a model church, painted in extraordinary detail. It is an Italian fourteenth-century design, of the type that the Ascoli Dominicans must have seen every day, but is badly in need of repair: its masonry is chipped and plants grow out of the brickwork. The brick spire has clearly been repaired, however, and there are even tiny figures visible in the doorway. Is it a symbol of the decay into which the Church had fallen, and which Thomas’s writings and the Dominican friars sought to renew?</p></div>

She comes from a polyptych (a multi-panelled altarpiece) which Crivelli painted in 1476 for the high altar of the church of San Domenico, in Ascoli Piceno in the Italian Marche. A pink watered silk – a cloth of honour of the kind hung behind medieval rulers – hangs in soft folds behind her and creases across the edge of the marble shelf behind her head. In her long, tapering fingers she holds up a translucent cloth on which the Child is seated, as if revealing him to the friars seated in the church. The child himself has slumped forward on his mother’s knee in sleep, his chin resting on her hand, his tiny fingers grasping one of hers. San Domenico was only a small church, and Crivelli’s polyptych must have lit up the nave with a glittering, golden glow.</p></div>

Her blonde hair is covered with a white veil, and with her sad expression seems already aware of her son’s destiny to die on the Cross. In her long, tapering fingers she holds up a translucent cloth on which the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> is seated, as if revealing him to the friars – who, unlike ordinary worshippers, would have be seated near enough to see the panel’s detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Marche was a famous centre of textile production, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a>’s masterly depiction of different fabrics in this painting must have appealed to the Ascoli friars  in spite – or perhaps because – of the austerity of their own black and white garb. Luxurious outfits were clearly allowed in heaven: the Virgin wears an overdress of deep blue damask silk – blue being the colour of heaven – on top of which a pink cloth of gold cloak interlined with green damask, and trimmed with pearls, falls in heavy folds over her knees and feet. Her sleeves are slashed to reveal the fine linen of her underdress and there are pearls around the wrists. The gilded <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1U-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastiglia</a></span> of her crown and gold collar, and the damask <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOX-0008-0000-0000.htm">tooling</a> of the gilded <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> behind her, must have sparkled in the candlelight of a medieval church, while the flat and burnished gold of her halo would have acted as a spotlight on her face.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both her crown and the neck of her overdress are decorated with small balls intended to resemble pearls. These were once silver but are now tarnished. Pieces of red, blue and green coloured glass cut to resemble gem stones are also attached Mary’s crown. These are modern, probably replacements for original cabochon (precious stones that had been polished but not cut).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Child has slumped forward on his mother’s knee in sleep, his chin resting on her hand, his tiny fingers grasping one of hers. Crivelli has turned up his left foot so we can see the sole and the bottom of his toes. His burnished gold halo has been tooled with a cross and an aureole – a circle of radiating lines – of rays, and decorated with imitation pearls.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli liked spatial games, playing with our knowledge that we are looking at a flat surface on which he has created an illusion of three-dimensional space. The Virgin’s red shoe with its curled-up toe peeps out from under the heavy folds of her robe, both casting shadows on the marble floor, which seems to recede dramatically. The fruit – another ‘trademark’ of Crivelli – casts shadows on the marble of the throne, the red cords of the cloth of honour seem to be attached to the frame itself, and the Virgin’s robe tumbles over the edge of the parapet, next to Crivelli’s signature and the date. These appear to have been carved into the stone. The cherubs' heads in the stone frieze along the base are seen as if from directly above and seem to project towards us, casting shadows of their own.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A stout little figure in widow’s dress peers out from behind a saint’s leg. This is Oradea Becchetti, and she is being presented to the Virgin and Child by Saint Francis. The painting was the central panel of an altarpiece made for a family chapel in the Franciscan church at Fabriano, in the Italian Marches.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Oradea founded the chapel in accordance with the will of her husband Giovanni and was clearly proud of what she had achieved: the inscription along the base states that she paid for the altar and painting ‘at no small expense of her own money’. Both words and image suggest a formidable character. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Crivelli</a> has conveyed both her piety – she holds a string of prayer beads – and the determined set of her mouth and jaw.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Oradea and her husband were members of the Fabriano nobility and both from devout families. Her name means ‘pray to god’, while Giovanni’s relatives were prominent clerics and friars. The saints, chosen by Oradea and her spiritual advisers, reflect her and their interests. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">St Francis of Assisi</a>was the founder of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a> and patron of the church. He points to a tear in the side of his habit, showing the stigmata – wounds mimicking those of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, also visible on his hands and feet. Opposite him, the muscular and almost naked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Sebastian</a> – his pubic hair startlingly visible – seems oblivious to the arrows which pierce him. As a soldier Sebastian was popular with medieval aristocrats, but he was also seen as a ‘plague saint’, able to protect people from the disease. The Becchettis must have been worried about plague, successive waves of which ravaged the Marches in the late fifteenth century. Their chapel was dedicated the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> in her guise as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Santa Maria della Consolatione</span>, the Virgin of Consolation, who was particularly associated with protection from the plague.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary is shown as both a loving mother and Queen of Heaven. She sits on a marble throne, with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a> behind her and vases of flowers beside her – lilies and roses, standing for her purity and gentleness. Flowers are scattered at her feet and luscious fruits – Crivelli’s trademark – hang from the throne. The snail by Francis’s foot may even have been understood as a symbol of Christ’s birth to Mary, as snails were thought to reproduce asexually. But this out-of-place mollusc might just have been a trick of Crivelli’s – he loved playing games with viewers, suggesting that his paintings were both flat and three-dimensional. Here it’s not quite clear if the snail is meant to be in the painting or crawling over the surface of it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as gaining credit for Oradea and her family in heaven, the altarpiece aimed to raise money for the friars who ran the church. Indulgences – a way to reduce time spent in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUD-0008-0000-0000.htm">purgatory</a> – were offered to people who gave donations on feasts of the Virgin and Saints Francis and Sebastian.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Crivelli signed the painting on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPS-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartellino</a></span> along the bottom of the throne: CAROLI CRIVELLI VENETI MILES 1491.

The portrayal of his body is also remarkable, capturing the contortion and weight distribution required for a man of his size to descend such a tall and narrow ladder. Signorelli was noted in his time for his expert depiction of the human body and his ability to paint it convincingly in a variety of complex poses without losing a sense of its solidity and weight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> was part of an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> showing the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentation of Christ at the Foot of the Cross</span> made for the high altar of the church of Sant'Agostino in Matelica, a town in the Italian region of the Marche.

Like many altarpieces from Italian churches, it was probably cut up to create a number of separate paintings for sale in the late eighteenth century or early nineteenth century.  We know of other fragments which are now in collections across the world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Giovannantonio di Luca di Paolo, the picture’s patron, had obviously been impressed by a picture of the same subject that Signorelli made for Santa Margherita, a church in his home town of Cortona (Museo Diocesano, Cortona), as he asked him to produce a similar image. Piecing together the jigsaw puzzle of the remaining fragments reveals that the Matelica picture was probably very similar to its model, but the man on the ladder was a new addition to the composition.</p></div>

He is probably a shepherd too: they were traditionally shown seated on the ground playing the instrument (see <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EEU-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Angel appearing to Saint Joachim</a></span> for another example).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the background, immediately behind the angels, a group of people gather in an open structure that resembles a Roman temple, with columns and a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK5-0008-0000-0000.htm">pediment</a>. If you look closely, you‘ll see a row of figures behind a bench who seem to be scribbling notes. This is probably a reference to the opening verses of Luke’s nativity story, which describes how Caesar Augustus, the Roman Emperor, had ordered all citizens of the Roman Empire to enrol in a census for taxation (Luke 2: 1–5).  The scene is rare in images of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a>, but it was the motivation for Mary and Joseph to travel to Bethlehem, where Christ was born.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a> describes how Signorelli made this painting ’with love and design‘. Design (’<span class="dokuwiki_italic">disegno</span>‘) was a crucial aspect of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> painting in central Italy, where painters were more concerned with drawing than with colouring.  The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> of paintings was often very detailed, and there were many preliminary drawings. Signorelli’s study for the group of shepherds is at the British Museum. It is covered with a grid, probably to help him copy it to scale for the painting; specks of green paint on the paper suggest that he had it close to hand as he was painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The semicircle of adoring figures is carefully arranged to draw our attention to Christ; you can follow the standing shepherd’s gaze down his staff to the face of the second kneeling shepherd, who is looking towards the infant. Signorelli trained with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piero della Francesca</a> whose interest in mathematics and geometry is reflected in this careful arrangement of the figures. He has also paid attention to detail – the delicately painted flowers in the foreground include a clump of wild strawberries, symbolising the fruitful and righteous life of Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Signorelli has signed his name on the building where the census is taking place: LVCE . DE CORTONA. P.[ICTORIS] O.[PUS], (’work of Luca of Cortona, painter').</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Following Jewish tradition, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQK-0008-0000-0000.htm">circumcised</a> when he was eight days old (Luke 2: 21). Seated on his mother’s lap, Christ reaches out to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">mohel</span>, the man who will perform the surgery, who holds a fine blade between his wiry fingers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>’s husband, looks on, his serious expression reinforcing the solemnity of the occasion. The old man raising his hands in an almost ecstatic pose in the background is Simeon, one of the first people to recognise Christ’s divinity (Luke 2:25–35).<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q12-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Signorelli</a> has painted him wearing a gold-woven cope, as though he were a high-ranking Catholic cleric. The two other men, by contrast, wear striped turbans, Signorelli’s shorthand for biblical dress; they may represent Jewish priests or elders. The one on the right, touches the tip of his finger, perhaps in allusion to the circumcision.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject was chosen by the patrons, the Confraternity of the Holy Name of Jesus, who were connected with the church of San Francesco, Volterra. The group was founded in 1424 after a visit by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2H-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Bernardino of Siena</a>, who had preached a sermon in the city in 1424. Saint Bernardino was famously devoted to the name of Jesus, creating the trigram IHS (the first three letters of Jesus’s name in Greek) which often featured as a focus of devotion. The scene was a way of expressing this devotion through narrative, since it was when the infant Christ was given his name: Jesus.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis undertaken when the painting was restored in the 1960s revealed that Christ’s pose was altered three times. The child as we see him now is the invention of a different artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sodoma</a>, who was working in Volterra in the late 1530s. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a> claimed Sodoma’s intervention was due to damage to the original from damp, but we can‘t be sure. Signorelli has signed the picture at the bottom edge: LVCAS / CORTONENSIS / PINXIT (’Luca from Cortona painted this').</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was intended to look like an extension of the chapel in which it was installed so that viewers felt they were seeing the event as it happened. The figures are set beneath a half dome, a common feature of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> chapels, which usually crowned the altar upon which pictures like this stood. The walls are painted with swirls of bright paint in imitation of marble; the circular reliefs in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCA-0008-0000-0000.htm">spandrels</a> represent a prophet and a sibyl who foretold Christ’s coming. The vibrantly coloured marble floor tiles are designed to attract the viewer’s attention, and the white borders lead the eye towards the central focus of the image, the infant Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s blood shed at the circumcision was seen as a precursor to his sacrifice at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. The basin placed in the centre of the composition, ready to collect the blood, might stand in for the chalice from which Christians would drink wine – thought to transform into Christ’s blood – at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>.</p></div>
