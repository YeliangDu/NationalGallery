Her halo is inscribed in Latin with the words the Archangel Gabriel said to her at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>: ‘Hail Mary full of Grace.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ plays with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERT-0008-0000-0000.htm">rosary</a> of red beads which also winds through his mother’s fingers. A small open book rests on the cloth – it is inscribed with the opening verses of Matins, the first of the daily hours of prayer in the Catholic Church. On the right, you can see the large gold ‘D’ of the word ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Domine</span>’, from ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Domine labia mea aperis</span>’ (‘Lord open my lips’). These still, calm figures are typical of the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrogio Bergognone</a>, one of the leading Milanese painters of the late fifteenth century. His style, in particular the silvery-grey skin tones, is reminiscent of the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vincenzo Foppa</a>, who was perhaps his teacher.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the background you can see monks in white habits strolling in the grounds of a large church, one accompanied by a layman and his dog. The monks are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Carthusians</a>, and the church is the Certosa (Charterhouse) of Pavia, where Bergognone worked from the late 1480s. You can see the front of the building under construction to the right of the Virgin’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a>. The unfinished facade is depicted as it appeared in the late 1480s, down to the rough unfinished masonry, the exposed beams and the small arches at the outer edges which were to become the double row of arcades. There is even a temporary shelter for workmen across the front. It’s almost as if Bergognone was actually painting in front of the church itself, 300 years before <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFY-0008-0000-0000.htm">plein-air</a> painting was made popular by the<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Impressionists</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Certosa was one of the largest monasteries in Italy, and one of the most spectacular projects of the Duke of Milan, Ludovico il Moro. Bergognone was effectively the Certosa’s house painter in the late 1480s and early 1490s. He produced several <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpieces</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> there, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FII-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saint Catherine of Alexandria and Saint Catherine of Siena</a></span>, as well as designing inlaid woodwork for the choir stalls.

He created a guide of intersecting lines on this panel, allowing him to paint objects and figures at the correct scale relative to each other so they appear to be in a realistic three-dimensional space.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small, portable picture has all the solemnity of a large altarpiece, despite being an independent image that was probably made for private devotion. Though the figures are tiny, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PHG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bramantino</a> wanted viewers to feel small in their presence – an effect he has achieved through their sturdiness, symmetrical arrangement and grand and dignified poses.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bramantino’s paintings are known for the originality of their design, and this scene of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a>, described in the Gospel of Matthew (2: 1–11), is so unusual that it’s not entirely clear who the figures are intended to represent. Usually images of the Adoration show the kings grouped together, often kneeling in front of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>. Here, instead, we can see two of them standing proudly before the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a> and Child, presenting their gifts in large containers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Since only two of the figures hold objects that might contain gifts, it is difficult to know which of the other figures is also a king. As one of them was sometimes shown as a Black African man, some have identified the man standing to the left of the Virgin, pointing towards her, as the third king. But this figure has also been associated with the Old Testament prophet Isaiah, who foretold the birth of Christ; if that’s so, maybe the final king is the man with the blue turban on the right. The figure with the lion-like mane of hair who looks straight out towards us is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>, whose role was to foretell Christ’s ministry. It is unusual to see him in this scene but his baptism of Christ is celebrated on 6 January – the same day that the visit of the Three Kings is celebrated.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bramantino was also an architect, and was fascinated by linear perspective – he even wrote a treatise on the subject (now lost). X-ray images show that he incised a grid of intersecting lines into the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB6-0008-0000-0000.htm">gesso</a> before beginning to paint – if you look closely at the picture from below you can see these incisions. The grid matches the specific method for drawing in perspective invented by the Renaissance architect, painter and theorist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0RBJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leon Battista Alberti</a>. It allowed Bramantino to paint the objects and figures at the correct scale in relation to each other and their distance from the viewer, making it seem like they are in a realistic three-dimensional space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It might seem surprising given his passion for order – and architecture – that the scene is set within a crumbling house. Its crumbling edges, however, soften the effect of the picture’s strict geometry. The landscape background – which he painted freely, changing his mind several times – adds variety, the vast rock formations enduring while the built architecture crumbles. A tiny angel hovers on a cloud above a precipice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When this work was first acquired it was thought to be by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a>. Both painters were inspired by the art of ancient Greece and Rome, seen here in the architecture and the objects on the ground which resemble ancient tombs; both painted draperies with deep, crisp folds. Unlike Mantegna, Bramantino used <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> which, because it dries slowly, allowed him to blend colours more easily. He was able to create subtle effects, for example mimicking the effect of light falling on fabric – we see this in the green tones of the king on the right’s cloak which are brighter where the light hits him.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With this painting, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Costa</a> invented a type of image that would become very popular in northern Italy, particularly Venice, in the sixteenth-century – look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5P-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Music Lesson</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GAH-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Concert</a></span>, for example. While pictures of people playing musical instruments and singing are now often called ‘concerts’, they may have been intended to depict private moments.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The band of singers is engrossed in the camaraderie of their music; as she sings, the young woman keeps time by tapping her fingers against the marble ledge and her companion’s shoulder. He is deep in concentration, his eyes lowered towards the open book containing the musical composition – its notes have only been roughly sketched in. His lute, by contrast, has an elaborately carved rosette which has been painted with great attention to detail. The young man behind him appears to be straining to reach or hold a note and he too is tapping time on the ledge.  The trio’s concentration and exertion are tangible, and the intensity of the moment is enhanced by the deep black background. The song is perhaps a complex one. It might be a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">frottola</span> – a three-part song written for tenor, soprano and bass accompanied by a lute.  The woman’s dress, with its cloth of gold sleeves and jewelled gold collar, provides some luxurious embellishment to an otherwise stark image.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The small violin-like instrument is a rebec; a recorder leans across it. The end of the rebec projects over the edge of the ledge, adding an extra dimension of space to the image – the space between us and the ledge. The inclusion of these instruments not only suggests the musical skill and versatility of the musicians but also the depth of the ledge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that the singers might be members of the Bentivoglio family, who commissioned an altarpiece – featuring their portraits – from Costa for the church of San Giacomo Maggiore, Bologna, at around this time. A painting in the Museo Nacional Thyssen-Bornemisza in Madrid shows a group of figures huddled around a sheet of music, and includes inscriptions identifying them as members of the Bentivoglio family; the comparison with the faces of our musicians is not entirely convincing. As the score and musical instruments aren‘t painted with complete accuracy, some have suggested that the picture could have been intended as an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> representation of Harmony or the art of music. But it seems most likely that the picture was made to entertain an educated and wealthy patron who, like his contemporaries, embraced the fashion for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cantare a libro</span> (’singing from a book’), a developing trend in northern Italy. We know from surviving fifteenth-century letters that members of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Este family</a>, the rulers of Ferrara, for example, enjoyed performing together for their own or others' entertainment.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man in this portrait appears to have just turned away from the darkness surrounding him to take a look at us. His lips are slightly parted as though he might speak. He seems to be examining us – or rather the artist – with interest, his head slightly tilted. The striking contrast of his red hair against his plum-coloured tunic almost distracts our attention from the warts on his cheek. His cap is such a deep aubergine purple that it is hardly visible against the black background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An inscription on the back of the panel names the man as Battista Fiera, doctor at the court of Mantua as well as a poet. We can‘t be sure it’s really him, but it was thought to be in the seventeenth century: an engraving based on the painting formed the frontispiece (first page) of an edition of Fiera’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Coena notis</span> published in 1649. He was more successful as a doctor than a poet, becoming official physician to the Marquis and Marchioness of Mantua – the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TZV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gonzaga family</a> – in 1508.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Fiera’s writings show that he was interested in the city’s artists and artistic projects. He featured <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> (Costa’s predecessor as court artist to the Gonzaga) in a poem about the best way to represent the concept of justice in painting, and others seem to refer to now-lost paintings by the artist. Fiera also wrote about his admiration for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Costa</a>. He didn’t just observe the cultural life of the city from afar, however. He acted as an adviser to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TP8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Isabella d‘Este, Marchioness of Mantua</a>, in her plan to erect a statue of the city’s most famous citizen, the ancient poet Virgil, for which she had Mantegna make designs. He also paid for the refurbishment of one of the city’s arches, commissioning three terracotta sculptures of the heads of Francesco II Gonzaga, the modern Mantuan poet Battista Spagnoli and Virgil. He clearly had an affinity for classical antiquity and learning: in his will he expressed a desire to be buried beneath this arch, dressed in a toga and holding a book.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Costa had become court artist in 1506 and this portrait was once thought to have been made when his and Fiera’s residencies coincided. We know that the artist was suffering from a venereal disease in 1508 and it’s tempting to think that he might have received treatment from Fiera and offered him this painting in recompense – but Costa himself, writing to his employer Marchese Francesco II Gonzaga, revealed that his doctor was called Antonio da Grato. In any case, this portrait is much closer in style to another of Costa’s paintings in our collection, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFC-0001-0000-0000.htm"> A Concert</a></span>, which dates to 1488–90. In both Costa used strong contrasts of light and shade to make the face appear solid and three-dimensional.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If this is a portrait of Battista Fiera, it might be the ’picture of the said late Battista' listed as being in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">studiolo</span> (study) in an inventory of his possessions made three days after his death in January 1540.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1980, when this painting was cleaned and restored, it was discovered to be assembled from fragments. It is part of a circular painting (tondo) on wood that was originally made as a ceiling decoration. It was commissioned in 1524 by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Alfonso I d’Este</a>, Duke of Ferrara, and painted for the Camera del Poggiolo (balcony room) in the Estense Castle, connected to the ducal palace, in Ferrara. Originally it had five figures. The other surviving fragment, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Boy with a Basket of Flowers</span>, is now in the Fondazione Longhi in Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the National Gallery’s painting, two figures, a woman and a man with his hand over her shoulder, lean over a parapet. The figures are painted as if seen from below with what must have been startlingly sharp definition. The woman, whose blonde curls are crowned with a wreath of jasmine, appears to be speaking or singing to the man beside her. The surviving fragment of her hand suggests she was perhaps about to drop something into our space below. The man wears a black jacket and cap and has a sprig of jasmine tucked behind his left ear. The boy in the Fondazione Longhi fragment is laughing and looks as though he is about to tip the flowers from his basket on our heads. The flowers are painted with remarkable accuracy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The blue of the sky would also have been repeated in the coffering of the ceiling, where it was used as a background for gold rosettes. Technical examination reveals that the ultramarine sky in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dosso</a>’s tondo was painted on top of another background, possibly of imaginary architecture. Documents record that Dosso received copious quantities of ultramarine for this painting, so it is likely that he painted the sky on top of the earlier background, probably as a result of the decision to decorate the ceiling blue.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The tradition of ingenious ceiling decorations to which this tondo belongs originated with the ceiling that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Mantegna</a> painted in the Camera Picta (painted room) of the ducal palace in Mantua between 1465 and 1474. This features a painted oculus (literally ‘eye’), or imaginary circular opening to the sky, with people and cherubs looking over a parapet into the room below. Such decorations often featured members of the household and were humorous or festive in character. Examples existed in several north Italian cities by the 1520s and were certainly to be seen in Ferrara where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Garofalo</a> produced examples in the Palazzo Costabili (about 1506) and Palazzo Sacrati (1519).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A 1650 description of Dosso’s tondo said that it included ‘a portrait of il Gonella, who is an old man as well as a great character.’ Pietro Gonnella or Gonella (1390–1441), was the most famous of the many dwarves attached to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Este</a> court. Although he lived in the fifteenth century, his fame was such that the nickname Gonella was given to other court dwarves during the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a>. The man in the National Gallery’s fragment may be Gonella, though he may have been one of the two figures now missing from the tondo. All knowledge of the original meaning of the painting has been lost.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young man in this portrait has been identified as Bartolomeo Bianchini, a nobleman and humanist scholar from Bologna. He is portrayed against an imaginary landscape of jagged rocks and grassy plains, and we appear to have interrupted him reading a letter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The text of the letter is written in a neat script that shows through the paper but cannot be read by us. Envelopes were not used for letters at this time and the name of the recipient was written on the centre of the back of the paper, which would have remained visible when the letter was folded. Bartolomeo Bianchini’s name is written in brown ink on the central part of the paper, which would have been the outside. Bianchini was a friend of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francia</a> and an admirer of his work. He commissioned him to paint a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family</span>, which is now in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don‘t know of any other earlier use of a letter as a means of naming the sitter in an Italian portrait. However it is seen in Netherlandish portraiture, for example in the portrait of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CMR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marco Barbarigo</a> made by a follower of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> in the 1430s. Usually the writing identifies the artist and attests to his skill rather than identifies the sitter. The strong realism of Netherlandish portraits, made possible by the use of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>, was an important influence on artists working in northern Italy and Venice at this time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bianchini’s hand appears to project over the stone ledge or parapet into our space. The ledge creates the impression that we are looking through a window into a real space, and the hand reaching out into our space enhances this illusion. This use of the ledge in portraiture can be traced back at least as far as Jan van Eyck’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CP2-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait inscribed ’Leal Souvenir'</a> and it is common to many Netherlandish portraits, particularly those by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Memling</a>, some of which were known in Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The central fold of the letter seems to project beyond the front plane of the picture, breaking the boundary between the picture and reality. The letter is like the pieces of paper also with creases we see apparently stuck to the front of the ledge in other portraits, such as that of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ Blessing</a></span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello da Messina</a> painted in Venice 30 years earlier. These are painted to create the illusion of being real paper stuck on the painting to trick the viewer and show off the artist’s skill.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In its format, composition and setting, Francia’s portrait seems to be based on one by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OWS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francesco del  Cossa</a> now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid. In Francia’s portrait, the gentle curves of the grassy hills echo Bianchini’s sloping shoulders, plump chin, rounded cap and collar. The very slender trees are similar to ones by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>, whose style influenced Francia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lighting from the right in this portrait is unusual, indicating that it might once have been paired with a companion picture  lit from the left – perhaps a portrait of the friend who wrote the letter.</p></div>

There’s a branch of laurel attached to the wall at the back, a symbol of victory; Federico was a noted military commander. On the arch of the throne are Kufic letters which perhaps relate to Persian musical theory.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young man is dressed in the height of fifteenth-century fashion. His jacket is made of figured cloth-of-silver patterned in green and edged with fur. The right sleeve is extravagantly slashed, with golden eyelets in the hem of the slash. The gap is held together with three tasselled ribbons, the middle one of which is left undone to show a red doublet, which is itself slashed to reveal his linen shirt. His red cap lies on the steps. It was  usual for the liberal arts to be shown as enthroned women, often with exponents of their arts seated below or beside them. Music was traditionally accompanied by Tubalcain, a biblical figure known for being the first blacksmith, but it is difficult to believe this expensively dressed young man is assuming the role of a smith. This was once thought to have been a portrait of Federico’s son and successor, Guidobaldo, but he was only born in 1472. It might be his brother-in-law, Costanzo Sforza, who was born in 1447.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don‘t know where the series was meant to be displayed – perhaps Federico’s library at Urbino – but the panels were originally much larger and were designed to be hung high up on the wall.

She is strongly lit from the right, as is the organ. There was presumably a window in the wall to her right, so the lighting in the painting mimicked the light in the room.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows some <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, including the man’s head, which was originally drawn in somewhat lower and to the right of where it is painted.

The youth at her feet, while not a portrait in a conventional sense, may possibly represent the Duke’s son, Guidobaldo, then a child.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Music</a></span> comes from the same series, though not from the same <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a>: the boards which make up the panel of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rhetoric</span> run vertically, while those of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Music</span> run horizontally. The perspective indicates that they were hung above eye level. The figure of Rhetoric seems to have originally appeared between images of Grammar and Dialectic (once in Berlin, but destroyed in 1945). Together the three made up the trivium, one group of the liberal arts. They were painted on a single, very large panel which was cut into segments at an unknown date. We can tell that Rhetoric was in the middle as her throne is shown directly from the front, and the perspective lines of the textile on the steps converge towards a single vanishing point.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The style of the architecture, the lettering and the clothing are all in the Italian taste and the perspectival tricks, such as objects appearing to project from the steps, are found more commonly in Italian than Netherlandish paintings. However, the rules of perspective are not accurately applied. Justus seems to have been adapting his style to suit Italian tastes, and the basic compositional scheme would have been suggested by the patron and his architect to conform to the architecture of the room.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the artist had a very sophisticated command of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> technique, he seems to have had difficulty in obtaining the right materials for oil painting in Italy. The panels are poplar, the usual material for Italian painting, which is much inferior to the oak Justus would have been familiar with. It was presumably also difficult to get carefully prepared oils. The paint layer is very thin in places and gives the impression of having been applied very fast; Justus was perhaps struggling to complete a number of projects at the same time for an impatient patron. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB6-0008-0000-0000.htm">gesso</a> has also discoloured, probably because it contains too much glue, and the whole surface is obscured by thick, yellow-brown layers of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR1-0008-0000-0000.htm">varnishes</a>, dirt and wax, presumably from candles in the room in which it was placed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are drawings in black paint on the back, apparently made before the planks were assembled into a panel: they stop at the joins. They show a nude man and parts of a horse. They were hastily done and are possibly the work of an assistant.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A woman drinks from a large goblet; she looks up with resolve in her eyes, as though she has just made a noble toast. We don‘t know exactly who she is, but it’s likely she is the ill-fated but brave Carthaginian princess, Sophonisba, whose turbulent life and tragic death were recorded by several Roman writers including the historian Livy. Many centuries later, her story inspired the fourteenth-century Italian poet Petrarch to celebrate her in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumph of Love</span>, as well as his poem about the Second Punic War (entitled simply, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Africa</span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The goblet contains poison sent to Sophonisba by her new husband, Massinia, the ruler of eastern Numidia. In 206 BC Massinia allied with the Roman general Scipio to defeat the western Numidians, ruled by Sophonisba’s first husband, Syphax. But Massinia fell in love with Sophonisba the moment they met; she was, according to Petrarch, very fair, with golden hair and a complexion like lilies and roses. Massinia married her but could not dissuade Scipio from his plan to parade her in Rome as a victory trophy. In order to spare her this humiliation he sent her poison, which we see her drink here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Other than the goblet, the only clue to her identity is her costume: Mantegna has conveyed her exoticism through her clothes and accessories, which include a headdress with a turban covered by a loose veil and a pleated neck covering. The outfit is finished off with a dangling pearl earring. The context in which she was originally displayed would also have helped: it is very likely that this panel was painted as a pair to Mantegna’s image of the Vestal Virgin <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tuccia</a>. Both are painted in imitation of gilded bronze against a pink and white background painted to look like marble. This panel seems to have been cut down at the long edges and so was probably made with the same dimensions as the panel showing Tuccia. Both may have been made as part of the decoration of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">studiolo</span> (study) of Mantegna’s patron <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TP8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Isabella d’Este</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mantegna has emphasised the rigidity of the figure by painting it as though lit by a strong light coming from the left. This allowed him to make utmost use of the limited colours by painting the areas hit by this imaginary light – the tips of the folds of the drapery, for example – as bright and gleaming, and the creases, which are in shadow, much darker. The sharp contrasts increase the illusion that the figure is in fact sculpted – actual fabric would not fold in such a stiff way. Mantegna is showing off here: his skill was so great that he could use paint alone to create a figure that looks as hard and solid as a bronze relief.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Samson</a>, the Israelite hero of the Old Testament, is overcome by sleep; limbs limp and mouth open, we can almost hear him snoring. Delilah, his lover, is busy shearing off his curly hair, which gathers in tufts on the ground beside him. Lured by a bribe from the Philistines, Israel’s neighbours and enemies, Delilah agreed to collaborate in Samson’s capture, and cut off the source of his legendary strength – his hair – while he slept (Judges 16:18–21). Her treachery is underlined by the Latin inscription carved into the tree: ‘woman is three times worse than the devil himself.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> made a number of images of famous women from the Bible and classical literature. Chosen as examples from history of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HHC-0001-0000-0000.htm">virtue</a> or vice (as in the case of Delilah), Mantegna emphasised the timelessness of their moral message by painting them to look like ancient stone or bronze reliefs. Here, he has added colour and drama while maintaining the illusion that the whole object is made of stone. The scene is set against a vibrant background – swirls of grey and orange paint resemble a slice of polished variegated marble or a cameo (a relief carved from a shell or semi-precious stone). Either way, the colours and shapes suggest the flames of hell.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By contrast, the scene itself appears serene and idyllic. Samson and Delilah are dressed in ancient Roman draperies which slip loosely from their bodies, hinting at pleasure and rest. Mantegna has suggested the sound of running water coming from the fountain which flows into a small stream; Samson is slumped next to a clump of irises and behind him is a lemon tree bearing fruit. The tree has no leaves of its own and one of its branches has been cut, but a luscious vine, heavy with ripe grapes, encircles it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The grapes may refer to the wine of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>, drunk at Mass by Christians in commemoration of Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">death</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">resurrection</a>, and thought to transform into Christ’s blood. Like Samson, Christ was betrayed – by his disciple, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a> – and handed over to his enemies; unlike Samson, his death was believed to redeem humanity from the sin passed down from Adam and Eve, who were tempted by the devil to eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge. The tree might represent the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F98-0008-0000-0000.htm">Fall of Man</a>, and the grapes redemption through Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Samson and Delilah is included in a contemporary text called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Der Ritter von Turm</span>. Written in the fourteenth century as a set of moral examples – good and bad –  to young women, it associates Delilah specifically with Judas. It seems likely that Mantegna was inspired by this text because this image is very similar to the woodcut illustrations made by the influential German artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>, to accompany its 1493 edition. The motif of the tree and the grapes transforms the image into a message of Christian salvation: while Samson was overcome by Delilah, Christ was not defeated by Judas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture may have been made as a pair to an image of Judith and Holofernes (National Gallery of Ireland, Dublin). Both have the same dimensions and both are painted on fine linen using pigments mixed with glue. In this pairing, Delilah serves as an example of bad behaviour, while Judith – a Jewish heroine who slayed Holofernes, the fearsome Philistine – is a good one. It has been suggested that these two pictures were painted for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TP8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Isabella d‘Este, Marchioness of Mantua</a>, but we can’t be certain.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For many years, this picture was known as the ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Imperator Mundi</span>’ – the Ruler of the World. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> is shown standing on the ledge of an oval structure, perhaps a well. He holds a crystal orb topped with jewels in his left hand and an olive branch in his right; he looks like a king or a Roman emperor. His very fine tunic clings to his body and we can see his little pot belly beneath it. One diagonal fold, running from his right leg to his left shoulder, recalls the folds of a Roman toga.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s cousin, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>, stands to his right. He looks out towards us, pointing at Christ, an indication of his role as his forerunner – the one who foretold the significance of Christ’s life and death. The scroll that unfurls around his leg was originally inscribed with the words he spoke about Christ as he baptised him: Ecce Agnus Dei (Latin for ‘Behold the Lamb of God’, John 1: 29). It was common for lambs and goats to be sacrificed to God; in the Christian tradition Christ took on the role and, by dying, redeemed the sin of humanity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two toddlers dominate the scene: through their gestures, clothing and the objects they hold, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> tells the whole story of Christian redemption through Christ. Christ’s parents, the<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, appear to have been squeezed in at the last minute, but Mary’s unusual position and gesture may also be significant. An engraving of the image dating to the early nineteenth century shows the Virgin holding an olive branch in her right hand; in the late nineteenth century this was removed by a restorer who replaced it with a book (thinking, perhaps, that since she’s looking down, she must originally have been reading).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Once the picture joined our collection, technical analysis showed there was no evidence that she ever held a book and it was removed. By comparing this image with others by Mantegna (for example, the version in the Petit Palais, Paris) and one by his pupil Caroto, it seems more likely that the Virgin is sewing – both of these show her in a similar pose but with a needle. The Virgin shown sewing may be a reference to her humility.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another unusual aspect of this picture is the Virgin’s position: if the object is a well, then it looks as though Mantegna has placed the Virgin within it. This might be a reference to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fons signata</span> (‘closed well’) which is described in Song of Solomon (4: 12), and which became a symbol of Mary’s sealed womb – and so her virginity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While small-scale images of the Virgin holding Christ in her arms were common and popular in Italian painting, similarly compact pictures showing the whole family or focusing on specific moments in Christ’s life, such as his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CR3-0001-0000-0000.htm">circumcision</a>, were new – one of Mantegna’s many innovations. Like many of Mantegna’s paintings in our collection, it is painted on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> rather than <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> (which was more common in this period). The paint surface is particularly worn and the canvas shows through in areas, giving it a slightly faded appearance.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was part of a classical-style frieze made for Francesco Cornaro, a Venetian nobleman, in celebration of his ancestors, the ancient Roman Cornelia family. Mantegna painted the figures to look as though they are carved from stone, not painted, and set against colourful marble.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 204 BC the Romans introduced the goddess Cybele to the city for worship. On the far left we see the goddess – she is represented by the spherical stone on the litter. According to the Roman writer Juvenal, she fell to earth as a meteor. Mantegna has included a sculpted bust of Cybele beside it. Cornaro’s ancestor Publius Scipio Cornelius Nasica was chosen – as the worthiest man in Rome – to officially receive the goddess.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mantegna planned and prepared another four canvases, but completed only this one before his death in 1506. Cornaro commissioned Giovanni Bellini to make at least one more (now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By the time <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> made this picture – at the very end of career – he was well known for his skill in imitating sculpture in paint (a technique he himself had invented). Using just black and white paint applied with the tip of his brush, Mantegna made his figures seem as though they were carved from stone rather than painted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> painters were constantly vying with sculptors to produce the most compelling and lifelike works of art. Mantegna has added white paint to the creases of the folded draperies of the figure’s robes, making them appear sharp, as though made of stone, not fabric. At the same time, the gestures and facial expressions are more dramatic and subtle than anything that could be captured in sculpture, Mantegna proving the superiority of his art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene is set against a swirling orange and grey background painted in imitation of polished variegated marble. This type of picture reflected Mantegna’s own fascination with the art and culture of ancient Rome, and the fashion for this kind of object among his wealthy clients. This picture is part of a commission from Francesco Cornaro, a Venetian nobleman, for a frieze to decorate a room in his palace. We know from a letter dated 15 March 1505 that Francesco’s brother Marco asked the permission of Mantegna’s patron, Francesco <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TZV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gonzaga</a>, to commission the artist to make the series of works required. Each painting was based on classical sources, and together they would celebrate Cornaro’s ancestors, the ancient Roman Cornelia family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 204 BC the Romans introduced the goddess Cybele to the city for worship; this panel shows the procession that marked her arrival. On the far left we see the goddess – she is represented by the spherical stone on the litter carried by a group of men as, according to the Roman writer Juvenal, she fell to earth as a meteor. Mantegna also included a sculpted bust of the goddess on this litter; she wears a crown that resembles fortified city walls. According to the Roman writers who recorded this event, she was accompanied by priests from her cult centre in Asia Minor. Mantegna has expressed their exotic backgrounds by dressing them in turbans, and robes over trousers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This occurred in the final years of the Second Punic War – the conflict between Rome and Carthage (present-day Tunisia). When a meteorite shower struck Rome, people feared it was a bad omen and consulted the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sibylline Books</span>, an ancient book of prophecies, for advice. The books were interpreted as suggesting that the only way to expel the Carthaginians would be to bring Cybele to Rome and establish a centre for her worship there.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The episode was important for the Cornaro family as their ancestor Publius Scipio Cornelius Nasica was chosen – as the worthiest man in Rome – to officially receive the goddess. It’s even thought that he hosted her in his home for several days before she was finally installed at her new site of worship. This is underlined by the inscription beneath the image: S HOSPES NUMINIS IDAEI C (‘Host to the Idean deity’ – Cybele was worshipped on Mount Ida in Anatolia, modern-day Turkey). SC stands for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Senatus Consulto</span>, meaning ‘with permission of the Senate’. The litter that bears the goddess passes between two unusually shaped brick structures with Latin inscriptions: the tombs of Scipio’s father and uncle, another nod to the Cornelia family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mantegna wove together a number of literary sources to create the image. The woman shown wailing on her knees in front of the litter may be Claudia Quinta. According to Ovid’s account she miraculously rescued the boat which was carrying the goddess to Rome, which hit ground just outside the port of Ostia near Rome. Claudia Quinta was the only one who could pull it to shore (she argued that the miracle proved her chastity, which had recently been doubted). Once the goddess arrived at the gates of Rome, she was greeted by a group of Roman senators, including Scipio: he may be the figure standing behind who turns to talk to a companion while gesturing towards, but turning his face away from, Claudia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The large entourage that has arrived to welcome the goddess includes musicians – the drummer at the far right looks out of the picture, perhaps into another scene; letters reveal that Mantegna planned and prepared another four canvases. However, he completed only this one before his death in 1506, after which Cornaro commissioned Giovanni Bellini to make at least one more (National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.). The bottom right portion of the painting was originally cut down at an angle, suggesting it might have been placed against a chimney breast.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Looking around tentatively and taking careful steps with slightly bent knees, a woman walks towards us, holding what at first glance looks like a deep circular tray. If we look more closely we can see that the contents of the vessel are softly rippling. The woman is the Vestal Virgin Tuccia and the object she carries is, in fact, a sieve.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Vestal Virgins maintained the fire in the temple of the chaste goddess Vesta in Rome. Their virginity was crucial, but Tuccia’s was challenged. In order to prove it, and knowing that she would have divine assistance, she gathered water from the river Tiber in a sieve and carried it to the temple of Vesta. She predicted – correctly – that none of it would be lost, and that this would prove her virginity to her accusers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was most probably <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HHC-0001-0000-0000.htm">made as a pair</a> to our picture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FU7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sophonisba</a>. Both are painted to imitate bronze relief sculptures set against a pink and white marble background. Tuccia is crowned by an antique style vase filled with lilies – representing virginity – held up by ribbon and swags of foliage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike the figure of Sophonisba, who is portrayed as serene and immobile in celebration of her steadfast and determined character, Tuccia is shown in action, making careful steps to prevent the contents of the sieve from spilling. Mantegna has reinforced the tension and suspense of her journey by showing her robes and veil rippling in the breeze as she advances. He painted Tuccia as though lit from the right, which allowed him to make the most of the limited colours, creating dramatic variations in tone between areas hit by the light and areas cast in shadow. This technique emphasised the three-dimensionality of the figure. Mantegna was showing that he could rival the work of sculptors by imitating their material so brilliantly – and by making the sculpture look as though it was moving.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tuccia was celebrated in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumph of Chastity</span> by the fourteenth-century Italian poet, Petrarch.  As a virtuous woman from ancient history, she was a popular subject in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> painting.

An unfurling scroll is inscribed with the words John spoke about Christ just before he baptised him: ‘Behold the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world’ (John 1: 29).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> has painted the figures as though they stand before us. John the Baptist’s skin is tanned, he has stubble around his jaw and his bones show through his skin – he is emaciated after his time in the wilderness prophesying the coming of Christ. He wears a simple tunic made from an animal hide, its rugged edge curling over around the neck and arms. Mary Magdalene looks up towards heaven and raises up a small pot, a reminder of the spices that she anointed Christ’s body with after his death. Her full, fair curls and the way the light hits her neck and chest make her look like a sculpted marble statue of an ancient goddess.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mantegna has adopted the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">contrapposto</span> pose of classical sculpture, first revived in sculpture by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a> (whose work Mantegna encountered in Padua). This asymmetrical pose, where the body curves gently as though the figure is swaying, makes them appear light and graceful. It is most obvious in the naked figure of Christ. The figures‘ draperies are a striking focus point – all three are wrapped in volumes of cloth which reveal the shape of their bodies. The knees and thighs of the Virgin and Mary Magdalene are revealed and concealed by the fabric, in the same way as ancient sculptures of goddesses. Mary Magdalene’s dress, with its multiple folds and pleats, especially recalls the arrangement of draperies of ancient statues. In this way the figures are imbued with the dignity and status of the art of antiquity, as well as appealing to the contemporary taste for these kinds of objects. The network of jagged lines created by these folds adds pattern and detail to the central part of the picture; the bright colours, the apples in the trees, and the plants and grasses springing from the rocky soil add vibrancy to the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These appealing details contrast with the sombre anchor of the scene, the Virgin Mary. Her solemn expression as she rests her head against that of her child is one of maternal tenderness, but also an indication of her grief to come. Along with John the Baptist’s cross and Mary Magdalene’s ointment, it is a reminder of the fate of her son: his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a> and death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of altarpiece, where the holy figures are shown together, occupying the same imaginary space, is known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sacra conversazione</span> . At the time, this format was relatively new in Venice, where it had been pioneered by Bartolomeo Vivarini and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZ2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Marco Zoppo</a>. It was developed to its fullest potential by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>. We don’t know which church this altarpiece was made for, but as it is painted on canvas rather than wooden panel Mantegna could have produced it in his studio in Mantua, rolled it up and sent it to wherever it was required. It is first documented in Milan.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The whole picture is contained within a black border, speckled with red – perhaps in imitation of a marble frame or window – which seems to have been cut down on three sides. Mantegna signed the inside of John’s scroll: ‘Andreas Mantinia C.P.F.’ The ‘F’ is for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fecit</span>, Latin for ‘made this’; the ‘C.P.’ may stand for ‘Comes Palatinus’, Count of the Palatine, a title given to Mantegna in 1469.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jesus sits at the head of the table, surrounded by his disciples, holding up a piece of bread, which he blesses: this is the Last Supper. Ercole’s skill at painting detail on a small scale is clear: each disciple has a different facial expression, and the transparent glasses, the carafes and the morsels of bread on the table are painted like a tiny still life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small panel has an unusual dual function. It was the central panel of a predella – the lowest part of an altarpiece – but evidence of a keyhole suggests that it was also the door of a hidden container housing the bread eaten at Mass. The image is appropriate for such a container, often known as a tabernacle, because at the Last Supper Jesus taught his disciples to eat bread and wine in memory of him, a rite that later became the Eucharist, or Holy Communion. To the panel’s right was Ercole’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Israelites gathering Manna</span>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel formed the centre of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HSR-0001-0000-0000.htm">a predella</a> – the lowest part of an altarpiece – which was probably made for the church of San Domenico, Ferrara. It was positioned beneath a large image of the dead <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> lying on his mother’s lap, and to its right was <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHV-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Israelites gathering Manna</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bread, which Christ holds in his hand and blesses, is the focus of this picture. We see the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FS8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Last Supper</a>, when Christ dined with his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> and asked them to eat bread and drink wine – his body and his blood – in remembrance of him. He also told them of his imminent death: he knew that one of them would betray him. As he speaks, the disciples pray, some with eyes closed, while others look up to heaven. Only one figure breaks the peaceful symmetry of the scene: sitting on the far right, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a>, scowling, looks away from Christ. He places his hand on the bench as though he is about to push himself up and rush off – Ercole’s way of showing that he was the one who would betray Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical analysis has revealed that there was once a hole in the left hand side of the panel. This was probably a keyhole, and the picture a door of a cupboard which contained the bread (the host) eaten at Mass. This function explains the depiction of the Last Supper and the panel’s unusual vertical shape; predella panels were usually horizontal. The image of the dead Christ on the main panel of the altarpiece was intended to focus prayer on Christ’s body and suffering, so it was suitable for the altarpiece to house the host. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HSR-0001-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece may have been made to commemorate Eleonora of Aragon</a>, the Duchess of Ferrara, who was particularly devoted to the worship of the host as well as meditation upon Christ’s suffering (known as his Passion).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ercole</a> was the court painter at Ferrara. This panel reveals the precision and skill that probably earned him the job. He painted with the detail of a miniaturist and here, in a small scale, he has created a scene that is both intimate and grand. Tabernacles that contained the host were very often sculpted from marble; some resembled miniature classical-style buildings, with carved pillars and triangular pediments (roofs). Ercole recreates these decorative and architectural details in paint, which allows him to create a richly coloured scene. The pink and grey marble paving slabs in front of the table invite us into the scene, while the depth of the archway that crowns Christ’s head like a semi-circular halo hints at mystery – perhaps that of transubstantiation, the belief in the transformation of the bread and wine into Christ’s body and blood at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The coloured marble is painted to look as though it is carved with images. Although they are quite faint, figures to the left of the violet pilasters could be shepherds adoring the Christ Child in a nativity scene. Above Christ’s head, the gilded relief in the lunette shows a pagan sacrifice, a reference to Christ’s own sacrifice which heralded a new relationship with God. Above Judas’s head is a scene showing the flight to Egypt, when Christ and his parents took refuge from King Herod who had vowed to kill him, emphasising that Judas’s betrayal led to Christ’s death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible that this scene held personal significance for the Duke of Ferrara who may have commissioned it. Every year on Maundy Thursday (the day before Easter Friday when the Crucifixion was remembered) the Duke would invite 13  men to his palace to reenact the Last Supper. The lavish interior of this little scene might be intended to reflect the ducal palace at Ferrara.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a panel from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HSR-0001-0000-0000.htm">the lower part of an altarpiece</a>, which is known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>. The central panel showing <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Institution of the Eucharist</a></span> is also in the National Gallery’s collection. People in a variety of poses – some crouching, others kneeling – scoop up what looks like pebbles into jars, bags and even aprons. The whole community have come to help – young and old, women and men, and mothers with their babies.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">They are the Jewish people, making their way from Egypt to the promised land of Israel, and the precious cargo they are scrabbling to gather is bread (called manna) that appeared miraculously every morning to feed them while they were in the desert. The story comes from Exodus: ‘The Lord said to Moses and Aaron who were leading the Jews, "Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you; and the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day."’ (Exodus 16: 4). When the bread appeared it looked like a covering of ground frost and by the afternoon it was no longer fresh; they had to gather up as much as they could early in the morning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Aaron and Moses are shown standing on the left, overseeing the activity. Their elegantly folded draperies and graceful gestures contrast with the solid figures of the Israelites, whose realistic poses are probably based on preliminary life drawings. In the foreground a woman sits on her red dress, revealing her bent legs and thighs; behind her a hefty woman greedily empties a jar into her mouth. Other figures, like the semi-naked man on the right with the pot on his head, look out of place by comparison. His stance may be inspired by classical sculpture, a learned reference that would have pleased a courtly patron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This biblical narrative was appropriate because the bread of heaven (manna) sent to sustain the Israelites was thought to be a precursor for the bread of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>: the body of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, eaten at Mass. The ‘heavenly bread’ of Jesus’s body was represented in the main panel of the altarpiece, once immediately above this: it showed Christ’s dead body on the lap of his grieving mother, surrounded by mourners. A scene showing the Last Supper, also called <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLN-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Institution of the Eucharist</a></span> was placed next to to this panel, further reinforcing the theme. It is possible that this scene also decorated a box where the bread eaten at the communion was stored.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The elaborate wooden structures with curtained walls in the background are the Jews' tents, pitched in the wilderness. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ercole</a> emphasises their temporary nature by showing one still under construction on the far left of the scene. The tents have been arranged so that they create a rhythmic backdrop to the scene; all the action takes place facing the viewer, creating the effect of a stage set. The Duke of Ferrara, who may have been the patron of this picture, would have been familiar with this kind of setting: he staged classical dramas at his palace in the city when huts like these would be assembled either inside the palace or in the courtyard.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture surface is fairly worn and looks less crisp than it would have originally; the image was transferred from its wooden panel to canvas in 1829. This has changed its appearance – a faint shadow between two of the tents on the left shows that there was once a mountain there, mirroring the one on the right. We know this from a sixteenth-century copy of the picture now in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Knees apart and hand placed confidently on her knee, this imperious lady looks down – but not at us. Her twisted pose is tense and defensive: she looks as though she is clasping an imaginary shield while showing off the luxurious fabric of her sleeve, woven with gold. Six dolphin-like creatures adorned with spikes and rubies for eyes guard her throne, baring sharp teeth. A scallop shell hung with coral and crystal beads crowns the maritime throne.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She once looked down from the walls of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">studiolo</span> (study) at Belfiore, the hunting retreat belonging to the dukes of Ferrara, part of a decorative scheme showing the nine Muses. The theme was chosen by Leonello d’Este, Duke of Ferrara, and was begun by a painter called Angelo da Siena. After Leonello’s death in 1450 and Angelo’s in 1456, Leonello’s brother Borso hired <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tura</a> to produce the work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Muses were mythological figures, the daughters of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a> and Mnemosyne (Memory). They embodied divine inspiration for the arts, each representing a specific art form. Leonello’s choice showed off his fashionable education in the culture of ancient Greece and Rome, which he received from the renowned humanist scholar Guarino da Verona. The subject provided artists with the opportunity to emulate the ancient poets who were revered as intellectual role models by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> patrons and painters. Indeed, Guarino was enthusiastic about the idea, writing to Leonello in 1447 in praise of the concept and offering his learned opinion on how to bring the Muses to life in painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The surviving Muses from the series, which are now housed in collections across Europe, largely ignore his advice, making it difficult to identify them with any certainty. Our figure has been identified as Calliope, the muse of poetry. The branch of cherries may refer to justice, a principle with which Calliope was sometimes associated. A manuscript illumination in a Bible owned by Borso shows Justice as a woman seated on a throne framed by similarly ferocious-looking dolphin-like creatures, and features a cherub eating cherries. The dolphins, which were also a decorative feature of the Palazzo Schifanoia (the ducal palace in Ferrara) were clearly significant, though we do not know what they represent.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> reveals that Tura painted this image over the top of another, partially completed design, possibly by Angelo da Siena. The original design also showed a woman seated on a throne but her pose was slightly different and – most significantly – the throne itself was far simpler: its only decoration was a row of plain columns, resembling the pipes of an organ, often leading to the idea that she originally represented Euterpe, the muse of music.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Analysis of the paint of the under layers shows that the original image was painted with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">egg tempera</a>. The final image was painted using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>, which was not widely used in Italy in the 1450s – this picture is the earliest Italian oil painting in the National Gallery’s collection. Tura used two types of oil, preferring walnut, which had a less yellow tone for the lighter colours, ensuring they would retain their brightness. He used translucent glazes over more opaque paint layers to create a depth of colour impossible to achieve in tempera. The technique is flawless and suggests knowledge of Netherlandish art, particularly the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a>, who perfected the technique. We know that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TR2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Este family</a> owned a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a> by Rogier showing the deposition of Christ. There is no evidence that Rogier himself visited Italy but it is possible that other Netherlandish artists, perhaps trained by him, were at the Ferrarese court.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Something – or someone – has interrupted the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>’s reading. The pages of the small Bible on her knee flap as she moves; she appears to recoil from whatever she can see over her right shoulder. The painting has been cut down on all four sides – Mary’s halo has been cut in half – and was probably part of a large image which included the angel Gabriel, the cause of her surprise.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gabriel brought her the news that she would conceive a child by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and that he would be the son of God (Luke 1: 26–38). If you look closely at the upper left-hand part of the picture, you'll see a series of fine lines incised into the panel. These once surrounded the dove of the Holy Ghost, often depicted emanating golden rays.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin is seated against the backdrop of a hazy wild landscape with rocky precipices on one side and an ordered city with bridges and classical-style buildings on the other. Her elaborate carved wooden seat is as much a feature of the picture as she is; these kinds of chairs were fashionable in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a>. It is transformed into a throne by the addition of a slender backrest and canopy, which is improbably small in relation to her head. To the right is a white marble <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5R-0008-0000-0000.htm">pilaster</a>, painted to look as though it has been carved with decorative foliage, its dark outlines confidently painted with a fine brush.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Strong dark lines can also be seen through the paint surface, particularly in the Virgin’s hands and neck. This is the design <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tura</a> drew onto the panel before he began to paint. He used repeated parallel lines to indicate the shape and volume of forms. Visible <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> is characteristic of Tura’s painting, partly because of the slightly rubbed surface of some of the works, but also because there was so much of it. It can also be seen very clearly in his painting of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>. His method of outlining features is very recognisable and can sometimes, as here, appear exaggerated and unnatural. This was probably a self-conscious decision, intended to distinguish him from other artists and to highlight his inventiveness. He favoured adding or over-emphasising curves in the outlines of physical features, so the Virgin’s ears and lips here, for example, are made up of several round and crescent shapes; her knuckles seem excessively bony.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The way in which her fingertips but not her palms touch in prayer resembles the work of the Netherlandish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> – see the gloved hands of the bishop on the right in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D1N-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Exhumation of Saint Herbert</a></span>. Tura’s painting technique also reflects that of Rogier, for his skill in using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>. Although this is a picture made much later than the finest example of Tura’s oil painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G25-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Muse (Calliope?)</a></span>, he has used <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">egg tempera</a> with a few areas painted using walnut oil.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture has suffered considerable damage, particularly in the Virgin’s face, due to a split in the wood. These areas of loss have been restored by the National Gallery’s conservation team.</p></div>
