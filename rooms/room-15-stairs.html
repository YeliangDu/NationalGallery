        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At first sight this looks like a busy scene sixteenth-century street scene. A young man sells poultry and other produce in the corner of a market square. In the foreground, baskets and barrels are piled with pigeons, ducks, chickens and other birds, both alive and dead, as well as round cheeses, eggs and what seem to be pats of butter wrapped in white cloth. The stallholder holds two hens by their legs, feathers from their flapping wings drifting down and settling on the coop below. His pink jacket is surprisingly rich for a street vendor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the left, a smartly dressed young woman – her detachable sleeves were once mauve, and her bodice and apron different shades of purple or purple-blue – grasps a handsome cockerel by its feet. She turns and look confidently out at us, as if we are standing next to her at the stall, and puts her hand possessively on a large brass jug. She seems to have been painted from the same model that appears in several other paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0RSC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Joachim Beuckelaer</a> – she is probably the woman on the left in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H9Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Four Elements: Earth</a></span>. Next to her, an older woman in a red jacket also has a basket ready for shopping; several other ladies, their higher status shown by their black mantles, stand behind. In the background other stall holders and their customers mill about in front of the brick buildings of a typical Netherlandish town. One woman is transporting cheeses on a sled, while other people unload goods from boats drawn up at the quay.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is more going on here than the daily shop. This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HRY-0001-0000-0000.htm">four large paintings</a> in which the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – are represented by food, with biblical scenes in the background. Here we can see the prodigal son, in red trousers, disporting himself with the market women – he’s wasting ‘his substance with riotous living... with harlots’ (Luke 15: 13 and 15: 30).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beuckelaer specialised in scenes like this, full of abundant and varied produce. This painting develops two themes: that of his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Market Squares</span>, made between 1561 and 1566; and that of his many pictures of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Poultry Sellers</span>, made between 1563 and 1569. His <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Two Women and a Man Selling Poultry</span> dated 1564 (Palazzo Bianco, Genoa) is particularly close to our painting. Beuckelaer often signed his paintings in half-hidden places: here his signature and the date, 1570, are on the barrel below the brass jug.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">None of the produce shown here is especially exotic – this is the kind of food that was readily available in the Netherlands in the sixteenth century, at least in normal times. Still, the food is very much the star of the show and was largely a way for Beuckelaer to show off his astonishing ability to convey texture, in the contrast between the gleaming brass and earthenware pots, the shimmering fabrics and the feathers and fur of the birds and animals.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This large and well-stocked kitchen is a hive of industry. Four female servants prepare and cook food while a young man perches on a stool before the fire, swigging from an earthenware jug. Pots and pans litter the brick floor and every available surface seems stacked with produce.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is clearly a wealthy household – the kitchen fills the whole floor of a country house. Sun pours in through the open shutters of the window on the left, falling on a jug and a basket of rolls and cheeses on a narrow table. On the right, a door opens to outside stairs and trees behind. There’s a grand stone fireplace, pewter plates and flagons, plus a range of earthenware, pewter vessels and green glasses on the sideboard. A second spacious room, decorated in a fashionable antique style, is visible through the doorway beside the fire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There’s also an abundance of produce: a ham hangs from a beam and a haunch of mutton, a turkey and an exotically coloured hen from the wooden dresser; mussels shells are scattered on the floor; partridges, drakes and woodcocks lie on the table. Another haunch of mutton lies on a green-glazed earthenware dish in the foreground. The two women at the front pluck and prepare fowls to be roasted on the spit one holds in her hand. The others tend the fire and the pot hanging over it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HRY-0001-0000-0000.htm">four large paintings</a> in which food symbolises the four elements – earth, air, fire and water. This one shows fire. Cooking a meal on a hot summer’s day has always been a warm job, and this picture seems to radiate heat: the doors and windows are flung open to let air in, the woman by the fire holds up her hand to shield her face from the blaze and the cheeks of the two women in the foreground glow. One turns to look out at us over her shoulder, as if we too are part of this busy scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a back room, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, dressed in a blue robe and with a halo of whitish light around his head, speaks to Martha and Mary. Seated on his left is Mary, who ’sat at Jesus‘ feet and heard his word’. The standing woman gesturing indignantly is Martha, who complained of her sister’s idleness: ‘Lord, doest Thou not care that my sister hath left me to serve alone? Bid her therefore that she help me’. But Christ answered, ‘Mary hath chosen that good part which shall not be taken away from her’ (Luke 10: 38–42). The artist included religious scenes in the background of many of his paintings, often connected to the subject of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beuckelaer often reused themes and details, and painted a number of kitchen scenes with Martha and Mary in the background: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ in the House of Martha and Mary</span> (there are versions in: Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium, Brussels, from 1565; Stockholm, 1565; Amsterdam, 1566; Lemgo, 1569; Vienna, 1574). The model for the girl looking out at us may also have been used in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H9Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Four Elements: Earth</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0H3V-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Four Elements: Water</a></span>. He often put his signature in half-hidden places: here it’s on the edge of the sideboard. The date, 1570, is on the lintel above the doorway.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A plethora of piscine produce is presented to us: fish of all kinds are piled in baskets, tumble over the edges of platters or slip from the stallholder’s grasp. On the far left is an earthenware dish of sprats and/or immature herrings; in front of the woman in the red hat is a large wooden platter containing three carp, two pike and two tench. She rests her arm on a tub of plaice. In front of the man is a basket of large cod and in the lower right corner an eviscerated ray lies on an earthenware platter. Other dishes contain herrings, silver bream, a rudd and perch. There are even mussel shells scattered on the floor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two vendors, who ignore their clients and look directly at us, seem to be selling different kinds of fish. The woman specialises in freshwater fish, the man – who has obviously been chopping up produce with the large knife resting on the block behind his arm – in sea fish. The five women behind are customers. Some are servants: one balances a tray of cheese wrapped in white clothes on her head, another a brass(?) vessel. Two, evidently of higher rank, wear black mantles.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although it looks like a contemporary scene – the people are dressed in sixteenth-century clothes, and on the left they walk up and down a street lined with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> buildings, including the Rode Poort, or Red Gate, of Antwerp – something else is going on too. Through the arch in the middle you can see a ship with fishermen hauling in their nets. One man wades through the water towards a figure on the shore. The water is the Sea of Galilee and this is the miraculous draught of fishes (John 21: 1 – 14). <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, risen from the dead, appeared to his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostles</a>, who had had an unsuccessful night’s fishing. He told them to cast their nets on the other side of the boat and they pulled in a multitude of fish.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HRY-0001-0000-0000.htm">four large pictures</a> in which the four elements – earth, air, fire and water – are represented as food, with biblical scenes in the background. The artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0RSC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Joachim Beuckelaer</a>, specialised in market and kitchen scenes with elaborate displays of food. He has signed, monogrammed and dated the picture on the edge of the table on the left of the basket of cod: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Joahim buekeleer/15.IB.69</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beuckelaer often reused figures and settings, although rarely repeated them exactly. The ray recurs in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fish Market with the Miraculous Draught of Fishes</span>. Old women similar to the one on the left appear in other paintings, for example in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Market Square with the Calling of Matthew</span> (Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples), dated 1566. He perhaps used himself as a model for the male fish seller – this face reappears in several of his pictures. A similar view down the Rodestraat, which may well have been visible from his workshop, appears in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Couple selling Poultry</span> of 1569 (Museo Nazionale di Capodimonte, Naples).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beuckelaer’s ability as a painter is perhaps most apparent in this picture. He has painted very quickly, usually thinly and with remarkable economy. With surprising boldness he has laid in the paint with broad brushstrokes and was not nervous of extreme contrasts of tone. The three gutted herring in the top right corner would not look out of place in paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manet</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a>.</p></div>
