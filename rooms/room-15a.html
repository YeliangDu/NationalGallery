        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The languid brown eyes of a young man gaze out at us, his look faintly quizzical. But who is he? His long hair waves softly about his neck, the shadow of a moustache dusts his upper lip, a wisp of a curl brushes a wide brow, and his full mouth pouts a little, adding to the uncertainty of his expression.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is a miniature, just over 16 by 12.2 cm. Its delicate oval shape is contained in a heavy, hexagonal Netherlandish frame, black stippled with red. In the days before photography, miniature portraits were made of wealthy people for families, friends or for diplomatic contacts. They were often copies of larger portraits, but sometimes there was just one made, as in this case. The pose – the torso turned to the side and the face looking back at the viewer – originates with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>, and was taken up by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P19-0001-0000-0000.htm">Coques</a> admired and aspired to emulate him, becoming known as ‘The Little Van Dyck’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are more aspects about the image itself that raise questions. Because of the ribbons fluttering around the arm facing us, made fashionable by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TPJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Louis XIV</a>, it is difficult to tell what that arm is doing. Does the young man have his hand on his hip, his elbow bent; is his arm hanging by his side? The blue fabric at his neck is a cravat string – with no cravat. To complement this jacket a flat, fan-shaped cravat would be the elegant choice, but it may be that this picture was painted when the cravat was falling out of fashion (and becoming a forerunner to the ties we know today).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Who was this person, rich and eminent enough to have had a likeness taken, yet whose name has been lost? It’s likely that we shall never know. There isn‘t enough of a trail to follow. What little there is ends in 1915, it appears.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When the portrait came to the National Gallery in 1910, it had a label on the back stating that the young man was Charles Mordaunt, 3rd Earl of Monmouth. By the time a new catalogue was published in 1915, this attribution had been discounted. He was dubbed with the title ’Unknown‘, and there he stays. The portrait is neither signed nor dated, but the style and brushwork are Coques’s. The date – about 1670 – can be estimated by the man’s glamorous, white satin jacket. This fashion came a year or two earlier and stayed popular for a long time – so it might be later than 1670 but it can’t be much before.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Was he English? There must have been some reason for the original attribution, long since lost. Coques worked mainly in Antwerp though was employed by several of the European courts. The young man might have come across him on the Grand Tour – an educational tour of the continent for young aristocrats – or it’s thought that Coques may have been in England around 1640, and might have made useful contacts then.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A finely dressed young woman gazes assuredly out at the viewer. The distinct shape of her nose, the turn of her mouth and her faintly dimpled chin reveal that this is a portrait, though the sitter’s identity is unknown. She is shown in the guise of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Agnes</a>, patron saint of young girls and virgins, with her attributes of a lamb (a symbol of her chaste innocence and her Christian devotion) and a sword (the instrument of her martyrdom).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Agnes was a beautiful young girl from a wealthy Roman family. They were early Christians, and Agnes was sentenced to death after spurning her suitors and pledging devotion to her faith. Her condemners tried to burn her at the stake; when this failed to kill her, she was stabbed or beheaded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saintly guise may have been chosen because the sitter and saint shared a name, or it may simply be that the artist, sitter or patron wished the sitter to be associated with Saint Agnes’s qualities of youth, beauty, piety, steadfastness and chastity. This didn't necessarily mean the subject of the portrait was unmarried; in fact, such characteristics might allude to the fact that she was about to be married, or that it was a commission by a proud husband of a virtuous wife. The silver support and the delicate finish certainly suggest that this was a precious object, perhaps painted for a loved one or spouse to carry with them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture holds another clue to the woman’s identity. The ornately decorated stone portico in the background resembles the one designed by the Flemish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a> to connect the two wings of his house, the Rubenshuis, in Antwerp. If the building is the Rubenshuis, the picture must predate a 1684 print of the property that includes additions not featured here. The dating of the architecture and the sitter’s fashionable contemporary dress of about 1680 suggest that she may be a member of the Hillewerve family, who lived in the property at this time. No record of an ‘Agnes’ has yet been found, however.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P19-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gonzales Coques</a> was born and worked in Antwerp. He trained with Pieter Bruegel the Younger and David Rijckaert, and became a portrait and figure painter, patronised by both the Spanish Regents of the Southern Netherlands and the House of Orange, the rulers of the Northern Netherlands.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the best examples of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a>’s brilliance at depicting different surfaces and textures in an extraordinarily convincing way: the fraying cloth crumpled underneath the bucket, the smooth stone of the sill, the feathers in the duck’s wing and the pocked skin of its breast and neck.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Not only do they look almost photographically real in themselves, but Dou has demonstrated his mastery of reflection and distortion by mirroring them in the shiny curve of the pail. Many seventeenth-century Dutch painters were skilled at painting in this way, but few – if any – could match Dou, who was apprenticed to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>, but also studied the minute techniques of copper engraving and glass painting. He became one of the most successful artists in Leiden, and his accounts of everyday scenes like this – a young woman buying poultry and game – were particularly sought-after.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As here, many were set in an architectural frame. It is an unusual device: while the details and the interaction between the figures are extremely realistic, the architecture reminds us that this is not a real scene. A typical Leiden poultry seller might well have looked as we see her here, but she definitely wouldn't have displayed her produce in such a grand and formal setting. It was a device which proved popular with Dou’s own customers though, and it also allowed him to give a greater sense of depth to the painting. The caged chicken, the crumpled cloth and the dead birds protruding over the sill, and the poulterer reaching out with the hare all seem to come forward into our own space. The illusion is intensified by the dramatic shaft of light which highlights the objects and figures in the foreground. Meanwhile, the shop and the two figures inside recede into a deep, shadowy background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is quite a formulaic composition. Dou’s customers might have recognised the sculpted panel showing children playing with a goat. It is based on a seventeenth-century marble bas-relief and often appears in Dou’s work from 1651 and later. The old woman is also recognisable from several of his works from at least 1647 onwards. The style of this painting, however, suggests that it was made significantly later than this: there are comparisons, for example, with his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grocer’s Shop</span> of 1672 (Royal Collection, London).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some art historians – swayed by what they see as the exaggerated eagerness of the young woman – have argued that we should read a moral message into the scene, based on the fact that the Dutch word for bird (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">vogel</span>) puns with a slang word for sex (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">vogelen</span>), and that empty bird cages could symbolise the loss of chastity. Hares were also associated with lust. But it’s hard to make a convincing case for what such a message or lesson might be. It is more likely that if Dou were suggesting any double entendres, they were for comic, rather than moral, effect.</p></div>

But the realism belies the point of the painting. Until recently it was thought to be a self portrait, but the similarities with known paintings of Dou are too generic for us to be sure. It is more likely that this is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span> – an image of a stock character – which were highly popular in the Netherlands at the time.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the great achievements of the best Dutch artists of the seventeenth century was their ability to capture a moment in time. Whether the image is of a woman sweeping a kitchen, a group of men in conversation around a meeting table, or a riotous scene in a tavern, you get the sense that you are sharing a real moment with them. Rather than a deadpan composition, the painting is somehow alive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This tiny portrait is an example of just this effect. The young man has turned towards us and settled his elbow over the back of his chair. He seems to be waiting for us to say something. His pipe is paused, slightly away from his mouth, and he meets our gaze with an easy, relaxed look. Perhaps he has just taken a puff: the tobacco is glowing and a wisp of smoke twists upwards from the bowl.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Maybe it is this sense of a pause in his pipe smoking which creates the feeling of a moment captured – it is always hard to explain why some paintings are more effective than others in this respect. The exquisite detail definitely adds to the atmosphere. Even though this portrait is just 19 x 15cm, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dou</a> has teased out the pattern and the highlights of the gold braid on his hat, the reflections in his eyes and even the texture of the skin on his left hand. But he also adds the occasional dash of brilliance. The glimpse of his shirt where his jerkin has become unbuttoned has been suggested with a single stroke of white paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dou’s father was a glass engraver, so perhaps his attention to minutiae was inherited or ingrained at an early age. His creativity with oil paint, however, was learned in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>’s studio, where he was an apprentice from 1628 until 1631/2.  He certainly made a success of his abilities and founded the so-called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fijnschilders</span> (‘fine, or small-scale, meticulous’) group of painters in his home town of Leiden, where he specialised in minutely painted scenes of everyday life. Such was his fame by the 1660s that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0U15-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles II</a> invited him to visit London. He declined, preferring to stay in his home town.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Until recently this picture – which was probably painted in about 1635–40 when Dou was in his mid-twenties – was considered to be a self portrait. The pipe perhaps replaced the brush which Dou saw when he looked in the mirror. The long wavy hair, the moustache and tuft below his lip, and the hump in the nose have similarities with portraits that we know are of Dou. But they are too generic for us to be sure of a secure identification and it is more likely that what we are looking at here is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span> – an image of a stock character – which were highly popular in the Netherlands at the time.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting has in the past been described as a portrait of the painter’s wife, but we now know Gerrit Dou never married. Perhaps it was something about the intimacy and sensitivity of this tiny image which led people to assume that there was a relationship between the artist and the sitter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It does appear to be a portrait of a real person rather than an example of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span> (a genre depicting personality types which was particularly popular at the time). Dou’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CPA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Young Man</a></span>, a painting of very similar size, is probably a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronie</span> rather than a straight portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If the painting here is indeed a portrait, we will probably never know the name of the subject. But we can tell that she comes from a rather well-off family. She is wearing teardrop pearl earrings as well as a pearl necklace – jewellery which was fashionable, coveted and expensive at the time. Otherwise she is dressed informally in an open-necked blouse, and a fur-trimmed jacket which, though a sign of wealth, was commonly worn by women in the home. The black gauze veil covering her hair is a sign of Christian piety.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">That the portrait has been commissioned from Dou suggests that the sitter, or her family, appreciated high-quality painting, or wanted to be associated with one of the most fashionable painters of the time – note the prominence of his signature against the background on the left. Dou was one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>’s most successful apprentices, but he stayed in their hometown of Leiden after Rembrandt had left to set up his studio in Amsterdam. Dou, whose father was a glass engraver, went on to specialise in minutely painted scenes of everyday life, and also a small number of tiny portraits such as this. He was the founder of the so-called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fijnschilders</span> (painters of fine, or small-scale, meticulous works). Such was his fame by the 1660s that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0U15-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles II</a> invited him to visit London. He declined, preferring to stay in his hometown.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">You can see why his skill was so admired. Dou’s depiction of the fall of light here is remarkably successful given the small scale on which he was working. Look at the sheen on the pearls, the complex shadows on the sitter’s blouse and the faintest hint of moisture on her lower lip.  Pentimenti (alterations made by the artist to an area already painted) in the neck of the chemise suggest that he went to some trouble to get this very small detail right. There’s some uncertainty about when exactly this picture was made, but on grounds of style and costume it is most likely to have been painted about 1655. </p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young woman sits, one delicate hand outstretched and holding an almond to feed to a parrot. On one finger she has a thimble and on her knee is a piece of cloth and a needle pillow. She has stopped sewing to feed the bird that hunches over, assessing her gift. It’s an African Grey. Its feathers glisten, its beady eye suddenly caught by the nut.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young woman is dressed in sumptuous clothes – a heavy, cream, satin skirt with a rose-pink velvet jacket edged with white fur. The skirt of the jacket fans out round her in deep folds, showing off the expensive trimming. Her fair hair is fashionably dressed, caught back with ribbon bows. Tendrils of hair tickle her forehead and rosy cheeks, and longer strands hang down to curl round her neck. She smiles slightly, with a distant look in her eyes as if her thoughts are elsewhere.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Mieris places the young woman in front of  a bed, with an open door hung with a climbing plant to the left. They are barely visible now, but if more distinct, they would make an openly intimate setting for this tender portrait. Perhaps, though, the extremely dark background does more to set off the soft colours and subtle lighting than a more cluttered background would do, leaving the young woman more alone with her thoughts.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In some Dutch paintings of this period the parrot had erotic connotations, but probably not in this picture. The bird is also sometimes seen as a symbol of ‘eagerness to learn’ since parrots can be taught to speak human words and phrases. In a contemporary illustration in a book of advice on marriage, a woman representing ‘eagerness to learn’ is shown with an embroidery frame in one hand and a parrot perched on the other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Mieris was one of the most successful genre and portrait painters in the Dutch Republic at the time. He was celebrated as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fijnschilder</span>, one of the Leiden ’school of fine painting', his technique learnt from his teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a>. This tiny, exquisite painting was one of the most successful that van Mieris ever produced. He made three versions of it himself and it was copied many times by others. The painting is on copper, which makes his brushstrokes virtually invisible and allows him to achieve subtlety and realism in his portrayal of textures, from the bird’s stiff feathers to the detail of the braid on the back of the young woman’s chair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The model used for the young woman is thought to be Cunera van de Cock, who married Frans van Mieris in 1657.

About 120 of his pictures still exist, and although Cunera appears in about a quarter of them, very few are actual portraits of her. The rest are genre pictures or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tronies</span> (character studies) in which she is playing a role.

She was about 27 years old and had already given birth to their first son, Willem, when it was painted. Seen in profile with her head turned back slightly towards us, she gazes into the distance, her expression perhaps a little wistful. She wears a long, white coif and her clothes appear unassuming and plain. But the jacket into which her white shift is tucked is expensive, made of dark red velvet and white fur, and the hem of the coif is embroidered with fine gold thread. There’s just enough restrained but costly decoration to suggest that the family is prosperous; van Mieris was already becoming one of the most successful artists in Leiden, the town in which they lived.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cunera hides her hair, immaculately combed back under the white coif to reveal her high forehead and arched eyebrows. Van Mieris portrays her as the perfect, modest wife. With almost invisible brushstrokes, he makes her skin glow, soft and almost tangible. He allows one fine tendril of hair to escape the coif to wave down in the shadow on her cheek, and shows the fur reaching up her jacket to rest on her breast.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was originally oval in shape and thought to be painted on vellum (made from calfskin and unusual as a picture support at this time). At some point around the end of the eighteenth century, it was put onto an oak panel to become the small rectangle that exists now. At the same time, an artist less skilled than van Mieris painted over the background. Presumably it was this same artist that lengthened the sleeve and the fur cuff, making the sleeve three-quarter length, a fashion that came in some years after the portrait was painted. Again, the brushstrokes are far less accomplished than van Mieris’s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Celebrating a wedding or other important event with a pair of portraits was traditional in the seventeenth century. There is a self portrait of van Mieris that is thought to be a pair with this picture (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), perhaps painted to celebrate Willem’s birth. It’s also an oval and probably on vellum with no later additions. A pupil of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a>, who called him ‘Prince of my Pupils', van Mieris belonged to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fijnschilders</span> – fine painters famous for their flawless finish and precise attention to detail – in his native Leiden.</p></div>

By this time, he was a highly successful artist in his home city of Leiden. His work was bought, sometimes for vast sums, by the wealthy of the city but also by nobility from abroad, including the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, the ruling family of Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps for this reason, van Mieris chose to show himself in the Italian version of the costume of one of the characters from the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">commedia dell'arte</span> that originated in Italy. This was, and still is, a rumbustious form of physical theatre, in which the actors sing, mime, dance, play music, tell bawdy jokes, perform acrobatic feats and rough and often rude knock about. Originally played in the streets, by the seventeenth century it had evolved in two ways: one form continued as popular street theatre, the other became a more sophisticated version performed in private venues. In van Mieris’s Dutch Republic, this would have been a Chamber of Rhetoric – precursors of theatres – where plays of all kinds were put on and poetry recited. Comedies were the preferred form of drama and judging by van Mieris’s expression in the picture, one he would have enjoyed too.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Mieris may or may not have acted in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">commedia</span> himself, but his gorgeous costume in this painting would perhaps align him with the more refined version. His painting technique was certainly refined, so meticulous that brushmarks in his pictures are almost universally invisible. The assured painting of the elegant velvet cloak gleaming in the light contrasts with the delicate handling of the lace collar and with the white fabric and brocade ribbons of his huge puffball sleeves. The costume and his nonchalant pose, leaning on a balustrade looking back at us to invite us to share his fun, appear to be that of Ottavio, one of the lovers in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">commedia</span>. Van Mieris plays the cittern – a stringed instrument from medieval times – though the character is more often shown playing a flute or a guitar. Ottavio would have used these to serenade the woman he loved.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ottavio’s feathered hat is precariously balanced on the balustrade, adding to the whimsical, informal nature of the picture. Next to it is a glass, sparkling in the light, delicate and fragile, painted with great skill, and half full – for van Mieris, a wine glass would never have been half empty. There are several accounts of his heavy drinking, and in spite of the huge amounts he earned in his lifetime, he left very little when he died. He had no problem with showing his face ageing, the cheeks becoming slack and, in other portraits, red nosed and flushed. Popular and gregarious, he painted himself in many guises: in Turkish costume, as a cavalier, in a velvet hat with a twirly handlebar moustache and, most tellingly, as a jolly drunkard – mostly smiling and always with laughing eyes, inviting us to share his appetite for life.</p></div>

They aimed to show each object, each texture so authentically that they would seem tangible.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A kitchen setting provided van Mieris with the opportunity to show off his skills in representing as many different textures as possible. The plump hand of the young woman rests on the plump, feathered breast of one of the ducks on the stone windowsill. Her smooth skin contrasts with the grizzled flesh of the old man who has come to sell her a fish. He handles its silvery scales, lifting it from the wicker basket he holds; another is fixed on his back with leather straps.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two more wicker baskets appear, quite different but both portrayed with infinite precision, one holding turnips and the other snipe (small wading birds with long beaks). The two enormous cabbages nestling at the end of the windowsill look heavy, but the leaves have delicate frilled edges echoed in the lace decorating the woman’s shift and cap. Above the cabbages are more feathers – the soft, downy plumage of the pheasant’s breast and the long, stiff pinion feathers of its wings – and, close by, the fur of two dead rabbits, contrasting with the very live cat sniffing for food. A heavy woven curtain is drawn back to reveal the interior of the kitchen. A pewter pot stands on the table and ceramic dishes on wooden shelves. In the centre of the ceiling, joints of meat are impaled on gleaming metal hooks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But this hyperreality isn’t reality at all. This isn’t what a kitchen in the seventeenth-century Netherlands would have looked like – so many objects laid out in such a state of perfection. Van Mieris shows us the scene through a stone window with an arch, a carving of a classical scene beneath it, reminiscent of a niche in a grand building or church. This elevates the status of the kitchen and also, more importantly, of this picture and the artist’s skill in painting it. The carving shows the story of Galatea, a Greek nymph who escaped over the sea from the clutches of the one-eyed giant, Cyclops. Van Mieris seems to contrast the grotesque stone fish Galatea clutches with the weighty, slippery one on the earthenware dish on the sill, and the hard chill of the stone frieze with the soft, warm fur of the cat strategically placed in front of it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Mieris made a successful career from the portrayal of the interiors of kitchens or shops, using the device of an arched window with a classical frieze below and a profusion of objects to elevate their status. He took the idea of the ‘niche picture’ from his father and teacher Frans, who had himself followed the example of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a> (look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CXF-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Poulterer’s Shop</a></span>).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A velvet curtain is drawn back from a stone window to reveal a little boy, who gazes upwards at a bubble floating past him and into the darkness. His eyes are wide and his long, fair curls frame his chubby cheeks. He leans on the sill to steady himself, and his other hand holds his hat – perhaps hoping to reach up and let the bubble come to rest on it. His concentration is total and focused on the fragile bubble.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The boy is dressed in the ornate fashion of the 1670s: rich fabrics – lace and satin – and deep gold bows and ribbons at neck and elbow. White and gold ostrich feathers adorn his hat. On the shelf by his hand are shells and a silver tazza, all costly objects of great interest to collectors and highly prized. An almost identical tazza can be seen today in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the shadows behind, a smaller child concentrates equally fiercely. Using a long pipe, he blows bubbles in the soapy liquid held in a cockle shell. Already a tiny iridescent sphere is forming. Pictures of this kind were popular in the Netherlands in the seventeenth century, bought for their charm, probably for a nostalgia for childhood and for an artist’s skill in the depiction of rich fabrics, transparent bubbles and the children’s faces, hair and expressive eyes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But these paintings are known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">homo bulla</span> (‘man is a bubble’). Because bubbles burst so quickly, they are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegories</a> intended to suggest the brevity of life. The silver tazza we see here may carry a message too – that gathering earthly possessions is a futile act in the face of mortality. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caspar Netscher</a> painted several of these pictures; one portrays a lone boy seen through a stone window (now in the Mauritshuis, The Hague). He’s similarly dressed and looks up at a bubble he has blown himself; the tube he has used points up in its direction. By his side is a small rose, often used by painters as another symbol of how short life is, its petals already falling.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This tradition of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">homo bulla</span> reaches back into medieval times when the children were portrayed nude and with wings, as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a>. The Dutch, although embracing the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">homo bulla</span> as a life warning, seem to have preferred their children more realistic and fully clad, often very fashionably dressed. The theme was still popular in the eighteenth century, perhaps most famously in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Soap Bubbles</span> by Jean Siméon-Chardin (National Gallery of Art, Washington).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A man offers gold coins and jewellery to woman lying on a bed – a carving of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> on the bedpost in the foreground removes any doubt that it is an amorous encounter. The glass of wine would also have been associated with licentious behaviour, especially in the hand of a woman. Whether this is a transaction taking place in a brothel or a gift from an enamoured lover is not explicit, but the coins strongly imply that it’s a commercial exchange.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As is often the case in Dutch paintings of this nature, the composition suggests that even though it is the man who is paying, it’s the woman who is in control and who knows how to exploit the weakness of men. He adopts the pose of a supplicant, his hands full of an offering of gold coins and jewellery, and looks up adoringly into her eyes, a dreamy, slack-jawed expression on his face. She looks down on him with a knowing gaze as she reaches for her payment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lighting also makes it clear that the woman is the centre of attention. She is bathed in the flattering glow of the candle, which also emphasises the softness of the pillow behind her. By creating a mood of warm intimacy, the candlelight softens the transactional nature of the scene. Perhaps too, the candle echoes the state of mind of the woman’s customer. The heat from the flame has softened the wax so that it has started to buckle, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PV9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schalcken</a> has accentuated this sense of malleability with the curving shape of the flame and the brass candle holder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But while the light may create an indulgent and forgiving atmosphere, it also highlights some hard, worldly realities: the gold glittering in the man’s hand, the costly gold braid on the woman’s dress, the pearls of her necklace – an expensive piece of jewellery – and the gleam of the wine glass. These are worldly rewards of indulging the softness and warmth of the flesh. Schalcken’s customers certainly would not have approved of prostitution or the rewards implied here, but given the popularity of paintings which explored the tensions between illicit pleasure and moral integrity, many were fascinated by the subject. The National Gallery has another painting by Schalcken, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Allegory of Virtue and Riches</a></span>, which explores the theme in a rather different way.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Schalcken was taught by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a> and he specialised in small highly finished paintings like this, which is only about half the size of a piece of A4 paper. He often painted candlelit scenes, with the flame used as a prominent feature in the foreground.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A small, beady-eyed sparrow on one side of a set of scales heavily outweighs the gold and pearls which a weeping woman, two tears glistening on her cheeks, places in the other. Clearly, in the real word, this couldn't happen: the bird would be much the lighter than the jewellery. But this picture does not seek to depict the real world – it’s an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> painting, and the artist invites us to decode the message behind the central image of the impossible scales.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Nearly 400 years after the painting was made we can never be sure of the accuracy of our interpretations, but it almost certainly implies that no matter how much gold and how many pearls the woman loads onto the scales, their value can never match that of the sparrow. A bird could be symbolic of many things, but here it mostly likely represents virtue and true love – qualities which may also be reflected by the image of the two embracing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a> carved into the stone next to it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Why, then, is the woman weeping? And why too is there an image of another putto – or perhaps <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> – in the niche behind her? The position of his arms and declining head closely match hers, and he too appears anguished. As well as the jewels, her expensive clothes and the costly ostrich feather in her hair suggest a wealthy lifestyle, and the implication is that this has been gained through prostitution. It is a trade-off she now regrets.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting also has jewel-like qualities. It is slightly smaller than a paperback novel and is painted on a copper plate, which allowed the artist to create an exceptionally fine, bright finish. This style of highly meticulous small-scale painting was a speciality of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PV9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schalcken</a>, which he learned from his teacher, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a>, in Leiden. Another painting of very similar size (now in the Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam) by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Frans van Mieris the Elder</a>, who was also taught by Dou, shows a woman releasing a sparrow from a box. It is an allegory of the loss of virginity and was once in the same collection as Schalcken’s. It is possible that Schalcken’s picture was intended as a companion painting to represent the woman’s grief at her loss.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two seventeenth-century Dutch paintings with this distinctly unglamorous title in the National Gallery’s collection. The other, attributed to Pieter van den Bosch, was painted about ten years before this one, and is a much more naturalistic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZO-0001-0000-0000.htm">scene of a woman at work in a kitchen</a>. It evokes a sense of the calm, order and simplicity of everyday routine and of the virtue of labour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These themes are also present in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PV9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schalcken</a>’s painting. The old woman is quietly absorbed in polishing the glowing brass of a large pan. Its inside catches the light, illuminating her arms and face; other objects on the sill also gleam in the daylight. It is these which give the scouring a different, darker significance and clearly identify the picture as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vanitas</span> (‘vanity’, symbolising the transience of life).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The broken pot, right in the centre, looks rather odd to our eye, but Schalcken’s customers would have understood a clear suggestion of fragility and vulnerability to the ravages of time. The candlestick, tipped on its side, suggests the same. Candles, which burn for a limited time before they are blown out or gutter and die, were a common analogy for mortality. The butterfly, which has apparently settled innocently on the stone at the side of the painting, is another subtle signifier: they were known to enjoy the briefest of lives. All this casts the woman’s work into another light. It might still be considered virtuous but it is also, ultimately, futile.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Today, we might find it hard to understand the appeal of hanging a reminder of our mortality up on the living room wall. But at the time it was quite normal. Plenty of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">vanitas</span> paintings were much more explicit than this one, even including a skull to drive the point home. The moral of these paintings was not a negative one. It was an attempt to contrast the transience of worldly life with the everlasting nature of faith and Christian redemption. And they could also been seen as a reminder to make the most of our life, before it is taken from us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such paintings were also a chance for artists to demonstrate their ability to depict objects, and people, with lifelike precision. Schalcken’s teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a>, was a master of this. Schalcken learned from him, and also borrowed the format of stone arch (or niche) to frame the old lady. Dou’s niche paintings, normally of tradespeople at work, were very popular in his native Leiden and the framing device was often <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEW-0001-0000-0000.htm">copied by other artists</a>. In this picture, Schalcken has simplified the composition. There is a particularly clear contrast between light and shade – the interior of the room is so dark that we can’t make out any of its details.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A boy sits in a dark room, but a glimmer of light through the window reveals his face and the dead mouse he holds in one hand. The other hand covers the mousetrap. This is not a portrait but an imaginary situation, intended as an entertainment and, possibly, a moral lesson.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The boy seems to be dressed in the fashion of the sixteenth century. A white shirt gleams at the open neck of a brocade doublet, yet the feather in his hat and the outsize bow holding back his long, black curls are more the style of the late 1670s, when the picture was painted. Far from celebrating ridding the household of a pest, the boy lifts his chin to gaze into the distance as if in a dream. His wistful expression would suggest that it’s not the triumph of catching the mouse he’s dreaming of, but something – or someone – nearer to his heart and yet far away. In the eighteenth century the painting still had a pendant, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Boy putting a Bird in a Cage</span>, which is now lost. It has been suggested that the two pictures formed a related pair whose subject is moderation in love.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In classical literature, the image of a mouse and mousetrap was used to symbolise the punishment of overindulgence; poets of the seventeenth century carried on the tradition, particularly in matters of love. One of them, Jacob Cats, also wrote popular emblem books on morals and correct behaviour, so such imagery would have been widely understood – if you are trapped by love, you are unaware of the world around you and lost in dreams. The correct place for love was thought to be in marriage. The birdcage in the lost picture might have been interpreted in two ways, possibly depending on whether the bird was shown singing or not. Being a captive to love can be a pleasure, but can also prevent you from engaging with the world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know who, if anyone, commissioned the picture, it was painted quite early in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen van der Werff’s</a> career. Later, when he had found success, he became court painter to the Elector Palatine Johann Wilhelm in Düsseldorf, and was created a knight in 1703.</p></div>
