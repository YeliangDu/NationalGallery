        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gerrit Berckheyde has placed us among the citizens and the most important buildings of his native Haarlem, and a visitor to the market square today would find a view similar to the one in this painting of 1674. The Grote Kerk (Great Church), which is dedicated to Saint Bavo, dominates the composition and is bathed in strong sunlight. To the right of the square, the town’s meat market with its decorated stepped gable stands out among the neighbouring buildings. As a butcher’s son, Berckheyde would have been quite familiar with this mercantile institution. The colonnaded portico of Haarlem’s town hall takes up the right side of the townscape, and Berckheyde placed his signature on the base of the corner column.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting emphasises Haarlem’s religious, political and commercial functions, and the city’s inhabitants gathered on the square literally live their lives between these institutions, adding a layer of subtle symbolism.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If you were to visit the market square of Haarlem today, you would find a view that is not much different to the one in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PYR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Berckheyde</a>’s 1674 painting. We are about to step onto a marketplace where a crowd of townspeople are going about their day-to-day business. A lavishly dressed couple walking their dog on the left side of the painting stand out.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the right is a colonnaded structure with a balustrade, identified as part of the city’s town hall. It casts a prominent shadow in the foreground of the painting, and forms an ideal vantage point for the towering church beyond. The stepped gables of the smaller brick buildings that surround the square are typical of seventeenth-century Dutch architecture. The tallest gable on the square’s shadowy side belongs to the meat market, a mercantile centre that still exists today, celebrated as one of the Netherlands’ most important late Renaissance buildings. Being the son of a butcher, the artist might have had a personal attachment to this place. The stalls surrounding the church belong to the town’s fish market, and are no longer there.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gerrit was one of the leading townscape painters of his time, together with his older brother Job. Like their more famous contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob van Ruisdael</a>, the brothers loved painting their native Haarlem. This picture is one of many that depicts the town’s Grote Kerk, a late Gothic church dedicated to Saint Bavo (a seventh-century saint from nearby Brabant, venerated as Haarlem’s patron saint). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Market Place and Town Hall, Haarlem</span>, another picture by Berckheyde, is on long-term loan to the National Gallery from the Victoria and Albert Museum – it shows the marketplace from the other side, looking from the church towards the town hall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Taken together, this picture’s three prominent buildings – church, town hall and meat market – represent the city’s religious, political and commercial functions. The people gathered on the square literally live their lives between these institutions, adding some subtle symbolism: this townscape is testament to civic pride.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gerrit signed and dated the picture on the corner column of the town hall portico, ‘Gerrit Berck Heyde/1674’, inscribing himself on his native city. You can imagine the man attentively reading the announcement card on that same column next discovering the painter’s signature.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is something rather mysterious about this rare – and tiny – landscape by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4R-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van der Heyden</a>, who specialised in painting urban scenes in a highly precise and realistic way. In this picture he has, instead, thrown a sort of veil over the buildings, a screen of trees which obscures our view. Instead of the detailed brickwork he usually delighted in articulating, he gives us only a hazy impression of the walls and roof of the building. We can’t even be sure which of the dark shapes on the ground floor is a window and which is a door.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The title, which would have been given to the painting long after it was painted, describes the building as a farm. But given the water in the foreground it’s also possible that this is a mill house. Perhaps we are looking at the pool which feeds the race and drives a wheel on the far side. We can’t be sure. The only hint of what lies beyond is the end of a punt moored to the bank at the extreme right of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sense of mystery is also enhanced by the lighting effects. Van der Heyden suggests a day of bright sunny spells. Grey clouds loom, but there is plenty of blue in the sky and the tops of the trees seem to be caught by sunshine, especially on the left-hand side of the picture. There is warmth in the air, too: the cowherd on the river bank is either wearing shorts, or has rolled up his trousers. He’s happy to leave one leg dangling in the water while he washes the other foot. Next to him, a thirsty sheep cranes its head to drink.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite this, there is deep shade in the foreground, muting the colours into an earthy assemblage of greens and brown. We struggle to make out the details of the figure on the bank and the scattering of sheep and cows in the gloom of the underwood. The slightly ruffled waters of the pool reflect back only the sombre shadows of the trees and buildings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The combination of water in the foreground, with a dark wood backlit by a brighter sky beyond is reminiscent of another painting in our collection, made about 45 years earlier: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GJ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Landscape with a River by a Wood</a></span> by Cornelis Vroom. It is unlikely that van der Heyden would have seen it, but it was one of the first examples of the tradition in which he was working.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a tiny and deceptively simple painting of the view of the south-east garden front of the Huis ten Bosch (‘House in the Wood’), which was built just outside The Hague as a summer palace for Amalia van Solms. She was married to Prince Frederik Hendrik of Orange, the head of state of the Netherlands from 1625 to 1647 – the period when it was becoming a global superpower, with a formidable navy, huge merchant fleet and a worldwide network of trade and political influence.  </p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see the building in its original state, a decade or so after it was finished. Today it is used by the Dutch royal family as an official residence, though it has been substantially altered and extended, and the statues and lattice-work obelisks are no longer in the garden.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4R-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van der Heyden</a> was famous for his exquisitely detailed paintings of buildings and street scenes which depicted, as one contemporary put it, ‘every little stone in the buildings so minutely that one could clearly see the mortar in the grooves in the foreground as well as the background’. That isn’t quite the case here: the canvas is too small to render such detail, though some of the mortar lines are visible in the brickwork of the house. But he painted at least six other views of the house and estate, including another from the same angle (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) which is almost exactly twice the size of the painting we see here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We can use the larger picture to make sense of some the details of the smaller, such as the intricate scrolling patterns of the French-style box hedges in the formal flowerbeds, known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">parterre de broderie</span>. We can also see that the low white flat-topped stands which line the avenues between the statues, empty in our picture, were used to display terracotta pots.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While the scale reduces the scope for precision, van der Heyden has created a remarkably powerful illusion of depth in a highly compressed space: dark green horizontals are crossed by white pot stands, statues and obelisks, and combined with figures of diminishing size. These straight lines are countered by the strong curves of the topiary hedge in the foreground, which are reflected by the trees to the side of the house. And if you look closely at the hedge you can see how carefully van der Heyden has picked out the detail: the sheen of the sunshine on the top surface, the lighter green of the new shoots and the orange patches of old clippings which have died but remain stuck.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As often in van der Heyden’s paintings, there are more people present than at first appears. We’ve counted 11 here; if you can’t find them all, look between the two statues on the right hand side. They represent both the garden workers and the leisured classes who benefitted from their labour.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the ultimate seventeenth-century examples of what today we might think of as a high-resolution image. No matter how closely you look at, or zoom in on, the details, they never quite pixelate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s a painting which has clearly been designed to look as realistic as possible. The surface is so finely worked that there is no trace of the painter’s brushstrokes. The shape of individual cobblestones has been carefully articulated; some of the lettering on the advertising bills pasted on the wooden bollards is legible; and the subtle distortions of the light shimmering on the surface of the canal are depicted with extraordinary care. Yet the artist has made a very strange mistake.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If you look carefully at the figures you will see that though most apparently have shadows, they do not have reflections. Take the two little girls, and the dog peeing against the post, for example. We can clearly see the image of the post reflecting back from the surface of the canal, but not the dog or the girls. The same is true of the woman in the doorway on the right: the reflection of the doorway is clear, but the woman is not there.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">How can we resolve this conundrum? We know that normally in scenes of this kind, the figures were added after the rest of the composition was complete. So it looks as though whoever was responsible for painting in the figures – it may have been a fellow artist or studio assistant, but most likely it was van der Heyden himself – simply forgot to make the adjustment. It is a surprising omission for a painter who was so obsessed with detail, in what was a major commission: this is one of his largest surviving paintings. It seems very unlikely that it was left unfinished because it was delivered to his clients, the  governors of the Westerkerk in Amsterdam – the church in the middle of the painting. It hung in their meeting room for more than 200 years.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So the missing reflections are an inexplicable mistake, but they do raise the question of how realistic these paintings were meant to be. The scene must certainly have looked approximately like the real one. Indeed, though the buildings around it have changed, the view of the church and the lines of the canal are very similar even today. Yet we can be sure that van der Heyden, who was a specialist in painting views of Dutch towns and cities such as this, would have manipulated some of the details to provide the most appealing view of the church for his clients. It is almost certainly no accident, for example, that there is a convenient gap in the tree line which allows us to see the eastern facade of the church more clearly, and that the tree which does stand in our way is a particularly skimpy one. By then screening most of the neighbouring buildings with foliage, van der Heyden has increased the visual emphasis on the church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">And looking very carefully through those leaves, we get another indication of his obsession with detail. It is clear that he painted every brick and window pane before he then painstakingly hid them again with thousands of tiny dabs of green paint.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is winter. One or two evergreens are visible, but the tree on the far side of the wall is leafless, as are the espaliered fruit trees growing up against the fence and the vine growing over the roof in the foreground. We seem to be looking at a scene just outside a kitchen – there is an outlet from a sink inside the house to the drain at the bottom of the wall on the right. A maid has brought a steaming cauldron out from the kitchen stove and placed it near the open drain in the courtyard. Apparently obeying her mistress, who stands in front of her, she seems to have taken the fish out of the cooking pot; perhaps she is doing this outside to make it easier to pour away the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of the most appealing aspects of Dutch seventeenth-century painting is the insight it gives us into everyday life, and especially the lives of women. Scenes of ordinary mothers and children or maids and their mistresses at ease in their own homes had hardly been depicted in art before. But in Holland from about the 1640s, the theme became a popular one.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter de Hooch</a>’s paintings are some of the most evocative examples of the genre. We see the women in his paintings working and playing – in gardens and courtyards, as here, and in their living rooms, kitchens and bedrooms. These scenes were not necessarily ‘real’; they were often idealised, perhaps offering examples of the sort of virtues required of women who were expected to administer a clean, harmonious household. But they were realistic. Rather than copy a room exactly, the artist might construct one out of familiar elements that seemed authentic to his or her contemporaries.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It seems that de Hooch composed this courtyard scene in just such a way. It was his usual practice. If you look at the far wall, there is a small pavilion or summer house – a portico with an open front supported by double columns. It is leaning against the brickwork, alongside the shed with the steeply sloping roof. The same summer house appears in two other paintings (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Family in a Courtyard in Delft</span> in the Academy of Fine Arts, Vienna; <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Woman and Child in a Courtyard</span> in the National Gallery of Art, Washington). The Washington painting has a water pump identical to the one here but in a different position. De Hooch also seems to have used the same broom and pail as models on another occasion; very similar examples feature in his most famous courtyard scene, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DGJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Courtyard of a House in Delft</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another distinctive characteristic of de Hooch’s paintings is the way in which he creates both a realistic sense of space and glimpses of the world beyond the picture. Here, the open door and window on the right hint at the kitchen that we can’t quite see, while two gates standing ajar create a long view down the garden path and through to some steps in the far distance.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the sunlight of a quiet afternoon this courtyard seems to radiate tranquillity. Everything is still, including the figures. It is a posed image but not a portrait, nor a quick snapshot of life in seventeenth-century Holland. It is more than that. It shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter de Hooch</a>’s skills in depicting architecture but it is also a portrayal of tender human relationships and a vision of women’s role in domesticity and the stability of the home.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is divided in two. On the left, painted with strong verticals and perspective, is the house and the passageway that leads through it. We see each mellow brick and stone of the arched doorway, already old when de Hooch was painting them, and below it, across the width of the picture, the intricate pattern of the courtyard tiles. On the right, framed by the strongly defined L-shape of the architecture, we see a tumbling vine on the fence, the chalky dust of the decaying wall and each rickety wooden plank of the log bin. The detail here is more freely painted than the bricks and tiles, with softer lines and colours taken from nature. The courtyard seems enclosed, though a number of openings seem to suggest otherwise. On the left, the bright red shutter hangs open, echoed on the right by the door at the top of the steps. The main door in the passageway is a link to the outside world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A discarded broom in the foreground catches the eye. Sometimes this can symbolise a room that needs a good sweeping, both physically and morally, but in this picture it takes on another symbolic meaning: a well-ordered household. Things may be old and well-used but they are still spotless. Most of all, broom and bucket nod to the presence of the young maid on the step behind. They are her tools. She has performed all her duties and stands, clean and calm, holding the hand of the little girl.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Yet there seems to be an air of ambiguity about the image. We don’t know what is through the doorway at the top of the steps, nor do we know what the little girl holds in her apron or what’s in the maid’s dish. Above the archway is a tablet rescued from a nunnery once on the site of the house. Literally translated it reads: ‘This is in Saint Jerome’s vale, if you wish to repair to patience and meekness. For we must first descend if we wish to be raised’, but its meaning is unclear. In keeping with the subtlety of the rest of the picture, de Hooch has obscured these words behind a delicate web of leaves. Perhaps the greatest enigma is the shadowy figure of the woman in the passageway. Even in silhouette, she appears to be more expensively dressed than the maid and is presumably the child’s mother, yet she has distanced herself from them and turns towards the houses opposite her own. As the woman of the house, she would be responsible for its care but also for how her house and family were presented to the world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There was a big change in household circumstances during the seventeenth century in Holland. For the first time, business was no longer done at home, with perhaps just one separate room near the front door for this activity. Men – and occasionally some women – now went out to offices or warehouses elsewhere in the city and the house became more and more the domain of women. Small treatises were written on household and family management. They were widely circulated and the most popular among them was Jacob Cats’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Houwelyck</span>, distinguished from others in that it was richly illustrated and written in verse. Most importantly, Cats addressed his book directly to women rather than men – the chapters are divided into Maiden, Sweetheart, Bride, Housewife, Mother and Widow.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These treatises presented an ideal vision of marriage and domesticity totally at variance with the reality of daily life, but it seems that some artists, including de Hooch, took up their themes and presented pictures that were a visual confirmation and encouragement of the ideals they put forward. Others chose to approach them with wit and irony, as Jan Steen does in his painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESK-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Effects of Intemperance</a></span>. The treatises also paid great attention to the bringing up of children, especially girls, and paintings like de Hooch’s were bought to reinforce that message. Again, Steen produced an image more open to interpretation in his painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Grace before Meat</a></span> – while the children appear well-behaved, the little girl’s eyes are fixed on the soup in a large tureen even while her hands are folded in prayer. But in the soft sunshine that warms the courtyard of de Hooch’s painting, the linked hands and the glance between maid and child suggest love and trust rather than strictness and convention.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">De Hooch was a master of the depiction of architecture, of perspective and of the detail of objects and textures, but he was also a master of the perceptive portrayal of human relationships, so subtly revealed in this painting. He has placed the child and maid in the area of the courtyard closest to nature, and their linked hands and the glance between them seem to be far more than merely an instructive homily. We are witness to a private, intimate moment between the two – a child who loves and is loved in return.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young couple, their eyes cast shyly downwards, seem about to strike up a duet. The woman, seated at the keyboard of a virginal, hands her partner a musical score, presumably the part for the violin on the table next to him. But his bow is nowhere to be seen and, in return for the score, he is offering her a glass of wine.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Scenes of music making among young people were common in Dutch seventeenth-century painting, and they would certainly have been understood as references to romantic love. Nearly 400 years later, it is much harder to know if and when we should also read more overtly sexual references into them. In some paintings, a wine glass held at the angle it is here clearly functions as a phallic symbol. But if there is an implication of that kind in this picture, it’s relatively subtle. The more obvious parallel set up by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Metsu</a> is between the wine glass proffered by the young man and one in the painting in the left background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Partly covered by a curtain – a traditional arrangement in Dutch houses at the time – we can make out just enough to identify it as a reference to an earlier work by Metsu himself (Alte Pinakothek, Munich). It depicts a kitchen or tavern scene on Twelfth Night (6 January), a celebration which commemorates the arrival of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> in Bethlehem but also marks the end of Christmas festivities. As such, it was a rowdy, drunken affair when people dressed up as kings, fools or other grotesque characters. Metsu’s earlier painting has a very similar figure to the one depicted in the painting behind the curtain. He is drinking and wearing a paper crown, though here, in the later copy, the composition has been reversed and the size of the figure increased.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The young man sitting by the virginal is drinking from a long wine glass which is very similar to the one held by the reveller in the background painting. So it may be that Metsu is making a link between a scene of apparent musical innocence and the potential that, fuelled by alcohol, it might lead to debauchery. The Latin inscriptions on the virginal would therefore seem to be a wry comment on the situation. Both taken from the Old Testament Book of Psalms, the one on the lid refers to the line, ‘In thee, O Lord, do I put my trust; never let me be put to confusion’, an implied warning against loss of virtue. The one below it, on the inside of the keyboard cover, is translated as, ‘Let every thing that hath breath praise the Lord’, thus advocating the importance of Christian worship. But as was so often the case in Dutch painting, the mood is not overtly judgemental. Sexual transgression seems to have been considered as a source of amusement as much as a subject for condemnation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The same virginal (with slight variations) with the same inscriptions occurs in other paintings by Metsu, for example <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lady at a Virginal</span> (Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam). He may have used a particular instrument as a model. The second inscription can be found on a virginal of 1620 (Musée Instrumental du Conservatoire, Brussels) which also has a very similar pattern on the front.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting – an evocation of light, space, soaring architecture and ordered elegance – shows the inside of the Buurkerk in Utrecht, from the door in the north side looking south-west. Several Dutch artists of the time specialised in painting church interiors, but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QFF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saenredam</a> was particularly innovative.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although he would often make adjustments to increase a picture’s impact, Saenredam’s paintings were underpinned by an accurate perspective, helping to create the sense of a convincingly real space. He was so successful at capturing the atmosphere and character of individual buildings that art historians often now describe him as the first ‘portraitist of architecture’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Recreating the perspectives and proportions of a complex building like a church was a huge challenge; Saenredam’s success was based on a painstaking process of measuring and understanding architectural spaces. He always followed the same procedure, first making a drawing on the spot – completely freehand, without even using a ruler. Then he would make careful measurements of all the architectural features in the view and use them to construct a system of three-dimensional coordinates. It is this which underpins the accuracy of scale and proportion. His measurements were precise: it’s possible to tell from his drawings whether his viewpoint was from a sitting or standing position or even from a raised platform or a ladder. He would use these drawings and coordinates to make a new drawing, scaled exactly to the size of the picture he wanted to produce, and then trace it on to the panel on which he painted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some 18 of Saenredam’s drawings survive. One, from 1636, shows the interior of the Buurkerk from the same viewpoint as we see here, though without any figures (now in the Municipal Archives, Utrecht). Our picture, dated 1644, corresponds with the right half of that drawing (which is divided in the centre by a hexagonal column). A painting derived from the other half is now in the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth, Texas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saenredam’s success, however, was based on more than an accurate understanding of architecture: he also knew how to adapt and exaggerate for effect. Comparing this painting with his drawing we can see that he has stretched the height of the columns, the spaces above the arches and the vaults. This gives a greater feeling of loftiness, emphasised by the way that sunlight floods the building. An ability to capture the play of light on stone was another great strength of his. Here it filters through the windows, glows and reflects with varying intensity on the piers, arches and cavernous spaces of the ceilings, and gleams on the tombstones and cracked red-and-white marble pavement.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Given that this is a church, there is a religious significance to the sense of a lofty building infused with peace and light. The Buurkerk was not a contemporary building: the columns and arches date from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries. But the church had been handed over to Protestant worshippers about 60 years before, in 1586, and then remodelled in the new, unadorned Protestant aesthetic. Saenredam implicitly celebrates this transformation. The walls, once multicoloured, have been whitewashed, the altarpieces removed, and the side chapels decommissioned.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are direct references to other religious themes too. Above the two boys in the foreground hang the Ten Commandments (laws on how to live properly, recorded in the Old Testament) and the head and shoulders of Moses, the prophet who received them from God. The theme of obedience is underscored by one boy’s attempt to train a small dog. While we can’t be sure that the boys were painted by Saenredam, they were almost certainly added by a contemporary artist, and so give an insight into how the painting would have been understood at the time. The other figures, almost certainly by Saenredam, contribute to our understanding of scale and perspective in the painting, as well as to a sense of the church as a social space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Graffiti on the column in the foreground gives the name of the church, the date and the authorship of the painting; the drawing above is a clumsy illustration of an episode from the story of the four sons of Aymon. This was a French medieval story, but in seventeenth-century Holland it was popularised in widely available and relatively cheap books (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Volksbuchs</span> or ‘chapbooks’) which retold epic stories about medieval knights. Four brothers are shown escaping on their magic horse Bayard, after one of them, Reinout van Montalbaen, killed the nephew of Charlemagne, Holy Roman Emperor, in a brawl. Graffiti was common in churches and it’s not clear whether Saenredam simply copied the drawing as he saw it, or whether he added it because Reinout was associated with church building. The story is a complex one, but Reinout eventually embraced a religious life and helped in the construction of Cologne Cathedral.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another of Saenredam’s paintings in our collection, of a church in the town where he was based: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUY-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Interior of the Grote Kerk at Haarlem</a></span>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between 1634 and 1637, Saenredam made a series of views of the interior of the Grote Kerk (or the Cathedral of St Bavo) in Haarlem, the city where he lived and worked – this is one of them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Even though it is a small picture, it required an enormous amount of work.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are few greater challenges in art than making the inside of a complicated building seem realistic. The way that our eyes perceive a three-dimensional line of arches receding into the distance, for example, is extremely hard to reproduce in two dimensions. But <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QFF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter Jansz. Saenredam</a> was brilliant at creating such illusions, and his depictions of church interiors were extremely popular in Holland in the mid-seventeenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between 1634 and 1637, Saenredam made a series of views of the interior of the Grote Kerk (or the Cathedral of Saint Bavo) in Haarlem, the city where he lived and worked – this is one of them. Even though this is a small picture, it required an enormous amount of work. Saenredam made sketches on site, followed by preparatory drawings based on precise measurements. He would then trace a final version directly onto the panel he was going to paint on.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite his care when measuring, he would make significant adjustments to the final painting, usually to emphasise the building’s grandeur or to get around difficulties with creating the illusion of perspective. Two original drawings for this painting have survived (they are now in the Haarlem Municipal Archives). By examining these and comparing them with the painting, we can see that he struggled to depict some of the distortions caused by his chosen viewpoint – one which allows glimpses into a series of complex spaces set at different angles, and seen through arches of different heights at different distances.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the earlier drawing, he actually gave up his attempts to make one of the arches look right and he didn’t quite solve the problem in the painting. The arch visible through the piers in the top right-hand corner of the painting is left hanging behind the column in the middle of the foreground. He also significantly exaggerated the size of these foreground columns, and deepened the spaces we can see through the arches. As a result the church appears far more monumental, with massive columns and distant vistas. It is an effect exaggerated further by Saenredam’s use of figures – people are scattered around the church, mostly in the distant background. They are out of scale, significantly smaller than they would have been in real life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Light floods the building, showing off its grandeur. Despite the fact that there was almost no colour in the church, Saenredam used different shades of grey and white to capture the filtered glow of a bright sunny day to brilliant effect. This also highlights the dark, angular shapes of the boards hanging on the columns. These are coats of arms, marking the location of the gravestones of noble families who were buried under the floor. It was one of the few decorative features surviving in a church which had been stripped of its colourful Catholic paraphernalia only a few decades before.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a dark interior framed by a stone arch, an elegantly dressed young woman plays a harpsichord for the man leaning on the instrument. Music is often related to love in Dutch paintings, but in contrast to other genre scenes of music making the couple don‘t appear to be flirting. The young woman is concentrating on her sheet of music, and the man only dares to glance coyly towards his companion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Latin inscriptions on the instrument provide a witty and ironic commentary and identify this as a scene of courtship. The words ‘SOLI DEO GLORIA’ (’Glory to God alone‘) appear below the keys, implying that the young woman is playing solely for the glory of God. Her lowered gaze and upright posture express dignity and emotional restraint. But the inscription on the open lid reads ‘ACTA VIRUM PROBANT’ (’actions prove the man‘): the young woman’s admirer, slouching over the instrument, is about to take more active steps. Through the open door in the right background we can see a pageboy approaching, carrying a theorbo (a large type of lute). The man will soon try to charm the woman by suggesting an intimate duet, which was at the time a common metaphor for two people joined in harmonious love.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The harpsichord was the largest stringed keyboard instrument in use from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century, and the one depicted here was probably painted after an existing model. Common examples like this one were decorated with patterned paper with printed mottoes and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3K-0008-0000-0000.htm">biblical</a> quotations. A similar design of seahorses and arabesque patterns above the keyboard can be found in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Johannes Vermeer</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lady at a Virginal</span> (Royal Collection). The painted instruments were probably inspired by the ones built by the famous Ruckers workshop in Antwerp.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as demonstrating his wit here, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Steen</a> has also proven his mastery in rendering different materials; the surfaces of the woven tapestry hanging in the background and the bright, shiny satin of the women’s skirt and bodice are especially noteworthy. By employing the device of the painted stone arch that frames the scene and focuses the viewer’s attention, we are made to feel as if we are spying on the couple.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Steen wrote his own name just above the keyboard of the harpsichord, typically where the instrument maker would have signed his work. The inscription also bears the date the painting was made. The last two numbers are no longer legible to the naked eye, but under the microscope the last number can be read as ’9'. Stylistic similarities with other paintings by Steen from around the same time seem to confirm that the work was painted in 1659, during the short period when the artist lived in Warmond, a village north of Leiden.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was the first painting by Jan Steen to enter the National Gallery’s collection, when in 1871 it was bought with the rest of the collection of Sir Robert Peel (1788–1850), former prime minister and trustee of the Gallery.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This sparkling little picture is unusual for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Steen</a> painting. We are outside an inn – The White Swan, to judge by its sign – rather than in its dark interior, Steen’s more usual setting. People are enjoying the evening sun, perhaps as much as the entertainment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sun makes long shadows, but touches of white here and there – shirts and collars, and a dot of a cap on the woman behind the fence – bring the more sombre colours of the buildings and other garments to life. The leaves of the slender birch trees shimmer and the rump of the bay horse gleams. The inn seems to be a well-run establishment: the building is in good order, the customers are well behaved and the flagons or jugs visible are made of expensive Rhenish pottery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The energetic pose of the man bowling suggests that he’s serious about his game and that, given a moment or two, the skittles will be scattered everywhere. His companions keep a close watch, as does the little boy with the crutch. Steen has captured their moods and characters with the minimum of facial detail, their poses and gestures enough to tell us about them. The man with his hat straight on his head leans forward, his arms behind him, perhaps a self-appointed referee. The man beside him, hand tucked in his shirt and hat jauntily on the side of his head, has a far more casual attitude – the flagon in his hand may be a clue as to why. Perhaps all is not quite as orderly as it seems. On the patchy grass beside the skittle party, a man sat next to the woman drinking from a long slender glass makes his plans for the evening clear with the hand sliding up under her cheerful, red skirt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painting in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> technique allowed Steen to work at speed and gave his images a spontaneity and liveliness that marks them out. Perhaps the fact that he owned and kept an inn brought him close to the people and incidents he painted, making them more immediate and true to life.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Paintings of life on the frozen waterways of Holland during the Little Ice Age were very popular with collectors at the time. Many artists, usually known for painting rivers or landscapes, produced them, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen van de Velde</a> was one of the most successful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But in this painting he has concentrated on individual characters and their activities rather than details of the icy landscape. He has shown little to suggest the freezing conditions, except the touch of frost on brittle grass to the left, the runners rather than wheels on two or three vehicles and a couple of people hunched up or cloaked. The landscape might be a river, or possibly a wide plane; the shadows don't have the shimmer of frozen reflection that ice might have.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Perhaps the warmth in the sun, which make the faces and the clothes of the men on the right glow, is what takes the edge off the chill. It’s as if van de Velde couldn’t resist making his sky soft and radiant, in the manner of Dutch artists who had been to Rome and whose style he adopted. The horizon is low, making the sky vast and allowing him to bring the vivid detail of his figures close to us. Compare this with the crowded, wintry scenes of Hendrick Avercamp, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPP-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Winter Scene with Skaters near a Castle</a></span>. In Avercamp’s painting, the view is largely imagined; in this picture, the distant outline of the Grote Kerk of Haarlem with its spindly spire is recognisable, and a nearby windmill breaks the skyline.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The men in the foreground play <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kolf</span>, the forerunner of golf. People of all ranks could take part, and it was guaranteed to draw onlookers to give opinions and advice. The player with jaunty red tassels on his petticoat breeches takes aim to hit the post put in position by the man just peeping out from behind him. In the centre, a man with a bag slung on a stick over his shoulder stops to watch, and a young lad – one of the coldest looking figures, hands stuffed in his pockets and a hint of snow on one boot – watches with his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kolf</span> stick at his side, as if longing to join in.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two women, one bundled up in a black shawl against the cold, her face hardly visible, ride in a heavy, boat-shaped sledge; a man in a ragged jacket, a skullcap and an apron strains to shove it forward. Behind him a woman in a white bonnet shares the task, but relaxes for a moment to stare out at us, almost smiling. In front of the sledge a second woman reaches forward as if running to catch something – perhaps the lively little dog yapping at some of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kolf</span> players. The single fine line of black paint that seems to start under her apron, passing behind the gawping lad to the sledge, suggests that she is bearing the brunt of hauling the heavy sledge over the ice.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A colourful hanging tapestry has been swept to one side to reveal a young woman seated at a keyboard. It appears to be dark outside this elegant room: a blue curtain covers the top part of the window, but the glass below it is black.The light which gleams on the curves of the base viol in the foreground and glints in the heavily dilated pupils of the woman comes from in front of the painting – an unusual effect in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vermeer</a>’s work. Usually daylight streams into his interiors from a window on the left-hand side of the picture. Here he has created an entirely different mood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is a mood that’s also defined by the picture that hangs so prominently on the back wall. This has been identified as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Procuress</span> (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston) by Dirck van Baburen, which depicts a ribald scene in which a woman working as a prostitute plays a lute and flirts with a client, while a brothel-keeper demands money from him. A copy of the painting was owned by Vermeer’s mother-in-law, in whose house he lived and worked, and he included it in another painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Concert</span> (stolen from Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Concert</span> shows two young women singing and playing a harpsichord while a man accompanies them on a lute.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible that Vermeer simply used the painting, unthinkingly, as a studio prop. But even if a contemporary viewer didn’t know the original, Vermeer has made it easy to decipher the theme. In the National Gallery picture, it is particularly prominent, taking up nearly a quarter of the picture space. It seems far-fetched to suggest that an artist who executed his paintings with such care would have given no thought to the implications of placing such an image so obviously in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is important because, in the seventeenth century, musical scenes like this could be understood in different ways. They were certainly associated with love and flirtatious gatherings of young people, but some were depicted as bawdy occasions fuelled by alcohol and tobacco while others were apparently entirely decorous. Vermeer painted several but tended to hedge them with uncertainties, leaving the viewer unsure about how they should judge the situation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The hint given by the background picture here is, for Vermeer, an unusually strong one. We probably shouldn’t take it too literally and assume that the woman in front of the keyboard is also working as a prostitute, but it does seem that we are being encouraged to wonder whether or not she has more than music on her mind. The viol in the foreground is another hint to consider. It not only suggests that she is waiting for an accompanist – the instrument’s shape was sometimes associated with women’s bodies.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This interpretation of the picture is supported by the theory that it was painted as a contrasting pair with <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CVV-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Young Woman standing at a Virginal</a></span>, which depicts a lone woman standing in front of a keyboard. The two pictures are exactly the same size, were made at about the same time and share many similarities. But the contrasts seem just as significant. The standing woman, pictured in bright sunlight, may be suggestive of faithful, monogamous love, whereas the woman in this evening scene may represent a more mercenary or licentious approach.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young woman standing at a keyboard holds our eye with a direct gaze. Suffused in the light which streams through the window, she seems caught in a moment of expectation and uncertainty. Perhaps we have interrupted her playing, or perhaps she is waiting for us so that she can start. But then maybe the empty chair in the foreground is significant: perhaps she is waiting for someone else. The large painting of a naked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, the god of erotic love, on the wall behind her may help us to understand the situation. It seems to be a signal that this is not just a scene of music making, but that the woman is waiting for her lover.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vermeer</a> made very few paintings and only about 36 survive today. Nearly all of these depict young women in calm, orderly domestic interiors, and often they are playing musical instruments, either alone or with one or more others. Such scenes were a popular genre in seventeenth-century Holland. Sometimes the theme was obviously bawdy, with tobacco and alcohol, then thought of as aphrodisiacs, featuring prominently. Sometimes they are apparently entirely innocent. More frequently, as here, the implications are left uncertain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In most of Vermeer’s paintings, he seems to invite us to question the virtue or diligence of the women concerned, but then rarely gives us enough clues to help us come to a firm conclusion. This unresolved tension was probably part of the appeal of his pictures to his clients – perhaps because they reflected the undercurrents of real life. Musical gatherings were popular, respectable social activities. But they were also a good way for young people to meet, so there was always potential for flirtation, or for philandering.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If we can’t be certain about what is on the woman’s mind, the painting does tell us a good deal about her social status. She is dressed in fine silks and a pearl-studded necklace, and she is clearly in the living room of a prosperous Dutch home – it has pictures on the wall, a marble-tiled floor and a skirting of local Delft tiles. The instrument she is playing is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">muselar</span> (a type of virginal or harpsichord) and it’s an expensive one: the landscape painted on the lid is a luxurious addition that could easily double the cost of such instruments. Though not depicted in precise detail, both this painting and the small landscape on the wall resemble works by Vermeer’s Delft-based contemporary Pieter Groenewegen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> seems to be in the style of Cesar van Everdingen who worked in Haarlem and Alkmaar (north of Amsterdam). A similar version of it appears in the background of two other paintings by Vermeer (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Woman Reading a Letter at an Open Window</span> in the Gemäldegalerie, Dresden; <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Girl Interrupted at her Music</span> in the Frick Collection, New York) and it may be the painting recorded in the possession of Vermeer’s widow in 1676, hanging in the room next to his studio. The image is derived from an emblem book of 1608 by Otto van Veen, which showed a series of pictures of Cupid enacting different mottoes about love. They were based on quotations from poetry and philosophy. The motto for the Cupid holding up a tablet or card like this one was ‘a lover ought to love only one’. Whether this might signal a warning or a commendation is impossible to know.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another painting by Vermeer, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CTX-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Young Woman Seated at a Virginal</a></span>, may throw further light onto the significance of this motto. There has been much speculation that the two paintings might be a pair. They are almost exactly the same size, and both appear to have been made at about the same time, dating on grounds of style to 1670–1672, which was at the very end of Vermeer’s career. They each show a lone young woman – one seated, one standing – playing a keyboard, looking directly out at the viewer. What is more, one woman faces to the left and the other to the right, so they would hang together well as pendants. The shared colour scheme – the same predominately blue and yellow palette with unusually extensive use of the extremely expensive blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>, ultramarine – also suggests they might belong together.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As a pendant pair it is tempting to believe that they also represent a contrasting narrative. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Young Woman Standing</span> would represent a virtuous, faithful lover, a sentiment reflected in the composition and lighting. The picture is flooded with sunshine and the perspective is direct and open, with clear, balanced vertical and horizontal lines. By contrast, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Young Woman Seated</span> could be understood to represent venal or mercenary love. She is shown at night behind a drawn-back curtain, a picture of a brothel-keeper on the wall behind. She is also depicted from a much more oblique angle, tucked into a shadowy corner. Such interpretations are highly speculative and we can’t be sure that this contrast was intended. Opponents to the theory point out that the two paintings seem to have had quite different histories before the nineteenth century. However, this does not rule out the possibility that Vermeer designed them as a pair but ended up selling them separately, or that a very early owner sold them separately as individual works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Whatever the truth of the matter, it isn’t only his ability to conjure up intriguing narrative uncertainties that makes Vermeer’s pictures stand out among all the painters of the Dutch Golden Age. He was also brilliant at capturing the subtle effects of light – how it reflects off different objects and surfaces and how it creates shadows of subtly different intensities. In this picture, we can sense the textures, the nap and the sheen of the woman’s silk and satin dress. At floor level the light on the grey-veined marble and white-and-blue Delft tiles seems somehow colder, while the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilt</a> picture frame glows in the sunshine.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This mysterious landscape of a dark wood bounded by the sweeping curve of a river was highly innovative for its time. The artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cornelis Vroom</a>, was the son of Hendrick Vroom, a well-known painter from Haarlem who specialised in seascapes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cornelis began his career working in the same genre as his father but he soon developed an interest in landscapes. He was extremely successful and highly regarded. Records show that he (or just possibly, his younger brother Frederick) received a very substantial payment of £80 from Charles I, and he had a relationship with the Stuart court for some years, though he continued to base himself in Haarlem. He also worked for the most important political figure in Holland, the Stadtholder, Frederik Hendrik.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Not many of his paintings survive, but this important early example shows why he was so admired as a new force in landscape painting. Instead of using trees to create a frame for the composition, with a gap through which you can see an attractive view – the traditional approach – Cornelis has focused on the wood. Yet he has still managed to create a sense of depth. The low vegetation, the river bank and the glimpse of a sandy track catching the evening light on the left form a deep foreground. Meanwhile the fields, bathed in sunshine, become a distant view stretching behind the wood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The trees are backlit with a bright sky, throwing them into heavy shadow and allowing Vroom to explore the effects of light filtering through leaves. Look closely at the foliage and you can see the myriad tiny brushstrokes and shades of green and brown, used to evoke the sun catching the treetops, the tiny gaps in the canopy and the deep almost black shadows in the depths of the wood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the precision of the painting, it’s hard to identify the trees definitively. The trees on the left are probably willows, which thrive near rivers; the one furthest right in the main group has more the shape of an oak. Willows make excellent trees for harvesting timber through coppicing, so in a country short of woodland we might expect to see more signs of human intervention in this landscape. But Vroom prefers to play down man’s impact – there is just a single lollipop-shaped coppice on the far bank. The other trees seem neglected, with dead trunks and branches clearly visible.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The tiny figures in the skiff – an oarsman and two hunched passengers – are bit players, as are the two cows ruminating quietly under the canopy’s edge. Their presence alerts us to the rough picket fence which runs along the edge of the wood – the only other sign of human activity, apart from the tower of what appears to be a windmill on the knoll in the far distance. If it is, then even this seems neglected: it has no sails.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Emanuel de Witte is best known for his pictures of church interiors, but he had begun his career as a figure painter and later in life started painting portraits. This is one of them. We know from contemporary documents that this is a portrait of one of his patrons, Adriana van Heusden, and her daughter. Adriana was the wife of de Witte’s landlord and patron in Amsterdam, Joris de Wijs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as presenting a wealthy woman out shopping, the painting is interesting in the way it uses striking perspectives – a technique which de Witte had developed in his architectural pictures. The diagonals and upright lines created by the struts and supports of the fishmonger’s stall frame the two women with dramatic effect, and give the picture a strong sense of depth. This effect is enhanced by the wet slippery fish, complete with gills, roe and entrails, which dominate the foreground.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QGT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Emanuel de Witte</a> is best known for his clear-lined, light-filled paintings of church interiors – for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EE5-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Interior of the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam, during a Sermon</a></span>. But he had begun his career as a figure painter and after more than 20 years of painting churches he  – on occasion – painted portraits. This is one of them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two reasons to assume that this is a portrait. Firstly, the woman on the left is presented in a very prominent way – she fills much of that side of the painting and is turned towards us as she makes a confident, even imperious, gesture to the fishmonger. The impish little girl peering out at us from behind her skirts also has the air of a closely observed individual, rather than a generic character.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">More importantly, there’s documentary evidence –  records of a complicated legal dispute over four pictures – which strongly suggests that this is a portrait of one of de Witte’s patrons, Adriana van Heusden, and her daughter. In 1658 de Witte moved into the Amsterdam house of a lawyer called Joris de Wijs, who was Adriana’s husband. In return for a salary, accommodation and board, de Witte agreed to give de Wijs all the paintings he made during the five years he lived in the house. One of these is recorded as a portrait of Adriana and her daughter at a fish market.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The records show that when de Witte moved out in 1663 he took this picture and three others with him, apparently in contravention of the agreement. After de Wijs had died, Adriana’s new husband, Johannes van Heden, sued for their return; de Witte had already sold them to pay off debts, and did not immediately comply with the court order to return them. After further sales, intrigue and deception, the pictures were finally returned to Adriana and her husband. This picture must be the one mentioned in this dispute – out of several fish market scenes painted by de Witte it’s the only one to include a little girl. We can also date it between 1661, when the new Haarlemmersluis fish market opened in Amsterdam, and 1663, when de Witte left de Wijs’s house.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait is an informal one. Adriana hasn’t dressed up in her finest clothes, as you might expect for a woman of her wealth and social status when having her portrait painted; she’s dressed as she might have been on a trip to the fish market. True, she wears a costly fur-trimmed jacket, but the skirt with an apron over it and the simple white headscarf are typical of what we see worn by woman in other paintings of such scenes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is also interesting in the way it uses striking perspectives – a technique which de Witte had developed in his architectural pictures. The diagonals and upright lines created by the struts and supports of the fishmonger’s stall frame the two women with dramatic effect, and give the picture a strong sense of depth. This effect is enhanced by the wet slippery fish, complete with gills, roe and entrails, which dominate the foreground.</p></div>

The city of Amsterdam employed people to keep dogs out of churches, but judging from how common they are in seventeenth-century paintings of church interiors, this was not always successful.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Light is also a key feature of the stained glass in the lower row of windows. The scene on the bottom half shows the Four Evangelists – Saints Matthew, Mark, Luke and John – seated around a table with their attributes. An angel approaches them; above its wings, clouds open to reveal a heavenly golden glow that is enhanced by the natural light coming through the window.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The small organ mounted on the wall to the right of the stained glass was in reality placed on the other side of the nave of the Oude Kerk, but de Witte has included it here to make the view more interesting.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting could be considered a companion piece to another by Emanuel de Witte: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Interior of the Oude Kerk, Amsterdam, during a Sermon</a></span>. It shows the same section of Amsterdam’s Oude Kerk (Saint Nicholas Church) but seen from the opposite position, in the north aisle instead of the south.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such paintings are not necessarily completely accurate depictions of church interiors. With some artistic license, details were added or moved to make the view more interesting. For instance, the small organ that de Witte painted in the other picture has here been transposed to the opposite side of the church, showing some insight into the artist’s working process. De Witte painted many churches while working in Alkmaar, Delft, Rotterdam, and lastly Amsterdam, where this painting originated.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The atmospheric light is eye catching, and gives the church an air of tranquillity. Two rows of windows are visible, and all the interesting stained-glass details are in the lower one. Three roundels crown the central window – the middle one shows a ship, the other two heraldic symbols. The ship might be a reference to Amsterdam’s position as a mercantile centre: the source of the city’s wealth was trade by sea and canal. The central roundel in the right window displays Amsterdam’s coat of arms, a red shield and a black pale with three silver Saint Andrew’s Crosses. An elaborate stained-glass scene makes up the lower half of the middle window. Here, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Four Evangelists</a> – Saints <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EU4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Matthew</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mark</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Luke</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">John</a> – are seated around a table, surrounded by their attributes. An angel approaches them from the left, and above its wings clouds open up to reveal a heavenly golden glow. De Witte painted the light effects with great mastery, clearly thinking about how light looks when it passes through stained glass.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The light that falls on the foreground group has come through the windows across the nave. A dog – it looks like either a Drentsche Patrijshond (Dutch Partridge Dog) or a Kooikerhondje – bathes in the light, and even it seems to pay attention to the preacher, who addresses his audience from the pulpit on the column (highlighting the importance of the sermon in the Dutch Reformed Church). The city employed so-called ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">hondenslagers</span>’ or ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">hondenmeppers</span>' to hunt down stray dogs and to make sure that the animals stayed out of churches, as their barking would distract from the preacher sharing God’s word. The congregation here, however, seems anything but distracted, either attentively listening or reading from the Bible.</p></div>
