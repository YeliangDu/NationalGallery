        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three figures seem absorbed in making music. The young woman playing the lute has propped her score on a book on the table, though her eyes seem focused on the upraised hand of the man seated opposite her. He seems to have another copy of the music and is marking the beat. It is hard to way whether he is also singing, or whether he is perhaps teaching or directing her playing. Meanwhile a man in a cloak and hat stands behind, also focused on his friend’s conducting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such scenes of couples or small groups of people making music were common in seventeenth-century Dutch painting. They reflected a popular social activity among wealthy and sophisticated families and as such they might symbolise the harmony of family life or friendship groups. But such parties were also an accepted way for young men and women to meet and were often associated with flirtation and erotic encounters – so much so that many song books of the time were exclusively devoted to love songs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As a result, these paintings often have sexual overtones: a young woman may hold a phallic symbol and her dress may be not be entirely modest; her suitor might leans towards her eagerly; there might be aphrodisiacs like wine or tobacco in evidence. But in this painting, the relationship between the three characters has been left uncertain. There is no clear flirtation between them; their body language is neutral; the lutenist’s dress is suitably modest. The set up seems entirely respectable.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A couple of subtle clues might tempt us towards a conclusion, however. There is a bed in the background – perhaps this is also on the minds of the protagonists – and a spaniel has wandered in through the open door; is he a symbol of animal lusts, or just a much-loved pet? On the floor under the table is a playing card: the ace of spades. Card games were often associated with vice, and especially with seduction (though generally the ace of hearts was used to signal this theme). It’s only a hint, but it is enough at least to set our minds wondering about what is going on behind the inscrutable expressions of the musicians.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s important to keep in mind that the situation is not a portrait of ‘real’ people in a ‘real’ situation. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ter Borch</a> – who specialised in such scenes of small groups of people set in elegant interiors – composed this from elements he had used before. For example, the spaniel appears in several of his paintings, including another in the National Gallery: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN8-0001-0000-0000.htm">An Officer dictating a Letter</a></span>. The woman and the central man appear separately in the same poses but in different company, and the silver box and candlestick on the table also appear elsewhere.  </p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as his ability to create an air of mystery, ter Borch was also particularly admired for his ability to capture the textures of fabrics. Here he contrasts the sheen on the lutenist’s soft satin jacket and dress with the matt weave and complex patterns of the heavy Turkish carpet which is draped over the table.  </p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">How do we decode this enigmatic scene? The central figure is dressed in the fashionable clothes, breastplate and black felt hat of a  military officer. He gestures, apparently dictating a letter to the man with the quill. He is wearing a breastplate and helmet, so must be a soldier on duty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Meanwhile their comrade – in the impressive blue jerkin – seems more interested in us, and stares directly out of the painting. A seventeenth-century audience would have recognised his spurs, sword and the bugle hung over his back. It’s the costume of a military trumpeter who would have served as a cavalryman, sounding orders during battle, making proclamations and delivering messages. So in this context we must assume that he’s a messenger waiting for the scribe to finish writing. His faintly amused look and the way he catches our eye creates a conspiratorial air: there is something about the letter which he seems to want to share with us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVN-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ter Borch</a> originally included a clear clue to what this might be but then changed his mind. Look on the floor just in front of the dog’s hind leg. After nearly 400 years the paint has faded to reveal a playing card laying face up on the boards. It’s the ace of hearts. This would have almost certainly been interpreted as a reference to romance, and a clear suggestion that it’s not a vital military message being drafted, but a love letter. Analysis shows that before, or just after, the painting was finished, ter Borch painted out the card, presumably to make the situation more enigmatic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Comparisons with similar paintings by ter Borch and his studio suggest that he may also have made another change: adding the spaniel to the foreground. Like the trumpeter the dog meets our eye, though with a bored rather than a bemused look. That’s perhaps not surprising. The letter writing has apparently gone on so long that one broken clay pipe has already been discarded on the floor and parts of the stem have been crushed by the fidgeting boot of the scribe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So without a certain amount of guesswork and a few assumptions, we can’t be absolutely sure what is going on – which seems to have been the effect ter Borch was seeking. He had begun his career in the 1630s as a painter of more traditional and rowdy guardroom scenes, but developed his own style of quieter, more reflective and enigmatic versions such as this one, often hinging on the writing or receiving of a mysterious letter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is not a portrait of ‘real’ people in a ‘real’ situations, however. Several elements of the composition appear in other paintings by him, including the dog (in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman playing a Lute to Two Men</a></span>) and the young officer, which is most likely a portrait of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caspar Netscher</a>, ter Borch’s most successful pupil.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A small group of people meet to make music and enjoy each other’s company. We look over the back of a chair to see a young woman playing the violin in way unfamiliar to us, with the instrument resting on the table upright, similar to how a cello is played. We see the detail of her stiff, braided bodice, the gathers in her delicate apron and the glint of a pearl earring as she looks down at her instrument with great concentration.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A man smiles at the young woman sitting at her ease on the right. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter de Hooch</a> has picked out her jewels, but without ostentation: a pearl necklace, long earrings and the ornament in her hair. The lace round the wide neck of her dress gleams a little and the red bows on her sleeve echo the red skirts swathed over her knees. The man, his broad brimmed hat jauntily tilted, toys with some food, while she holds a wineglass in her lap, stirring the wine with a slender metal stick.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has given hardly any architectural detail to the courtyard in which they sit, which is unusual for him. We know by the dress of the occupants and the expensive Turkish carpet on the table that this is a sophisticated establishment, but we have little idea of their surroundings and they don't share the sunshine outside. Instead, de Hooch has given prominence to the houses seen across the canal, which are similar to those on the canals of Amsterdam. The left-hand one bears a tablet with the date 1620 and is in the style of Hendrick de Keyser, a prominent and innovatory Dutch architect of the time. Between us and these houses is a pavement, a balustrade and a canal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After a move to Amsterdam, de Hooch began to paint sophisticated domestic settings and elegant figures in contrast to the tranquil middle-class interiors he had painted when he lived in Delft, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DGJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Courtyard of a House in Delft</a></span>. As in that picture, however, he has placed an enigmatic figure in the arch of an entrance. Here, it’s a man in silhouette; in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Courtyard of a House in Delft</span>, it’s a woman, and she is a little more clearly defined. Although they are there to help us understand the depth of the view beyond, both are turned away from us. De Hooch gives them an air of mystery and leaves us wondering why they are there and where, if anywhere, they are going.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of young women being plied with wine were common in seventeenth-century Dutch art and there was usually a certain frisson about the scene. Wine was considered an aphrodisiac, and the suggestion behind an image like this might be that the woman was working as a prostitute or that her virtue was in danger of being corrupted. In this case, although she is under some pressure to drink, she seems to be waving the glass away. Nevertheless, her expression is one of faint amusement rather than steely resolution.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man who studies his reflection in the mirror doesn't seem to be part of this narrative, and is strangely detached from the activity in the foreground. But he does draw our attention to another theme in this painting: the artist’s interest in reflections and the way that light plays on different surfaces. As well as the image in the mirror, the painter paid great attention to how the polished surface of the marble floor picks up the glow from the woman’s pink dress and the burnished fire dog. The way the sunshine catches the wine glasses, the hilt of the man’s sword, the door handle in the left foreground and the ceramic vases and silk curtains in the background is also carefully portrayed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of these effects were achieved in an unusual way. Gold leaf has been used for the highlights in the fire-dog (which is decorated with seahorses) and in parts of the gilt leather wall hanging to the left of the fireplace. The black and white floor tiles help create a sense of depth and space, and while this was a typical technique in this type of painting, it was usually done with highly regular geometric patterns. Here, the black and white marble does not seem to form a regular design.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture above the fireplace seems to be based on figures and elements taken from a print by Antonio Tempesta, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Abraham liberating his Nephew Lot</span>, one of a series of Old Testament  battle scenes which were published in 1613. However, it doesn’t seem to have any particular significance to the other themes of the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is unsigned and it has been attributed to at least 12 different artists, most of whom were working in Delft around 1655 to 1670. For example, it is comparable with the paintings of interiors made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vermeer</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT0-0001-0000-0000.htm">de Hooch</a> and can be related to experiments with perspective associated with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fabritius</a>. However, these attributions have not proved convincing, and most recently <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ludolf de Jongh</a> has been suggested. He was a Rotterdam painter who travelled a good deal and spent some of his apprenticeship in Delft. However, that was in the 1630s, before Vermeer, de Hooch and Fabritius were working, and the attribution to de Jongh remains only tentative.</p></div>

As a young man, he was in England as Secretary to the Dutch Embassy; at the age of 31, when this portrait was painted, he had already been granted a knighthood by King James I for his service to both countries.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But there is perhaps another reason for his choice of costume. While in England and an inexperienced diplomat, Huygens had written to his parents to tell them how worried he was at the state of his satin courtier’s clothes, damaged from riding. Now able to afford new garments that were the height of fashion, he would have appreciated the fresh look of the fabric and elaborate detail of the decoration -– the lace at neck and knee, the beaded panels, the suede boots – that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PT8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Thomas de Keyser</a> portrays.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The items de Keyser chose to put on the expensive carpet on Huygens’s table tell of his official duties and his many other interests and talents. These objects include a chitarrone, a plucked instrument with an extremely long neck. Huygens not only played, but wrote songs and sang well himself. Beside the instrument are plans, apparently showing architectural projects, and a pair of terrestrial and celestial globes. Behind him on the wall hangs the Huygens coat of arms and a tapestry showing the Christian Saint Francis with the Muslim Sultan of Damietta in Egypt. This legendary encounter became a model for interfaith discussion that Huygens, a Calvinist but always tolerant of other religions, understood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of all perhaps, Huygens is celebrated as a designer of internationally renowned gardens and as a fine poet and writer. He helped to create the building of the Mauritshuis, the home of Count John Mauritz van Nassau-Siegen, and designed the new gardens there, challenging French supremacy in garden design. His revolutionary ideas for the aristocratic garden found their way to England, especially at Hampton Court Palace. Subsequently, he made the elegant garden at his own summer house, Hofwijck, which can still be visited today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Huygens was probably the most influential figure in the cultural life of the Dutch Republic. He knew the scientists and artists of his day, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>, whose painting he admired greatly for its humanity, psychological insight and new techniques. Yet he chose to commission this portrait from de Keyser, from a generation before Rembrandt. De Keyser used an oak panel as a support on which paint could flow freely, allowing him to show immaculate detail difficult to achieve in Rembrandt’s looser style, but which suited Huygens’s taste at the time. The result is a portrait that celebrates the spirit of the new Dutch Republic embodied in one urbane and brilliant man.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the title of this picture is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Interior with a Sleeping Maid and her Mistress</span> it has become known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Idle Servant</span>. The young woman is slumped on a stool, head in hand, taking a snooze after the hard work involved in preparing a large meal; heavy pots and pans litter the floor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pots – incidentally giving us an idea of how little such utensils have changed in 400 years – look clean and the maid herself, neat and respectable. Only the open neck and rolled up sleeves of her shirt and her heavy skirt mark her as different from her mistress in her snowy shift and impeccably pleated apron. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QD9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolaes Maes</a> has posed the maid in the traditional position of Acedia, the personification of idleness – perhaps the reason for the change in title – but the mistress doesn‘t appear to be condemning her for a mortal sin. She shrugs her shoulders with a smile that seems to say, ’what am I to do with her?‘</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pots left on the floor and the cat trying to eat the raw goose behind the maid – a close look suggests that Maes had little idea about feline teeth – are evidence that this is, at the least, a happy-go-lucky household. There was a popular saying in Holland at the time: ’A kitchen maid must keep one eye on the pan and the other on the cat.‘ This maid is not managing to do either. Pictures like this were entertaining, but could also be used as an example of good – or bad – household management (look at Jan Steen’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESK-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Effects of Intemperance</a></span>, for example). Perhaps the rather staid-looking meal taking place in the room beyond the kitchen is an example of good behaviour in a polite family. The mistress’s smile also seems to suggest she’s glad to get away for a few moments.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The invention of showing a view of an interior room beyond the main room in the foreground, in this case up a short flight of stairs, is among the first of its kind. Maes took up the theme again several times, including in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Listening Housewife</span> (Wallace Collection, London), though in that picture the scene in the smaller room is where the bad behaviour is taking place, with the maid, who is far from asleep, entertaining her admirer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Maes was for a while a student of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are in a tavern, or at least that is what is implied by the objects on the table. There’s an innkeeper’s slate – blank, with a piece of white chalk lying by it unused – a pack of playing cards, a pipe, a silver cup, a tankard and what is probably a backgammon box. The sleeping woman is either the innkeeper’s wife, a serving maid or, possibly, a prostitute. In a way, it doesn’t matter. The painting is not making a judgement about her status or profession but drawing attention to her vices.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cards and backgammon were used for gambling, which was not a respectable activity for a woman. More seriously, she has been smoking and has probably fallen asleep because she has had too much to drink. The leering men are clearly amused by her state: one seems to use the stem of his pipe to draw open the front of her dress, while his friend looks on and laughs. Even the tavern dog has wandered over, curious to see what is going on.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the modern eye this is harassment, but in seventeenth-century Amsterdam attitudes were very different. It was not uncommon for women to drink alcohol or to smoke, but female drunkenness was disapproved of in polite society. Tobacco, considered an aphrodisiac, was a potential threat to a woman’s virtue. The Dutch did see a funny side to lax moral behaviour, and scenes like this, where such failings were mocked, were a popular genre.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Metsu</a>’s clients wouldn't have only appreciated the moral-comic theme; they were also connoisseurs of artistic technique. At the time Metsu was a young painter making his way in Amsterdam. Instead of specialising in a particular genre, as most artists did, he became something of a chameleon. He was able to adapt to whatever might be in demand, from interiors like this to portraits, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history paintings</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still-life paintings</a>. Here he has taken the opportunity to demonstrate his skill at depicting different textures: the pattern and weave of Turkish rug on the table, the sheen of the metal cup, tankard and the dog’s collar, the animal’s fur. The faces of the figures are also carefully observed and they form a trio of contrasts, one laughing, one highly focused and one fast asleep, oblivious. The rest of the canvas is more freely painted, which is typical of Metsu’s work at the time.  </p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caspar Netscher</a> shows two delightful children, both busy. The woman’s pencil guides the little girl as she stumbles through her reading, and the light from the window spills down on her. She’s immaculately dressed, a spotless white fichu round her neck, and her ringlets are held in place with blue ribbons that are echoed round her puff sleeve – the perfect child.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don‘t know if it’s the child’s mother or a maid helping with the reading lesson, but the woman’s posture isn’t quite as genteel as might be expected in a household with elegantly dressed offspring and a costly Turkish carpet on the table. Perhaps that’s all part of the joke. Whoever she is, the woman looks out at us, her hand on her knee as if she has just flopped it there with a sigh. The little girl is more intent on the task than she is.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Behind them a little boy, also flatteringly lit, kneels on the floor. At that time and until the early 1900s, boys wore skirts until they were five or six years old, when the wearing of breeches was celebrated as a rite of passage. Unlike his sister, the boy plays with a tiny dog. On the floor beside him are his discarded toys and a cheap broadsheet with coloured pictures – no sign of his sister’s serious reading matter. A discarded knucklebone, used in a game, lies beside it and, perhaps most important, a top. Overhead on the wall is a copy of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens’s</a> enormous painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4F-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Brazen Serpent</a></span>. It told an Old Testament story of sin and retribution, but it is well hidden in the shadows and therefore unlikely to have any bearing on the scene below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There may be a moral in the painting, though it was more likely to have been bought for amusement.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Propriety, order and temperance were important virtues to the Dutch in the seventeenth century. This was a predominantly Calvinist society which admired hard, diligent work and disapproved of waste and wantonness. But they also liked a good laugh. The great appeal of Jan Steen to his clients was not only the brilliance of his painting but that he could make moralising entertaining.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of his larger and best-known paintings, and is a typical scene of chaos and disorder underpinned with a moral message. The entertainment lies in trying to work out what is going on and the root cause of the upset, and in spotting visual puns and the disasters which are about to happen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of his jokes are immediately clear to us today. We can see that this is a household where the children and servants are taking over. They are feeding their lunch to the cat, wine to a parrot and roses to the pig, while a small boy reaches into the purse of the sleeping woman. Meanwhile, in the garden, a man is apparently seducing a young woman; she sits on his lap with a large glass of wine and rubs his foot with hers. Her dress reveals more than is modest, and the half-peeled lemon which sits on the table may be an allusion to an undressing which is to come.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">From a Dutch point of view, it is the sleeping woman who is key to understanding more about this topsy-turvy world. She is the mother of the household and responsible for the well-being of her family. Intoxicated with tobacco from the pipe which is falling from her hand and the wine which her daughter (or maybe it is her maid) is now feeding to the parrot, she has neglected her duties and her children are running riot. It is perhaps her husband who is caught in a clinch in the garden. The church under a stormy sky in the distance may or may not be intended to cast his transgression in a moral light, but the impending fate of the mother of the household is made clear by the contents of the basket above her head. It holds the birch with which Dutch criminals were beaten, and the crutch and wooden clapper which were used by beggars in the street.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But there is so much more here than a one-dimensional moral message. Steen also loved puns and visual jokes. The roses being fed to a pig, for example, are an echo of an old Dutch proverb, the equivalent of our ‘casting pearls before swine’. And the still life on the step is an inversion of a popular genre. It comprises some typical elements found in such paintings – the bread, cheese, fruit and jug – but tips them onto the ground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But while we decode what’s going on in this wonderfully chaotic scene, we shouldn't neglect the sheer beauty of the painting. Steen wasn’t only a great joker, he was also a brilliant painter. He can suggest the sheen of silk or texture of linen with rapid brushwork, but he can change the pace too. Look at textures of the weave on the basket, the feathers on the parrot’s head, the dented pewter tankard or the fur trim on the neglectful mother’s jacket.</p></div>
