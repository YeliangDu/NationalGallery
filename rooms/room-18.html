        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This uproarious crowd of mythical characters is noisy and ill-behaved, but meant to make you smile. An old man with bushy white hair and beard has lost his clothes during the revels. He’s unsteady on his feet but seems blissfully untroubled by his situation. He’s held up by two <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyrs</a>, though perhaps not for long. A young bacchant – a follower of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a>, the god of wine – squeezes grapes over the old man’s head, his wreath of vine leaves all askew.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Beside him, a bacchant plays the panpipes, his cheeks and nostrils flaring and his thick curls blowing in the wind. On the right, perhaps lit by the flames of a hidden bonfire, a third satyr wiggles his tongue lasciviously at an older bacchant, who, by the look of the heavy stick in her hand, doesn’t welcome his attentions. Looking on at the rumpus are two little <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a> who bring more grapes to add to the party. One wears a coral necklace, traditionally said to keep away the devil but seemingly having little effect.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The old man is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Silenus</a> – in Roman myth, the teacher and mentor of Bacchus. In the seventeenth century, Greek and Roman myths were popular as subjects for painting and drama, both comedic and tragic. Flemish artists in particular found Silenus a personification of everything ribald, exuberant and funny. He made an appealing subject, giving artists the chance to paint an old man, naked and drunk – comic but sometimes touched with pathos.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture came from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>’s studio in Antwerp, although we are not sure who painted it – it seems to have been a joint effort by several young artists working there. A German visitor to the studio in 1620, shortly after the picture was painted, wrote: ‘We saw a vast room without windows, but lighted by a large opening in the ceiling. There were gathered a good number of young painters who worked on different pieces of which Rubens had given them a chalk drawing touched here and there with colours. The young men had to completely execute these paintings, which were then finished off with line and colour by Rubens himself.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens had seen and admired Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></span>, in which a slightly younger Silenus slumps on a donkey, almost rolling off into the arms of a satyr. Rubens painted a scene similar to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Drunken Silenus supported by Satyrs</span> which is now in the Alte Pinakothek, Munich, and afterwards possibly drew a model for his pupils to follow in the way suggested by the German traveller. The sky and landscape may be by Jan Wildens and the grapes by Frans Snijders. But the superb rendering of Silenus’ bloated, happy face and the folds and bulges of his solid, glowing flesh strongly suggest that they were painted by the young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a>.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The infant Christ is the central figure in this painting, but he is the only one who doesn't look at us directly. Gripping his rosary (the Catholic prayer beads used to keep count of devotions), he gazes beyond the frame in contemplation, while Joseph, the Virgin Mary and the young John the Baptist stare forward.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jordaens likely painted this picture with Caravaggio’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna of the Rosary</span> in mind (the picture had travelled from Naples to one of Antwerp’s many Catholic churches in the early seventeenth century). The rosary beads resurface here and, combined with Christ’s outward gaze, they might hint at something beyond his childhood. The reed cross held by John stands in for the crucifix of the Passion (Christ’s torture and crucifixion), which was contemplated by means of the rosary prayer. Joseph, Mary and John address us, but Christ addresses his future.</p></div>

      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> look almost as if they are posing for a family photo. Joseph and Mary look outward, meeting the viewer’s gaze, as does the young John the Baptist, Christ’s cousin (the reed cross clasped firmly in both hands is his attribute). The infant Christ is the only one who does not look out at the viewer directly. He seems occupied with something else, his eyes turned to his right. All four figures are markedly close to the picture plane, adding to the sense of intimacy. There is limited space around them, but in the little there is we see a blue curtain falling loosely on what appears to be a sculpted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE4-0008-0000-0000.htm">cherub</a>, its wings folded in a heart shape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jordaens</a> converted to Reformed Protestantism later in his life, he mostly painted for Catholic patrons in his native Antwerp, where he arguably was the leading painter after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a>. A gifted draughtsman, painter and tapestry designer, Jordaens was familiar with the Christian subjects popular with the city’s patrician patrons. The artist returned to intimate depictions of the holy family a number of times in his paintings and drawings, although no other version confronts the audience as directly. Another <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family</span> by Jordaens (Nationalmuseum, Stockholm) is similar, and has the mother and child address their viewers; Joseph engages with a secondary figure holding a candle, however, and John is absent altogether.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jordaens' painting has a striking resemblance to one of his much earlier works, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Holy Family with the Infant Baptist</span> (Gemäldegalerie, Dresden). In that work, both John and a figure identified as either Joseph, Joachim or Zacharias look out at the viewer in a similar fashion. It has been suggested that Jordaens picked up the motif of the Christ Child standing on his mother’s lap looking out of the picture from Caravaggio’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna of the Rosary</span> – the altarpiece had been brought to Antwerp by the painters Louis Finson and Abraham Vinck, after Caravaggio left it in Naples before departing for Malta. In Antwerp, it was displayed in the Dominican church of St Paul, where it was seen by Rubens and Jan Brueghel, among others.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The prominence of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERT-0008-0000-0000.htm">rosary</a> held by Saint Dominic in Caravaggio’s painting is repeated here in the single string held by the young Christ. The beads contrast with his white flesh as he holds them up with both hands. The infant’s handling of the rosary combined with his distracted gaze might hint at something beyond his childhood: Christ seems aware of his death. The presence of John’s reed cross stands in for the crucifix of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a> (Christ’s torture and crucifixion), which was contemplated by means of the rosary prayer. While Joseph, Mary and John address us as viewers, Christ addresses what is to come.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are watching an intimate family moment, apparently unnoticed. Two children are being introduced – they are the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> and his cousin, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>. From right to left, Jordaens has painted the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, the two cousins and John’s parents, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EC6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Elizabeth</a> and Zacharias. Compared to his ‘portrait-like’ <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUD-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Holy Family and Saint John the Baptist</a></span>, this painting looks more like a narrative moment. Instead of facing outwards, the figures interact with each other; none of them acknowledges the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, the lamb next to John looks directly out at us, while a small bird flutters from its cage towards Christ. The Virgin is seated on a hooded wicker chair, with Christ on her lap; this type of chair, used for protection from drafts, can be found in several other paintings by Jordaens. Christ wears a swaddling cap lovingly decorated with flowers which frame his rosy-cheeked face. A red curtain, pulled back to reveal a column, frames Elizabeth and Zacharias.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This childhood meeting is not mentioned in the Christian Bible. It derives from a widespread apocryphal tradition in Italy and the Low Countries, and was popularised in both writing and images from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Early Renaissance</a> onwards. It prefigures the moment when Christ comes to be baptised by John, as told in the Gospel of Matthew (3: 13–17). According to the Gospel of John (1: 29), John the Baptist greeted Christ by describing him as the ‘Lamb of God’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bird in this and other versions of the composition has previously been wrongly described as a goldfinch, a symbol of Christ’s later Passion (his torture and crucifixion). However, the bird in this painting is missing the goldfinch’s distinctive red feathers on its head which, according to legend, it acquired when it removed a thorn from Christ’s head while he was on the way to Calvary, and was splashed with some of his blood.  The release of the caged bird prefigures the way that Christ’s sacrifice as the ‘Lamb of God’ will liberate the human soul.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jordaens painted different versions of this subject, and  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Virgin and Child with Saint John and His Parents</span> (North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh) relates most closely to this one. Very likely to be the prototype, the Raleigh version is signed by Jordaens and was probably painted around 1615–16; the London painting is an autograph variant painted about 1620.</p></div>

Rubens’s assistants would have used the sketch as a model from which they could complete the full-scale picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EK4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Diana</a>, the goddess of hunting, gave the huntsman <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FW7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cephalus</a> a magic dog and spear, both shown by his side here as he reclines beneath a tree, shaded from the light. Lost in love at first sight, Aurora, the goddess of the dawn, steps from her golden chariot and runs towards the handsome young man. Her white horses rear up, anxious to be gone. Rubens has captured Aurora’s eager rush towards Cephalus, leaning to him with outstretched arms. Her golden robes toss and fly behind her, and her gauzy underskirt clings to her bare legs as she runs, oblivious of the undergrowth. Cephalus sits up, his arms also outstretched, apparently eager to go with her – but in the best-known version of the story, told by the Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a> in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, he remains faithful to his wife, Procris, and Aurora leaves alone.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens has made his Aurora a strong, spirited and very human goddess, running through the undergrowth on sturdy legs, reminiscent of Titian’s Diana in his great picture <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Death of Actaeon</a></span>. Titian was a great influence not only on Rubens but on Flemish and European art in general in the seventeenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two other artists of the same period – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolas Poussin</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>, both French and living in Rome – were also working on paintings on the theme. In a dramatic painting entitled <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cephalus and Aurora</a></span>, Poussin shows the reason for Cephalus’ rejection of the goddess: a cherub holding up Procris’ portrait. Cephalus – his pose is based on Bacchus in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></span> – turns away and disentangles himself from Aurora’s clinging hands, a detail not included by Ovid. Claude depicted a later part of the story in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DD5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with Cephalus and Procris reunited by Diana</a></span>, his work of 1645. Procris, afraid that Cephalus was being unfaithful to her, went out into the forest to watch him. He mistook her for a wild animal rustling leaves and threw the spear with deadly aim, accidentally killing her. Claude’s idyllic landscape scene shows the moment that Diana brings Procris back to life, reconciles the couple and warns them of the dangers of jealousy and unfaithfulness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another oil sketch by Rubens in the Prado, Madrid, which shows the later part of the story, with Cephalus and Procris together after her revival. Also in Madrid is a painting by Peeter Symons, a little-known assistant of Rubens. The picture is based on the sketch of the second scene, but Rubens himself never painted a definitive picture of the story.</p></div>

In defiance of the edict, Clothar and Dagobert support Saint Bavo being received into the Church. Although the three main figures are surrounded by a crowd of people, it is the horses that dominate the composition, especially Dagobert’s silvery steed – its body covers the width of the painting.</p></div>

This scene, in which King Clothar and his son King Dagobert each sit astride a horse, appears on the right panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two kings, both dressed in armour and wearing gold crowns on their heads, hold their arms out to block the advances of a third figure, a herald of the Roman Emperor Mauritius. He thrusts a scroll towards the pair, which contains an edict from the Emperor forbidding his soldiers from becoming monks. In defiance of the edict, Clothar and Dagobert support Saint Bavo being received into the Church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The rich, dark blue and silver of Dagobert’s armour emphasises the silvery colouring of his horse with its shimmering white mane. The two horses dominate the composition, and the raised hoof of the one in front creates a sense of restlessness that emphasises the tension of the situation. The distress of the dog that is trapped beneath the horse and is in danger of being trampled further reinforces this feeling. Most of the composition has been painted quite thinly, using quick, sweeping brushstrokes, but the reflection of light on the armour of the kings and their horses is intensified by Rubens’s use of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>. Poles and flags indicate the presence of a crowd of soldiers in the background, and the attention to detail that Rubens paid to the central figures and their horses contrasts with the sketchy, loosely defined forms of the background figures who peer down at the scene from the balustrade. Rubens painted them in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a>, a technique he also used for the background figures in the central panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While the sketchy quality and pale colouring indicate that this oil sketch was used as a plan for a later painting, the highly detailed and brightly coloured figures in the centre show Rubens plotting out the picture more precisely. Some pentimenti can be seen with the help of X-radiography and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectography</a>, showing that Rubens made changes to the composition throughout the painting process. For example, the reins of the horse on the right have been altered, while the arch of the church building in the background originally had a steeper curve.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Thomas Howard (1585–1646), 2nd Earl of Arundel and Surrey, was a prominent figure in the reigns of James I and Charles I and, despite a chequered political career, was appointed Earl Marshal of England in 1621 and Lord Steward in 1640. He was also a distinguished patron and connoisseur of the arts, and amassed a huge collection of drawings and antique sculptures. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> met him on his visit to England in 1629/30, when Arundel was 44 or 45 years old. This portrait isn’t dated, but may well have been made during this period. We know that Rubens visited Arundel’s London house in August 1629, but since he is wearing a fur-lined winter coat, the sitting may have happened the following winter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist seems to have admired the Earl’s connoisseurship and described him as ‘an evangelist for the world of art and the great protector of our state’. He painted him three times. In two portraits – one apparently a preparatory study for the other – he is depicted as a man of action, dressed in armour and looking directly at the viewer (National Portrait Gallery, London; Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum, Boston). In this painting, however, Rubens has revealed a more intellectual, reflective – and perhaps even stern – side to Arundel’s character. The pose is unusual for this period. He sits rather stiffly, looking away from the viewer with a focused expression. His face, free of shadow, is framed by a white collar, which contrasts strongly with his dark coat and the gloomy background. Although he is not formally dressed, his status is underlined by the medallion which hangs from the blue ribbon around his neck. It is the Lesser George, an insignia of the Order of the Garter, the highest order of chivalry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While a date of 1630 would be consistent with Rubens’s painting style of the time, Arundel does seem somewhat older in this portrait than in the other two; he is more puffy-cheeked and his hair is greyer. It has been suggested that the portrait may have been made later and may be intended to recall an engraving by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a> of the humanist Willibald Pirckheimer (1524). It shows Pirckheimer’s head at exactly the same angle and, although Arundel’s torso is turned rather more to the right, the expressions on the faces of the two men are remarkably similar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Arundel acquired the original copper plate of the Dürer portrait in May 1636 when he bought the Pirckheimer library, and it is certainly possible that Arundel could have sat for Rubens in Antwerp on his return from a diplomatic visit to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Roman Emperor</a> in Regensberg in the same year. No visit is documented, but a description of Arundel by Sir Robert Walker, who travelled with him, has survived and it is intriguingly reminiscent of this portrait. According to Sir Robert, Arundel ‘was tall of Stature, and of Shape and proportion rather goodly than neat; his Countenance was majestical and grave, his Visage long, his Eyes large black and piercing; he had a hooked Nose, and some Warts or Moles on his cheeks; his countenance was brown, his hair thin both on his Head and Beard.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is a preliminary sketch for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HQH-0001-0000-0000.htm">central panel of an altarpiece</a> Rubens made for St Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent. It depicts a scene described in a biography of Saint Bavo that appeared in 1583, written by the theologian Joannes Molanus.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Bavo, formerly called Count Allowin of Haspengouw, was a Roman soldier who renounced his role in the military to become a monk. Here, he is shown being received by Saint Floribert, abbot of the monastery of Liège, who bends towards him, and Saint Amand, whose compelling sermon about the futility of material things convinced Saint Bavo to dedicate his life to God. Behind them, a cleric holds the black habit of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictine</a> monk, a replacement for Saint Bavo’s armour. In the foreground, a man hands out the saint’s riches to the poor, while two courtiers to the right appear to be looking on the scene with disgust. One of them even prods the beggars with his staff.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens has depicted this hectic scene in bright, vivid colours, using short and rapid brushstrokes. The way that light reflects off the surface of Saint Bavo’s breastplate draws attention to him, and the gold robes of the clerics seem to glisten in the sunlight. The brightness causes the background figures to appear hazy – Rubens has used a muted palette of pale grey and blue tones to paint them in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW9-0008-0000-0000.htm">grisaille</a>. Saint Bavo’s red cape also helps him stand out against the crowd: its colour contrasts with the grisaille background figures, the dark grey and purple shades of the courtier’s doublet and the yellow, brown and grey tones worn by the other saints and monks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The detailed features in the foreground and centre also contrast with the background figures, which are roughly sketched out as a mass of forms without individual characteristics. Rubens produced hundreds of oil sketches; some were used to plan out the composition and particular details of a painting, as seems to be the case with this one, while others were so detailed that they appeared to be finished paintings in their own right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some pentimenti can be seen using X-radiography and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectography</a>. The face of the deacon who stands behind Saint Amand has been altered, and there may have been the head and hand of another beggar just to the left of the man who hands out Saint Bavo’s money. The positions of some of the children surrounding the mother in the foreground have also been changed.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Peter Paul Rubens’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Samson and Delilah</span> portrays a tragedy of love and betrayal. According to the Old Testament, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Samson</a>, a Jewish hero blessed with superhuman strength, killed a thousand Philistine soldiers with the jawbone of a donkey. The Philistine leaders wanted revenge. They bribed Delilah, the woman Samson loved, to discover the source of his strength. After several attempts she persuaded him to tell her his secret: his God-given strength lay in his hair, uncut since he was born.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Rubens’s picture, Samson lies in Delilah’s lap, his dark head resting on the deep crimson of her robe, his powerful body seeming vulnerable in sleep. Delilah’s dishevelled dress, her loosened hair and exposed breasts suggest a sleep after making love. She sits motionless, her face beautiful but almost inscrutable while her accomplice snips away at Samson’s hair. Perhaps it’s possible to read a trace of triumph or pity – or both – as she gazes down at Samson, but only her hand placed gently on his shoulder lets slip a whisper of regret. In radiant pools of light, her soft flesh glows, her golden hair brushes her shoulder and luxuriant textures surround her; all evoke the sensuality of the love now lost. Just one flaring torch illuminates the soldiers waiting outside to capture Samson.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But perhaps Delilah will pay for her treachery. Rubens carefully placed an old woman directly behind her, and mirrored their two profiles. The old woman’s is withered but bears a striking likeness to Delilah’s, perhaps suggesting – in the manner of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FI8-0008-0000-0000.htm">vanitas</a></span> – that she will one day lose the beauty that was Samson’s downfall. Similar old women are sometimes portrayed as brothel keepers in moralising paintings of the time, but we don’t know if this was Rubens’s intention. In the Old Testament there’s no suggestion that Delilah had any such connection – rather that this was a love affair, making her betrayal even more cruel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Moreover, in the act of treachery itself, Rubens follows the Old Testament description absolutely accurately: Delilah doesn‘t cut Samson’s hair, but gets a man to do it for her. Some have suggested that Rubens chose to show the man’s hands crossed in a position sometimes thought to be symbolic of treachery. It seems more likely that he was demonstrating his skill at painting the hands performing such a delicate action – accurately placed for cutting the curl at that angle and without waking the sleeping man. He also echoed the position of the accomplice’s left hand in Samson’s own, but Samson’s is relaxed rather than in a state of tension.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens painted Samson and Delilah on his return from Italy for the private collection of his friend and patron, Nicolaas II Rockox, the mayor of Antwerp; the theme was popular in the Southern Netherlands at the time. The picture was designed to hang above the mantelpiece of Rockox’s large town house and Rubens chose rich, strongly contrasting colours to contend with the brilliance of the flickering flames of the fire. Rockox was an antiquarian with a large collection of Roman and other classical artefacts. For this reason, perhaps, Rubens included objects that – while not authentic – perhaps give the atmosphere of ancient Rome: the brazier blazing beside Delilah and the tripod it stands on, her bed with the horses’ heads, and the ewer high up on the wall beside it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Above all – and a true borrowing from<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm"> antiquity</a> – is the sculpture in the wall niche above the group in the background. Venus, the Roman goddess of love and beauty, stands looking down on the scene with her son, Cupid, god of erotic love. He clings to her, his head raised towards her as if asking a question: why this end to love? Although Venus doesn‘t wear her traditional girdle, said to make her irresistible to anyone she chose to seduce, Rubens has given Delilah such a band over her breasts, adding to her voluptuousness – and implying that she too could not be denied.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While in Rome, Rubens had seen the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a> and sculptures such as the Farnese <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Hercules</a> and the Belvedere Torso, from which he made drawings. These gave him the basis for the musculature of his sleeping Samson. He looked more specifically to Michelangelo for Delilah’s pose – to his sculpture of Night on the left of the sarcophagus of the tomb of Lorenzo de Medici in Florence and to his painting of Leda and the swan (<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G4C-0001-0000-0000.htm">a copy of which</a> is in the National Gallery’s collection). But while the resemblance to the pose is strong, Rubens gave his Delilah more sensual grace, femininity and subtle expression. In Rubens’s painting, Delilah’s thighs are concealed under the swirl of the rich silk of her robe, more tactile and more subtle than Leda’s bare flesh.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio’s</a> experiments in chiaroscuro also had a great impact on Rubens. He came to realise how this high contrast between light and shadow conveyed powerful atmosphere and dramatic tension, and used it to the full in his great painting. Chiaroscuro, he discovered, could make flesh glow and objects reflect and shine. Shadows could build a sense of fear and dread. Even if we don’t know the story, the flickering light captures the drama of the complex group where Samson’s hair is being cut, with every eye focused on that curl. And just the single flare of a torch on the glittering eyes of the soldiers waiting in the dark, pushes the tension to the extreme.</p></div>

Here, it seems that any great man taken to heaven and granted immortality by the gods has quite a journey ahead of him. George Villiers, Duke of Buckingham, dressed in a seventeenth-century version of Roman armour, is hauled up through the sky in a swirl of moving figures, his sword dangling below him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The strong red of the Duke’s billowing red cloak outlines him, emphasising his position at the centre of the figures that spin around him in a kaleidoscope of gold, cream, ochre and rosy pink. Two mythical beings give him a leg up from below, giving the impression that it’s no easy task. One of them casts a nervous eye over his shoulder at the threatening lion just entering the fray. Below the Duke, the allegorical figure of Envy reaches up to pull him down. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Minerva</a>, goddess of war and wisdom, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a>, the messenger of the gods, lead the Duke onward and upwards. On the left, the nude figures of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Graces</a> reach up to hold out a crown of flowers towards the Duke, but his eyes are turned up towards his goal, high above on the left: the Temple of Virtue. There, Virtue and perhaps Abundance (the figure is not yet positively identified) await his arrival. All around, naked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a> dance and caper or blow trumpets at the clouds, adding to the excitement and commotion of the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a preparatory oil sketch for a painting intended to decorate a ceiling, as the circular form and the skilful foreshortening of the figures indicate. Rubens had met Buckingham in 1625 in Paris, where the Duke was attending the marriage by proxy of Charles I of England to Henrietta Maria, sister of Louis XIII of France. In 1627, Buckingham commissioned the painting along with an equestrian portrait of himself for York House, his London residence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A favourite of both Charles I and his father James I and VI, Buckingham clearly saw himself as almost as powerful as royalty. At one time it was supposed that the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Apotheosis</span> had been painted in 1628, after Buckingham’s assassination. It is now generally agreed that during his lifetime the flamboyant Duke liked the idea of an image that showed him being transported to heaven by the gods like a king, unaware that his death was closer than he thought. The painting outlived the Duke by around 400 years, but both ceiling and portrait were destroyed by fire in 1949 – only this spectacular picture survives.</p></div>

The scene is taken from the Old Testament: God had sent a plague of ‘fiery serpents’ to punish the Israelites for their sinfulness and lack of faith (Numbers 21: 6), but anyone who followed Moses' instruction would be protected. Curled brushstrokes show where snakes fall from the clouds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of the group ignore Moses’ warning and are left to wrestle with the snakes that coil around their bodies and bite them. The woman on the far left raises her hands in distress; her skin is pale and clammy, as if she is on the point of death. By contrast, the woman in the centre wearing a black dress stares directly at the bronze serpent and is protected from harm. Her warm, glowing complexion and golden-blonde hair distinguish her from the mass of figures around her. The dramatic, tempestuous sky and writhing bodies increase the intensity of the scene and make the fixed gaze of this woman even more unusual. It’s thought that she is based on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>’s young second wife, Hélène Fourment, who he included in many of his later pictures. The young boy sitting on her lap may be their eldest son, Frans, who was born in 1633.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While Rubens has depicted distinct individuals in this picture, some of the figures, including the old man and woman, were models he used in some of his other pictures. He probably painted this in the late 1630s, towards the end of his life, and while he did the majority of the picture, it’s likely that the composition was blocked out by some of his studio assistants with the help of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FI6-0008-0000-0000.htm">modello</a> he had produced. Some pentimenti are visible to the naked eye: the thumb of the woman in the black dress was once longer, while the child to the left originally looked out of the picture and rested its chin on its hand. Just beneath the baby held aloft by a woman who originally wore a white dress, the face of an old man has been painted out.</p></div>

Three claimed the title – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Minerva</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Juno</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a>, chief of the gods, declared that Paris should be the judge, and it is this moment of choice that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> has depicted.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the version of the story by the Roman poet Lucian that Rubens used, Paris was unable to decide on a winner when the goddesses were clothed, so asked that they should disrobe. On the left, Minerva, goddess of war and wisdom, pulls her robe over her head. Her owl is perched on a tree above, her weapons are by her side. On the right, Juno, Jupiter’s wife, lifts her cloak to one side. At her feet, the peacock by which she is recognised reaches forward with a hiss at the sheepdog lying at the young shepherd’s feet. For Paris hands the golden apple to Venus, goddess of love, in the centre. She wears her tokens, pearls and roses, in her hair. Her little son, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, god of erotic love, crouches on the ground behind her. Venus clutches her robe to her breast as if surprised she has won, but the goddesses had all cheated. Juno offered Paris wealth and power, Minerva offered wisdom and strength. Venus promised him the most beautiful woman in the world, Helen, who was married to King Menelaus of Sparta – an irresistible gift.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens has turned the story into a rural idyll, with a far-reaching landscape set in the soft evening sun. The three nude figures each show a different aspect of the female form, painted with a sensitive, almost tender understanding of the body in various states of subtly conveyed emotion. The textures of silk, velvet, feathers and hair brushing against pale flesh glowing in the light are Rubens at his sensual best. Only a few grey clouds and the reflection of the gorgon Medusa with the snakes in her hair in Minerva’s mirror disturb the scene, suggesting that peace won’t last.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">And Juno made sure there was no happy ending. Almost hidden in the clouds above the heads of the figures here is the implacable Fury, Alecto. In a jealous rage, Juno commanded her to wreak havoc on the Trojans. She caused Paris to abduct Helen, and the famous Trojan War began.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting depicts a critical moment in classical mythology. The man on the left with his back to us is Paris, who had been raised as a shepherd, unaware that he was actually a prince of Troy. By fateful chance, he was asked to judge a beauty contest between three goddesses and to award a golden apple to the winner. Although the original story is Greek, here we see the Roman version with the goddesses <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Juno</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Minerva</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, who is attended by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>. To help him make his decision, Paris has asked them to undress, while each goddess has also offered him a bribe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see Paris hand the apple to Venus, won over by her promise to reward him with the love of the most beautiful mortal woman – Helen, the wife of King Menelaus of Sparta. It is a choice that will lead to Paris’ eventual abduction of Helen, the Greeks' attempts to recapture her and the siege and eventual destruction of Troy – the epic story told in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Homer</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Iliad</span>. Here, his decision is not depicted as a portent, but is hailed by the god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a> standing behind him, while four <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putti</a> descend from the sky to assist in Venus’ coronation. Juno, a look of fury developing on her face, reaches out as though to try to intervene, while Minerva, her back to us, has yet to react.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene was a popular one among patrons and artists in the seventeenth century – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> painted it six times, including a much <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CWQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">later version</a> which is also in the National Gallery’s collection. It evoked both literary learning and sexual frisson – an opportunity to display at least three female nudes in one painting, very often from different angles. The three women could be shown still competing for Paris’ attention or reacting to his decision. Here, Rubens seems to have changed his mind about which moment to depict. Preparatory sketches and pentimenti (earlier brushstrokes covered up by the artist but which have become visible over time) show that Paris’ right arm was originally bent round holding his crook, but Rubens decided to straighten it to show him holding out the apple to Venus.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Made in about 1600, when he was only 23, this is the earliest painting by Rubens in the National Gallery’s large collection of his works. It was made either just before he left his home town of Antwerp to travel to Rome, or soon after he arrived in Italy, and still shows much of the influence of his training in Flanders. The putti in the sky are very similar to figures by Rubens’s teacher, Otto van Veen, and the distant landscape is in the style of the Antwerp school of landscape painters. The composition is based on a design by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>, who was Italian – but this would have been available to Rubens in Antwerp as an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIC-0008-0000-0000.htm">engraving</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By depicting the muscular Paris naked in the foreground, Rubens invites us to compare ideals of the male and female nudes. The two figures peeping at the scene behind the foliage are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyrs</a>, creatures associated with lust. They also remind us of our status as voyeurs, as does the water nymph seated with the river god on the right side of the painting. She is the only figure not preoccupied by the events of the moment, and gazes directly at us with a knowing look.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to the Gospel of Luke (5: 1–11), <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> one day approached two fishing boats on the Sea of Galilee. After boarding one and preaching from it, he told the fishermen to cast their nets. Although they had worked all night and caught nothing, the fisherman agreed; when they hauled the nets back in, they were near breaking from the bountiful catch. Astounded by this miracle, the fishermen became disciples of Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a sketch on paper, intended as a model for an engraving by Schelte à Bolswert. The composition is based on the central panel of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a>  that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> made in 1617–18 for an altar in the church of Notre Dame au delà de la Dyle in Mechelen. It was commissioned by the Mechelen Fishmongers' Guild during a short period of prosperity after a difficult 50 years for the fishing industry. The figures in the central group are depicted in very similar positions in the sketch and triptych panel, although Christ appears rather differently in Rubens’s original picture. There, both of Christ’s feet are planted firmly on the floor of the boat and his body is given further solidity by the structure of his robe, which does not billow in the sea air as it does here. The sketch has a landscape orientation, unlike the panel, which allowed Rubens to extend the scene, adding two more figures in the bottom right corner – they are submerged in the sea, helping to haul the heavy net out of the water. There is also an additional figure in the upper left of the sketch: a man rowing a second boat towards the one in the foreground to help them with their weighty load.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens produced this sketch using chalk or pencil, with the modelling of the figures highlighted with ink washes and some of the features strengthened with pen and ink. Sections of the sketch have been finished off with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>. Bolswert’s engraving is relatively faithful to Rubens’s sketch, apart from subtle details such as Christ’s nose, which is straighter, and some of the disciples’ heads, which are more clearly defined.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of the rape – or abduction – of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F65-0008-0000-0000.htm">Sabine</a> women would have been well known to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> and his clients. It was a famous moment in the legends surrounding the founding of Rome, referred to by several classical writers, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EA9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Plutarch</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgil</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Livy</a>. The accounts vary, but key details are consistent: Romulus, founder and then king of Rome, had built an impressive city, but there was a desperate shortage of young women. He came up with a ruse to resolve the problem. He invited the Sabines, who lived in the mountains north-east of Rome, to bring their wives and daughters to a festival of chariot racing in celebration of the god Consus. At a signal from Romulus, the Romans betrayed their guests – they abducted the young unmarried women and drove the rest away, then forced their captives into marriage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this monumental painting Rubens has conjured up a complex scene of high theatre. He has used classical columns and arches (which are hung with garlands celebrating the games) to evoke a stage, and has created a sense of depth by arranging the figures in three planes. Those in the foreground are depicted in more detail and with stronger colours, those in the middle ground are in paler pastels and those in the distance are only sketched in.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The drama unfolds from the right-hand side of the canvas, where Romulus is seated in silhouette. He points towards the dais, a signal for the women – who have apparently been placed there so that they can watch the games – to be taken. They reel back in distress, a writhing mass of gesticulating limbs and anxious eyes. In the foreground, meanwhile, we get a close-up view of the first victims being carried away. The scene of men fighting in the background is harder to interpret, but as two of the women are clearly appealing to the soldiers for help and one horseman is looking at them in alarm, it most likely represents the Romans holding off the attempts of the Sabine men to protect the women.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rubens was clearly concerned to emphasise the violence involved in the abduction. There is a clear contrast between the dark, muscular figures and determined frowns of the Romans and the pale-skinned, wide-eyed helplessness of the women. And while he has depicted the soldiers in classical dress, the women are wearing seventeenth-century costume – as far as the viewers were concerned, they are not Sabines but contemporary Flemish ladies. The figure nearest us summarises their plight. Held in in the sinewy clutch of her abductor, she clasps her hands in supplication to the gods, her facing shining with tears. But for all the violence involved, Rubens also eroticised the moment – several of the women have their breasts exposed, while a soldier lifts the skirts of another.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pose of the soldier on the extreme left with the short sword and shield, is reminiscent of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Borghese Gladiator</span>, an antique sculpture that Rubens had seen when he was working in Rome. The woman in a pink dress looking down from the back centre of the dais may be a portrait of the artist’s second wife, Hélène Fourment.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is an oil sketch Rubens made in preparation for an altarpiece for St Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent; it shows the scene that appeared on the left panel. The two women wearing gold crowns are Saints Gertrude and Begga, the sisters of Saint Bavo (who appears in the central panel). Saint Bavo was a Roman solider, but he left the military to become a monk; his sisters followed his example by becoming nuns.

Her head is tipped back and her eyes are raised as if towards heaven. Her gown, its gold embroidery visible on the hem, shimmers in the light, emphasising the wealth that the family are about to give up.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of three oil sketches <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> made in preparation for an altarpiece for St Bavo’s Cathedral, Ghent. This scene appeared on the left panel, while the central panel depicts Saint Bavo being received as a monk by saints Amand and Floribert. The two women wearing gold crowns are Saints Gertrude and Begga, the sisters of Saint Bavo. Judging by her closeness and familiarity, the woman in the white headdress is probably a companion of the sisters, possibly Saint Bavo’s daughter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The trio stand on a ledge, their bodies positioned towards the scene in the central <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a>. Gertrude and Begga followed their brother’s example by relinquishing their privileged lifestyles to become nuns. Gertrude is shown clutching her long gold necklace in order to remove and discard it. The opulence of the sisters' embroidered gowns and gold jewellery draws our attention, the thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a> applied by Rubens using quick, short brushstrokes giving the impression of light reflecting off of these luxurious materials. These details are more clearly defined than those in the rest of the panel. This is especially noticeable with the figures in the background on the staircase, who have been depicted as hazy blocks of colour rather than clearly defined forms. The group of people crouching in the foreground are an extension of the scene in the central panel, where a man donates Saint Bavo’s riches to the poor, and gaze towards it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the sketchy quality of some of these figures, lots of small details bring the chaotic and crowded scene to life. A little dog jumps up by Saint Begga’s feet, while in the foreground a baby clings to the head of its breastfeeding mother, a chubby finger stuck in its mouth and a worried expression pointed in the direction of the man behind them. A young child next to the woman holds out a tunic, ready to catch the coins that are being handed out. The man behind holds one of these coins in his hand, gazing at it with a look of awe on his face.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some pentimenti can be seen using X-radiography and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared reflectography</a>. The arm of the boy who clings to the pillar at the top of the composition was originally shorter, and the leg of the boy below him was originally further to the right.</p></div>
