        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the seventeenth century the Little Ice Age settled over Northern Europe. Rivers and canals in Holland froze over and people took to the ice for work, leisure – and accidents. Hendrik Avercamp, just starting out as an artist, took to it too. His life’s work became the depiction of winter scenes full of incident.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These are the people he knew; he had grown up among them. Under the grey light of a winter’s day, but warmed by the soft pink of a cloud creeping across one side of the vast sky, they continued their lives almost unchanged – they did business, gossiped, tended children, had fun – but sped up on skates.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the right, a huge barrack-like building, made less forbidding by cheerful red bricks tinged by the pink of the cloud, is possibly a brewery. In front of it, where the light on the snow is brightest, an old man sits on a wooden chair, a blanket over his knees. He is said to personify winter, often shown as an aged person, wrinkled and frail. The man leaning against the stone vat outside the building seems untroubled by the cold, unlike the young woman huddled up in the boat stuck in the ice close to us, her hands under her black apron to keep them warm. In the corner, a fashionable young couple show off their new outfits, determinedly stylish in spite of the chill breeze that riffles her sash.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The view opens up behind the outbuilding at the end of the bridge, bringing more incidents to catch the curious eye. In the distance, men play <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kolf</span>, the forerunner of golf. A little nearer a mother bends over a small wooden sledge to tuck in her children and make them cosy. But her husband, holding the sledge reins, has eyes elsewhere. A young woman has taken a tumble. She has lost her hat and her skirts are dishevelled. A cloaked man with a peaked cap points at her with a skip of glee as he looks up her petticoats.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Not everyone is as frivolous. To the left, stately women are driven past the incident in a horse-drawn sleigh with a tiny white horse on the back as a coat of arms. Over by the outbuilding a man hurries home, his long fishing pole over one shoulder, dangling a meagre catch. Behind him a square hole in the ice cut for fishing. He passes a gossiping group of smart people, the woman with her hands in a muff, her face covered in a mask to cover her complexion from the cold.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little further away a red, white and blue flag flies proudly. It’s the flag of the Dutch Republic, newly released from years of rule from Spain. Avercamp, like many artists of the time, made it a feature to appeal to the newly independent burghers who would buy his work. His pictures would hang in their homes to entertain and amuse, but also to be regarded with patriotic pride.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Seventeenth-century Dutch winters were notorious for their Arctic cold, with canals and rivers frozen over. In the town that Avercamp takes us to, everyone is out on the ice making the best of it: working, playing, showing off, laughing, complaining, falling over or just about managing to stand up. Boats are frozen in, horses pull sleighs over the ice. The luscious pink castle looks almost like a giant, iced Christmas cake. Birds chirp cheerfully on the leafless branches of the trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P7D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hendrick Avercamp</a> led the way in making pictures of ‘life on the ice’. His painting career started around the time the Little Ice Age hit Northern Europe; he spent it producing these winter pictures and only rarely left his little town of Kampen – though the painting shows an imaginary place, not Kampen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We look down from a height, so that the view of the town and beyond is wide and open. Each tiny figure is no bigger than a fingernail, yet even if they have their back to us, we know what kind of person they are, and we can discover the story of each one. Between the trees near to us, a group of rich and poor alike mingle and indulge in people watching – just as we do through the round peephole of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little to the right of the group, and we‘re in the realm of real finery. This couple would have spent a fortune on their amazing costumes, hardly suitable for skating but the height of fashion and a must to be shown off. The man’s sword is an encumbrance but at least they’re well padded if they fall. Further to the right, a splendid sleigh with a gold coat of arms on the back jingles into the picture. Three couples, hand-in-hand, parade up the centre as if in a formal dance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the left, by the brown house with a window-shutter that needs mending, a snowball chase is going on: two bad lads are after a girl who has a snowball sticking to her back. A toddler escapes, arms outstretched towards mum and dad, who lean over the gate to see the fun. With a couple of tiny strokes of the brush Avercamp makes the toddler run yelling to them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In front of the castle sits a man huddled in a blanket, a hat plonked flat on his head. Unbelievably, his legs are bare and his feet appear to be immersed in water through a hole in the ice. A punishment? Some sort of cure perhaps? Just behind him, another man falls with a splash through thinner ice close to the castle wall. And prominent, attached to the side of the tower, a small grey privy – or toilet – is put to copious use, regardless of anyone who might be standing below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Avercamp was acutely aware of bodies in movement, expressing emotion and when making sound. Each minute figure has a distinct, often comic, personality, with a voice. They were prepared in tiny, meticulous drawings, some tinted with watercolour. He then transferred them into the painting with a few economical strokes of the brush, crowding the canvas with cameos of life on the ice. We seem to hear the cries, splashes, chatter, the horse’s hooves, the swish of the skates – the whole exuberant life that comes from his vibrant paintings.</p></div>

Although the vessels are not glamorous in themselves, van de Cappelle has exaggerated the height of the masts and bathed the graceful folds of sails in warm sunlight to give the image its majesty. Its haunting quality comes from the stillness, the soft, muted colours and the luminous reflections.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Because the vessels are almost hidden in shadow, the eye is first drawn out through the narrow passage between them and across the calm estuary stretching far away towards the cobweb-fine towers of a distant town. But these boats are crowded with incident and activity for the patient eye to find. The ferryboat of the picture’s title is probably the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">wijdschip</span> with one sail draped like an elegant curtain and the other furled into a spiral. Its two blue and white flags suggest that it’s from Texel, a busy port in North Holland. Well-dressed people sit about on deck, waiting for the wind to start their journey. Men on the small barge in front of it unload goods, the bright red breeches of one of them enlivening the picture. To the right, a barge carrying the Dutch ensign is rowed out, perhaps to the ferry. On board are three black-clad officials, possibly lawyers, deep in conversation. Behind them people are crowded together under a canopy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In front of this barge, close to us, is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pont</span>, a flat-bottomed, inshore boat also often used as a ferry. It is long and heavy with a clumsy, almost homemade looking rudder. Its flag is probably the Hoorn ensign (also a city in North Holland, close to Texel). All the vessels tell something of life in Holland at the time, but this picture was painted around 1665, when Holland was in the middle of a bitter war with England. Hanging over the side and almost dipping into the water is a gold and white flag still on its pole. It’s placed with care and almost spotlit with a bright if mellow light. Behind it, among bundles of hay, is a cannon and a pair of cannon wheels. At least one of the men on board wears a gun belt.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like other marine artists of the time, van de Cappelle painted incidents, characters and objects that might be unfamiliar to a modern audience but which would have been understood instantly by a contemporary one. But perhaps more than anecdotal detail, the artist’s real concern was the painting of atmosphere, with quiet water and the abstract beauty of changing light on masts, ropes and sails.</p></div>

Flags droop or raise a faint flutter, and sails seem to reach up in vain for a breeze. But there’s a sense of drama in the picture, unusual for the artist. Grey clouds threaten and a fitful sun breaks through, making a single white furled sail gleam. The barge in the foreground on the right is rowed with some urgency, and a forest of sails and masts crowd together in the middle distance. A puff of smoke from a cannon reminds us that in seventeenth-century Holland ships were for war as well as trade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In these images, a single cannon firing a shot is usually a salute on board a naval vessel. In this case, the smoke comes from the yacht with its sails unfurled in a graceful curve. Perhaps it acknowledges the departure of the man seated at the back of the barge heading away from the larger vessel. This is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Statenjacht</span> (state yacht), an official vessel used for carrying members of the States General or members of the parliaments of the provincial states. The coat of arms on the stern isn’t readable and since uniforms weren’t worn in the navy at that time, we can’t be sure if it’s an admiralty craft or not. But the man in the barge has splendid feathers in his hat and shiny buttons aplenty on his chest, suggesting he has some rank and his visit has been of importance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the foreground on the left is a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pont</span>, a long, flat-bottomed craft used to ferry foot passengers. The ones here watch activities on the yacht or chat among themselves, while the two horses on board appear fascinated by their own reflections in the water. The sail of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pont</span> is almost furled, but there’s enough to pick up a little breeze and the passengers are seemingly content to travel along very slowly. The Dutch colours are wrapped around its pole in the stern, perhaps to keep it from trailing in the water, as the enormous flag on the barge does.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van de Cappelle was often inaccurate in his depictions of the many vessels he painted, seeing his pictures as harmonious compositions rather than an accurate record, unlike the leading Dutch marine artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Willem van de Velde the Younger</a>. But like all marine artists at the time van de Cappelle painted indoors, using both his sketches and his imagination to craft his marine views. Here, he has lengthened the masts of the boats – they appear even more elegant and stately than they would in reality. The clouds are dark and brooding, contrasting with rather than being reflected in the shimmering water below. He has successfully put the drama and mood of the composition first, leaving total realism to others.</p></div>

Cuyp was probably the most important of the artists to be influenced by their work. He transferred this distinctive light to his Dutch scenes, giving them the soft radiance you see here.</p></div>

The wide curve of the small boat that carries two fishermen is echoed in the sweeping downward curve of the high sand dune on the right, framing the scene between them. Tucked into the shelter of the dune, a herdsman squats on his haunches and one of his animals turns towards him with an enquiring gaze.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The depth of colour is at its richest in this corner of the picture, giving the cows weight and substance, and a warm graininess to the sand dune behind them. You can almost hear the faint splash of a hoof stamping in the water or the swish of a tail as the evening midges begin to bite. In a country greatly dependent on its cattle for its wealth, Cuyp has brought these magnificent beasts close to us, giving them as much character as – and much more significance than – the people around them. The evening is so still that the man in the central boat a little way off needs oars as well as a sail to propel him. A glint of sunlight catches the curve of the hull, sweeping on up the arc of the sail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Several Dutch artists who had been to Italy painted landscapes full of the soft light of the Mediterranean. Cuyp was probably the most important of the artists to be influenced by their work. He transferred this distinctive light to his Dutch scenes, giving them the soft radiance we see in this painting, and in the much larger, more ambitious <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EV8-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Distant View of Dordrecht, with a Milkmaid and Four Cows, and Other Figures (‘The Large Dort’)</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPF-0001-0000-0000.htm">River Landscape with Horseman and Peasants</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">English travellers to Holland in the seventeenth century remarked with surprise that butchers, bakers, blacksmiths and cobblers adorned their homes with pictures. John Evelyn, the famous diarist, was surprised at the amount of money that even ‘a common farmer’ paid for a picture. This small painting might once have hung on the walls of a mansion belonging to a wealthy collector, but it also might have been hung in a humbler house – one where its theme would have appealed to the owner in a more personal way.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Aelbert Cuyp did paint some stormy scenes, but the vast majority of his landscapes are, like this one, an evocation of rural tranquillity, the countryside bathed in the warm glow of a summer afternoon. We can feel it’s warm: the cowherd on the left has fallen asleep on the bank in the foreground, and the black and white dog next to him has a distinctly dozy air about it. The cattle too seem drowsy. Cuyp made a preliminary drawing for the sleeping boy on a signed sheet of studies (Rijksprentenkabinet, Amsterdam).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We‘re looking at a landscape in the Low Countries, probably the flatlands between Nijmegen and Cleves in the eastern part of the Netherlands, which Cuyp had visited in the early 1650s.

It was a combination which became fashionable in Holland during the seventeenth century, when Dutch artists who had trained and worked in Italy returned home to ply their trade. Cuyp never visited Italy, but he was certainly influenced by his contemporaries who had, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Both</a>. Cuyp made this lighting effect a trademark of his paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With the warm glow also comes a sense of harmony. Man and beast are living peacefully together, the animals dutifully subservient to their masters. The cowherd and horseman also seem to chat easily, even though one – the man riding the horse – is probably of a significantly higher social status. He might be the cattle farmer checking on his animals, or a passing gentleman.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Either way, our viewpoint from behind these figures draws us into the picture in two subtle ways. First, it invites us to follow their gaze over the landscape, out along the diagonal line established by the angle of the standing horse, the clouds and the two flocks of birds – a line which seems to emanate from the distant spire of the church. Secondly, we are left intrigued as to the subject of their discussion. Perhaps they are talking about something to the left of that diagonal, something just out of our sight. Or perhaps, like us, they are simply admiring the view.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cows, of course, are oblivious to all this – but they are important too. At the time they were highly valued as a key economic success story. They grazed happily on the damp reclaimed lowlands, and continuing improvements in breeding stock and feeding practice were increasing their productivity. Cheese and butter were not only national staples, but had become important exports. In short, cattle represented a reliable source of wealth and peaceful prosperity – and Cuyp was famous for his ability to depict them convincingly, often using positions and profiles that he would repeat and perfect in different paintings. For example, the arrangement of the heads of the two cows standing together side-on in this picture is a near mirror image of two heads in Cuyp’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EV8-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Distant View of Dordrecht, with a Milkmaid and Four Cows, and Other Figures (’The Large Dort')</a></span>. The outline of the cow standing head-on on the right is also used in both paintings, though varied slightly.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clear, soft light illuminates a peaceful landscape. Clouds seem to hover in the sky, the trees are still and faint haze drifts across the far side of the wide river. There’s not a breath of wind to disturb the calm waters or the perfect reflections of the towers and turrets of the distant town. There’s a sense that everything is in its place and all’s well with the world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cows look well fed and contented. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OYR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cuyp</a> has painted them in deep, rich, glossy colours, and we sense their weight and warmth as they bask in the sun, lazily surveying the aristocratic rider who pauses beside them. The sun catches the haunch of the white horse and the rider’s cloak, as well as the trunk of a silver birch tree and the enormous leaves at its base.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Further along the path, a woman with a long shepherd’s crook tends a flock of sheep, the animals jostling each other about on the rise of the riverbank. The woman and the child beside her turn their heads towards a man walking briskly towards them, while the rider’s attention is caught by a young lad. He seems to point anxiously towards something likely to disturb the tranquillity of the scene. Crouched in the bushes on the left and poised on the point of firing, a man aims his gun at the birds on the river. A shot would echo across the water, startling the animals and destroying the atmosphere. This gives a slight edge to the picture: rather than remaining a rustic idyll, almost too good to be true, the scene is brought into the real world.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The image is, in fact, definitely too good to be true – it’s an elegant, evocative construction drawn from the imagination. A print of the picture was once identified as ‘a view on the Maas at Dordrecht’, and while Cuyp did make sketches of views of that and other areas on his travels in the Netherlands and Germany, this particular view can’t be identified. The river in the painting is not the Maas. There are no mountains in Holland, the buildings might be from anywhere and the light is the pale gold of a Mediterranean morning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cuyp was probably the most important of the Dutch landscape artists who drew on the experience and style of those who had lived and worked in Rome for several years, like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Both</a>. While there, Both had known <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a>, and admired their images of pastoral idylls bathed in golden light, often a background for stories from classical myth or the Bible. Jan Both brought the ideas and techniques of these two artists back to Holland, where the resultant pictures proved popular with collectors (see, for instance, his large painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D93-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Landscape with the Judgement of Paris</a></span>). Other artists also brought back sketchbooks and drawings, which seem to have been shared between like-minded artists who painted in the Italianate style – even if, like Cuyp, they had never been to Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know who this picture was painted for, but it was probably intended to hang on the walls of one of the great mansions owned by wealthy and sometimes noble families in Holland at the time. Cuyp himself married into one of these families shortly after he painted this important landscape, when it appears he almost gave up painting altogether.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1764, the picture was brought into England and sold to a Scottish nobleman, the 3rd Marquess of Bute, a close friend of George III. It was placed in his collection at Luton Hoo, his large estate not far from London. Cuyp’s work was virtually unknown in Britain at the time and when an etching was made of the picture, the printmaker gave Cuyp’s first name as Adriaen, not Aelbert. A short while afterwards, John Boydell, a well-known publisher and printmaker, praised it as ‘entirely from nature, inexpressibly bright, clear and sunny: the choice of scene is elegant and picturesque’. This was the start of an upsurge of enthusiasm for Cuyp’s work in Britain. The great majority of his best pictures were imported between 1760 and 1840, and are still here, some in the kind of great house for which this painting was probably made.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cows often feature in pastoral landscapes, especially in seventeenth-century Dutch painting. But it is rare for them to be given quite such heroic status as the four monumental beasts which dominate the foreground here. They relegate the shepherd to the hill and the milkmaid, who funnels the results of her labour into a brass flask, to the sidelines. But for the artist and his contemporaries cows were extremely highly valued, and Cuyp was famous for his ability to paint such scenes of bovine bliss. He could make his cattle seem real: flesh out their bulk, make their heavy, horned heads hang with convincing languor, use the light to pick out the ripples on their flanks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is not only an excellent example of his skill, it is also one of the largest he ever made. We don’t know who commissioned it, but most of his customers were private buyers. If this was the case here, it must have been bought by someone whose house had rooms big enough to display it to effect. Cuyp had half a dozen such clients in his home town of Dordrecht, then one of the richest cities in the Netherlands. We can see the key landmarks of Dort (as it was known) in the distance. The imposing bulk of the Grote Kerk (‘Great Church’) dominates the hazy horizon. To the left is the high profile of the Vuilpoort watergate, while the suburbs seem to spill right out as far as the cottage in the middle of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as their impressive town houses, some Dordrecht families also had a country residence and held land outside the city where dairy farming was expanding. It may be that this picture represents an idealised view from such an estate. Cuyp himself had acquired lands through marriage, but they were to the west of Dordrecht and we can tell from the orientation of the church that the viewpoint here is from the south-east. This painting isn’t about grand houses, but it is concerned both with the interdependence between town and country and the importance of cattle to the local economy and the Dutch way of life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cows were a national success story. The seventeenth century had seen improvements in breeding stock, better feeding practice and the reclamation of flooded land – low-lying pasture was much better for cattle than sheep. Cheese and butter were not only national staples, they were now key exports. In short, cattle represented wealth, peaceful prosperity and plenty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We sense that happy state in this painting. The cows seem to have a presence in the landscape as permanent and solid as the church and windmills. Peasant and beast work side by side. Even the sheep dog, petted by a small child, stands quietly watching the flowing milk while the afternoon light floods in from the south west, suffusing the scene with a warm glow – a fashionable lighting effect which had recently come to Holland from Italy. To knit it all together, Cuyp reinforces this harmonious sense of peace and order with a subtle sequence of pictorial planes, from the immediate darkening foreground of weeds and brambles to the light-dappled cows, the shadowy cottages and windmills, then Dordrecht itself, bathed in sunshine. As well as deepening the perspective they form an intricate weave of light and dark. And then, beyond the city the overall mood is set by a luminous low-country sky, clouds fringed with silver, which takes up half of the canvas and glows in the evening light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is similar to another by Cuyp, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6X-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Distant View of Dordrecht, with a Sleeping Herdsman and Five Cows</a></span>.</p></div>

He often painted this view across the water to his home town of Dordrecht, which is defined by the large bulk of the Grote Kerk (Great Church). But normally in Cuyp’s paintings the scene is a calm one – the water is mirror-still and sails hang limp from the mast.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture, which is probably an early work, is very different. It is defined by the lightning which flashes across the sky above the town. Instead of a sense of timelessness, it captures an instant – the moment when the gleaming rooftops and the church tower in the background have been illuminated by the sudden blaze of light, while rain pours from a leaden sky. In the foreground, the clouds seem to be clearing and a burst of sunlight catches the spray thrown back over the bow of the boat nearest us. The churning waves are capped with foam and the sail is blown taught against the rigging. Oarsmen in a small boat heave against the choppy sea.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While freezing this moment of turmoil and violence, Cuyp nevertheless evokes a strong sense of the force of the storm. The horizon is set very low in the picture and emphasises the great dynamic sweep of sky with a series of strong diagonals: the lines of cloud, the clusters of birds, the shape of the lightning bolt and the angle of the ship’s mast and spas. The diagonals are countered by Cuyp’s energetic brush strokes – broad and swirling for the deep grey clouds, short and choppy for the sea. In the midst of this drama, there is a quiet stoicism. While nature rages around them, the sailors keep a low profile. Rather than wrestling with ropes they seem calm and controlled. If there is heroism here, it is the quiet heroism of endurance in the face of adversity. They are riding out the storm rather than battling against it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The three boats which are struggling against the squall are know as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">damloopers</span> (‘dam runners’) because they could be hauled over dams and dykes. They were slow, sturdy trading vessels with a shallow draft, built for Holland’s inland waters. Instead of a deep keel, they had leeboards on each side which were lowered individually to stabilise the boat. This is a very useful design in shallow waters, but makes for slower progress when tacking against the wind – as the boats are doing here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cuyp painted at least one other scene of a lightning flash at around the same time as this picture (Foundation E.G. Bührle Collection, Zurich). But it is very different, depicting a view of Dordrecht across a landscape grazed by cattle.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is very similar to but roughly half the size of another landscape by Aelbert Cuyp: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EV8-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Distant View of Dordrecht, with a Milkmaid and Four Cows, and Other Figures</a></span>.

Presumably one of Cuyp’s clients saw and liked one of the paintings, and asked him for a bigger or smaller version.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of Cuyp’s customers were wealthy merchants in his hometown of Dordrecht, and several of these had land and property in the countryside beyond; almost certainly they would have had an interest in dairy farming. Cows were a national success story. The seventeenth century had seen improvements in breeding stock, better feeding practice and increasing reclamation of flooded land – low-lying pasture was much better for cattle than sheep. Cheese and butter were not only national staples, they were now key exports. In short, cattle represented wealth, peaceful prosperity and plenty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We sense that happy state in this painting. The cows seem to have a presence in the landscape which is as permanent and solid as the church and windmills beyond. The mood is more soporific than in the larger version, however. The sky seems slightly less luminous, the sun is lower and more of the painting is in shadow. Three of the cows seem to be on the verge of sleep, while the herdsman and the dog have already dropped off. The day’s labour, it seems, is over. But a similar sense of ease and contentment prevails. And Cuyp has used the same subtle sequence of pictorial planes to knit together the composition, from the dark foreground of weeds and brambles to the light-dappled cows, the shadowy cottages and windmills, then Dordrecht itself, bathed in the evening light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He has also opened out the landscape slightly more towards the east, where the city suburbs encroach even more closely. The rickety patched-up fence – Cuyp has signed his name on the top rail – gives a slight sense of benign neglect. There is more emphasis on the cows in this version – no distracting milkmaids or children here. And, unlike <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EV8-0001-0000-0000.htm">the larger picture</a> where the cattle are kept almost entirely below the horizon, here the central standing animal hogs a good part of the skyline, obliterating most of the church nave in the distance. Cuyp has also added an extra cow to the composition – a black and white one. Perhaps this was just for effect and variation, or perhaps his client was experimenting with a new breed.</p></div>

The reflections in the still waters of the lake add to the impression that the stone towers and tumbledown ramparts are merging into their surroundings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One dissenting note suggests that there is still force and significance in the castle. The right-hand tower is intact, and the spire on its conical roof breaks through the line of the horizon and the wispy grey cloud above. It is a moment of strength and confidence, a reminder of the castle’s former glory.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This may have had some resonance to a contemporary audience who were likely to have recognised the castle. It is the castle of Ubbergen, near Nijmegen in the Dutch Province of Gelderland. The fourteenth-century building was ruined in 1582 during the Spanish occupation of the Netherlands and as such was seen as a symbol of national independence. This painting isn’t dated but was probably made in 1655, less than a decade after the Treaty of Münster (1648), when the Dutch finally won independence from Spain (an event depicted by Gerard ter Borch in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F00-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Swearing of the Oath of Ratification of the Treaty of Münster</a></span>). The castle no longer exists – it was finally pulled down in 1712 and replaced with a house.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The red coat of the shepherd and the mounted gentleman beside him catch our eye, and we might think that Cuyp is inviting us to imagine the conversation between the two. Maybe they are discussing the castle’s role in their national history, while the sheep and – in the distance – the cattle which graze peacefully on the shore of the lake seem to suggest more peaceful, plentiful times.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The cloud formations against the bright blue-gold of the sky seem to form a plume, emerging like smoke from a volcano – though this is probably accidental. The nearest live volcano to Dordrecht, where Cuyp lived and worked, is Mount Vesuvius, hundreds of miles to the south, and he never went there. However, he was heavily influenced by Dutch artists who did travel to Italy, usually to train and work in Rome. They returned to Holland with a penchant for using lighter, warmer colours and for painting sunny Mediterranean skies; Cuyp responded to this new Italianate style by developing the characteristic light of his own. Typically, it is reminiscent of the golden light of a late summer afternoon, though perhaps here there is a more autumnal feel than usual.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery has many landscapes by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Meindert Hobbema</a>, but none of them look quite like this. The vast majority of his paintings are either pictures of watermills or woodlands in which he typically used conventional ruses such as a winding track, a pond or a gap in the trees to add a sense of depth and lead our eye subtly into the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The visual devices in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Avenue at Middelharnis</span>, which is by far his most famous painting, are very different. As the artist David Hockney pointed out when talking about the picture in 2018: ‘what’s fascinating is that… there are two vanishing points. One is in the centre of the painting, with the disappearing road. But the other is in the sky. You’re always looking up, because the trees are so tall.’ A vanishing point is the theoretical spot where parallel lines, such as the sides of a road, appear to converge in the distance. Here, this illusion is emphasised by the avenue of trees set right in the middle of the picture. Hockney’s comment about a second point is something of an exaggeration; strictly speaking, there is no second spot in the sky where the vertical lines meet. But Hobbema has created a remarkable effect, using the trees to funnel our view directly into the heart of the picture and as strong verticals to take the eye upwards. Our gaze is also drawn sideways into the landscape, through the track that turns off to the right and the strong lateral lines of the paths and fields on the left. It’s as though there is a three-dimensional grid – an invisible geometry – underlying the whole painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The positioning of the figures enhances these effects. The head of the man in yellow walking towards us is precisely level with the horizon and only slightly to one side of the vanishing point: it’s another way of attracting our attention towards the distant town. He is looking directly at us, so we feel tempted to step forwards down the track to meet him, but he is also positioned exactly at the junction of the two main paths, introducing an element of uncertainty. He clearly intends to continue straight on, but his dog, which also gazes directly at us, seems to want to wander off on the other track, towards the courting couple on the right. They stand outside the frame of the trees, another distraction which frees our eye from the strictures of the avenue.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Hobbema’s radically new approach to painting a landscape came relatively late in his life. The vast majority of his works were produced before 1668, when he turned 30 and got a well-paid job with the wine-importers‘ association of Amsterdam. After this, he no longer made his living as an artist, and painted only occasionally. The present picture, made about 21 years after he changed professions, is one of only a handful which survives from this period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know whether he was commissioned to make it or was simply inspired by the view of this regimented landscape of straight lines. But <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Avenue at Middelharnis</span> was clearly composed after or during a visit to the spot. Middelharnis is on the north coast of the island of Over Flakee in southern Holland, and the view we see here is from the south-east. The road still exists – it is now called Steneweg, and is now almost entirely lined with houses – and as far as we can tell the painting is an accurate reflection of the view at the time. The fifteenth-century church (St Michael’s, now generally referred to as the Grote Kerk or the Reformed Church) still stands but the tower has been partly rebuilt and the spire with the bulbous top removed. Hobbema did not just copy the scene, however. X-ray images show that he had originally placed two other trees in the foreground, one on either side of the avenue, and subsequently painted them both out. He may have felt that the extra – and even taller – pair of trees put too much emphasis on the avenue, and took too much away from the views of the landscapes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The choice of an avenue as the subject of a painting was unusual for the time and has interesting resonances. They were an integral part of landscape design, both in parkland gardens and the approach roads to towns, grand houses and estates. Their decorative function is alluded to in the nursery gardens we can see on either side of the road. In the right foreground, a gardener is clipping a box tree – one of many which are being grown into the sort of ornamental shape that was popular in the highly regimented gardens of the elite in the seventeenth century. What seem to be more mature examples are being grown on the other side of the road. The trees which line the avenue also have a distinctive shape, but this is not for aesthetic reasons. They are alders, a species native to the Low Countries that flourishes in wet ground, such as riverbanks, the edges of a canal or the ditches in this picture. We don’t see trees looking like this today – the strange, spindly look has been caused by the now largely defunct process of ’shredding'. This method of managing trees involved regularly removing the side branches and brushwood for fuel and animal fodder, leaving the branches at the top so that the trunk could continue to grow straight and tall for future felling (alder was used to make scaffold poles, for example).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition proved to be a powerful influence on later artists – even David Hockney made his own version in 2017, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Tall Dutch Trees After Hobbema (Useful Knowledge)</span>. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Avenue at Middelharnis</span> was admired by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a>, who emulated its effects in several paintings after he first saw it in the National Gallery in 1884. It probably also inspired Camille Pissarro’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM2-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Avenue, Sydenham</a></span>, which he made while living in south London; the National Gallery had acquired the work a month before Pissarro left London in June 1871, and it is highly probable that he saw it when it first went on display.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This imaginary landscape in the flatlands of the Low Countries conjures a remarkably effective illusion of a vast panorama opening up before us. Koninck has used two particular techniques to create this effect. He’s made the figure in the middle ground the most prominent and painted the landscape around him in a more detailed way than the foreground and far distance. It’s an innovative technique, replicating the way our eyes work when we gaze into the distance – we focus on one point and the rest blurs slightly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Koninck has also taken a more conventional approach to creating a sense of space, depicting a series of ripple-like horizontals formed by the hedges, fields, patches of water and distant hills. They seem to form a series of low waves spreading out from the long flat horizon. There are no vertical lines to disrupt them or to frame the edges of the panorama.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A strong diagonal path leads from the bottom right of this painting into the middle distance. Standing in front of this large picture it almost feels as though you could clamber down onto it, stroll past the shepherd playing his pipe and follow on the heels of the walker towards the courting couple. When you look closely at these figures, however, you realise that they are not painted to scale. The man walking is further away from us than the shepherd, so should be smaller than him, not bigger. And the two figures a little further down the road are much smaller than they should be.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is hard to believe that a painter as skilled as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PN5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philips Koninck</a> would have made such basic errors of scale by mistake. Instead, what he seems to be doing is experimenting with optical effects, using a deliberate strategy to try to replicate the way our eyes work when we gaze into the distance. Because we can’t focus on an entire panorama at once the eye must either relax altogether, so that everything is slightly blurred, or focus on the detail at a certain point in the distance, so that some of what we see will be clear and the rest slightly fuzzy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as making the walking man in the middle ground more prominent so that he catches our eye, Koninck has painted the landscape around him in a more detailed way. At this distance, the leaves on the trees and shrubs, the sheep and the buildings are carefully articulated. In contrast, the foreground nearest us is suggested with broader brush strokes, as are the fields and buildings in the further distance. The blurring is especially noticeable on the top edge of the bank just below the middle figure. In a real view, there would be a sudden change in the depth of field at this point; if focusing beyond the bank, the top of it would inevitably blur into our peripheral vision.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s an innovative technique, but Koninck, who made many large paintings of extensive landscapes, also took a more conventional approach to creating a sense of the vast open space before us. Apart from that diagonal line in the foreground, little distracts the eye from the series of ripple-like horizontals formed by the hedges, fields, patches of water and distant hills. There are no vertical lines, and there is nothing to frame the edges of the panorama. Viewed from such a long, slanting angle, the horizontals seem to run towards us like a series of low waves spreading out from the long flat horizon. Meanwhile, from the same horizon, the clouds billow up towards us at a similar angle, though one which sweeps slightly across the picture from right to left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The location of this view has not been identified and, like many landscape paintings of the time, it may well be imaginary.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There’s an air of stillness in this large painting that is unusual in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob van Ruisdael</a>’s work. The clouds hang as if suspended over the forest and the leaves of the trees – often restless in his other pictures – are quiet, though by no means lifeless. Reflections tremble a little in the water, and although the woods seem dark and sombre, the colours in the picture are rich and lustrous.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The deep greens of the oaks that form a screen across the space are given life by the contrast of the gold leaves of the birch saplings growing out of the pool and the silvery bark of the dead tree on the right. Bushes push out of the shadows glowing with amber and gold, and nut-brown lichen grows on the fallen branch in the earthy water. A sudden view of stark, grey rock through the trees beyond the bank, where the clouds are at their heaviest, doesn‘t affect the tranquillity of the scene. Only the big white dog splashing through the shallows after the almost invisible hare does that – but it’ll soon be gone.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Also almost hidden are the two owners of the dog; they stand on the rise under the large oak, one above the other. One looks up at his companion and points at the dog with one arm. A single fleck of white paint suggests that there’s another dog at his feet, waiting its turn to run. The twisted shape of the oak’s trunk shows van Ruisdael’s fascination with nature’s many forms, but also his attention to detail in composition: the double ‘S’ bend of the tree serves to prevent the other vertical tree trunks from turning still to static. The little pond and its surroundings may be dark and perhaps a little melancholy, but there is still growth and fruitfulness and, with the occasional ripple, a suggestion of abundant life under the water. There are tiny, new reeds growing round the rotting tree trunk, and the pale spheres of waterlily buds sitting on their mossy green pads.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ruisdael was probably the greatest of the Dutch seventeenth-century landscape painters. Prolific and successful, his paintings were highly sought after during his lifetime and his popularity never waned. This painting was once in the large collection of the nineteenth-century prime minister, Sir Robert Peel. A companion described him turning his head to look at it and wrote that it was ‘as if its cool, dewy verdure, its deep seclusion, its transparent waters stealing through the glade had sent refreshment to his very soul’.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three small boats head up river, towards the rising sun. Their taut, curved sails are outlined against a cool, luminous sky as they lean with the wind. Moving clouds reveal a patch of intense blue that is reflected silvery grey on the translucent water below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PV7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Ruysdael</a>’s poetic vision of the three thrusting sails seems to turn the journey through a flat, prosaic Dutch landscape into an epic voyage, like those of the great merchant ships of the time. The boats are <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kaags</span>, small flat-bottomed vessels intended for inshore sailing. They often carried goods but were also sometimes used as ferryboats, as these are. People are packed in tightly on the three craft.  They are bundled up warmly against the chill but would have been well used to travelling on the water, the main means of transport in seventeenth-century Holland.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cattle wade up to their knees by the far bank, with a single white animal picked out in the growing light. Close to us, the corks of the dragnet held by a fisherman in a rowing boat midstream bob on the water. The curving net is attached to the side of the vessel beached on the grassy slip of land on the right; van Ruysdael’s signature is just discernible on one of its wooden slats. Its lone fisherman is surrounded by huge woven containers ready to take their catch. One basket already floats in the river to keep the fish alive and cool when the sun reaches full height.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Deventer is quite a way from the sea, the River Ijssel is wide here. Seen through the early morning mist, the city’s buildings are hazy. A close look reveals that they are painted in some detail, but van Ruysdael has painted them in positions slightly different to those they occupy in reality for the sake of the rhythmic flow of the composition. Among the windmills on the left is the sturdy round tower of the Noordenbergtoren; to the right is the high, triple-tiered tower of the Grote Kerk. Between them, but a little further away, are the twin spires of the Bergh Kerk. Distant white sails cluster at the entrance to the Vischpoorte, where fishing boats once unloaded their catch for market.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ruysdael was one of a group of Dutch artists who, in the early seventeenth century, pioneered the painting of naturalistic scenes with vast skies; like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QE0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Goyen</a> and others, he restricted his palette to a range of greens, greys and blues. They depicted what they saw but, at the same time, captured the essence of the Dutch landscape. Van Ruysdael painted mostly river scenes like this one and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUO-0001-0000-0000.htm">A River with Fishermen drawing a Net</a></span>, while van Goyen ventured further, depicting scenes at the coast, like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EW5-0001-0000-0000.htm">An Estuary with Fishing Boats and Two Frigates</a></span>.</p></div>

To soften the harsh outline further, van de Velde has covered the lower branches with shaggy ivy. High up, an old rook’s nest is balanced, somewhat precariously, in a crook. Beside the tree, the new shoots of a pair of willows fan out softly from elegantly curved trunks. Beneath it, spikes thrust up from the heap of sticks echo the twigs left on the crooked branches. They're likely to have been cut from it as kindling – nothing was left to waste on a well-run seventeenth-century Dutch farm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van de Velde painted the picture when he was only 22 years old and it shows remarkable maturity for one so young. The three distinct groups of animals and figures, each a satisfying vignette on its own, are bound together by the wide pool of warm sunlight. The brilliant blue of the milkmaid’s skirt enlivens the mellow browns, creams and greys of the foreground and harmonises with the blue of the sky.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the time the picture was painted, van de Velde was influenced by the animal painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paulus Potter</a>, whose images of statuesque cattle, particularly bulls, were popular in Holland. Van de Velde silhouettes the horns on his grey bull, drawing attention to its strength and substance, as Potter does in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CW2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cattle and Sheep in a Stormy Landscape</a></span>, in which he silhouettes the black bull’s horns against a break in the storm clouds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his early career, van de Velde worked in the studio of his father, Willem van de Velde the Elder, alongside his elder brother, Willem van de Velde the Younger – both of them marine artists of great reputation. But Adriaen chose to become a landscape painter rather than follow their path, although he frequently collaborated with his elder brother, painting the figures in some of his works – as he did in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Shore at Scheveningen</a></span>.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The merchant ships we see here are in some peril. The wind is so strong that they have been forced to take down their sails and are drifting at the mercy of the gale and the surging sea. They have little control over direction and all three must be towing sea anchors, a sort of underwater parachute, to slow themselves down and reduce the risk of being blown onto rocks or into shallow water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Our attention is focused on the nearest ship, a man-of-war, as it ploughs into a breaking wave. A sudden shaft of sunlight seems to highlight the moment – a flash of brilliant white foam against the deep grey of a looming storm cloud. But this vessel is faring well compared with the ship in the middle ground, which appears to have lost two of its masts. Its bowsprit has snapped in half, while the crew is battling to secure one of the yard arms lying across the foredeck. The mainsails of a third ship, which is just discernible in the near distance, have been let fly, the crew apparently unable to bring them in safely in such extreme conditions. There is nothing to be done with them now: they will soon be shredded by the force of the wind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Willem van de Velde</a> was careful to depict these details accurately. Holland was a powerful trading nation which depended on its merchant fleet and powerful navy for its prosperity and security, and on the inland seas, estuaries, rivers and canals for its domestic transport network. So most of his clientele would have been familiar the maritime world. Here, the configuration of the hull and masts, and even the finer points of the rigging – some of which is flailing wildly in the wind – are correctly rendered. It is often possible, through the flags and the design of the hull, to identify the nationality or point of origin of the vessels in van der Velde’s pictures. Here the red pennants with a white device in the centre at the mastheads of the nearest ship are probably the flag of Flushing. The vessel just behind flies a tattered Dutch flag at the top of the foremast, suggesting that it carries the vice-admiral (second in command) of a merchant fleet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When van de Velde painted this picture he had just moved from Amsterdam to England, another maritime nation with a powerful navy and merchant fleet. He appears to have had no problem selling pictures of Dutch ships on the London market, even though there were three major sea battles between the Dutch and the allied navies of the British and French in 1673, the year in which this picture was made. Ironically, it seems likely that van de Velde was at sea on the English side during the first two of these battles. His father, a painter of the same name who was also well known for his maritime scenes, certainly was. He made several drawings during these voyages, and his son seems to have used two of them (both in the National Maritime Museum, Greenwich) to help with this composition.</p></div>
