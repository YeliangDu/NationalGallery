        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of Bronzino’s most complex and enigmatic paintings. It contains a tangle of moral messages, presented in a sexually explicit image. Venus, goddess of love, steals an arrow from her son Cupid’s quiver as she kisses him on the lips. Cupid fondles Venus‘ breast, his bare buttocks provocatively thrust out as he returns her kiss and attempts to steal her crown.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The masks at Venus’ feet suggest that she and Cupid exploit lust to mask deception. The howling figure on the left may be Jealousy; the boy scattering roses and stepping on a thorn could be Folly or Pleasure; the hybrid creature with the face of a girl, Fraud or Deceit. Winged Father Time battles with mask-like Oblivion to either reveal or conceal the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was probably sent to King Francis I of France as a gift from Cosimo I de' Medici, ruler of Florence, who employed Bronzino as a court painter.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P30-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bronzino</a>’s most complex and enigmatic paintings. Its intended meaning is not entirely certain. It is likely to be the painting mentioned in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a>’s ‘Life of Bronzino’ of 1568: ‘He made a picture of singular beauty, which was sent to King Francis in France; in which was a nude Venus with Cupid kissing her, and on one side Pleasure and Play with other Loves; and on the other, Fraud, Jealousy, and other passions of love.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The erotic yet erudite subject matter of the painting was well suited to the tastes of King Francis I of France, who was notoriously lecherous. It was probably sent to him as a gift from Cosimo I de‘ <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, ruler of Florence, who employed Bronzino as a court painter. However, there appears to be no record of the painting ever having been in the French royal collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture contains a tangle of moral messages, presented in a sexually explicit image. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, goddess of love, steals an arrow from her son <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>’s quiver as she kisses him on the lips. Bronzino may have recalled a painting by his teacher <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pontormo</a> showing Venus robbing Cupid of his arrow (Uffizi, Florence), which was based on a drawing by  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>. Venus holds the golden apple which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET1-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paris</a> presented to her as the most beautiful of all goddesses, and her traditional attribute of a pair of doves rest on the ground. Cupid squats with his bare buttocks provocatively thrust out and fondles Venus’ breast, squeezing her nipple as he returns her kiss, while attempting to steal her crown. The masks at Venus‘ feet suggest that she and Cupid exploit lust to mask deception.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The smiling little boy with the anklet of bells is foolish Pleasure, who is about to shower the pair with rose petals. He doesn’t seem to notice the thorn piercing his right foot – Pleasure is frequently followed by Pain. Fraud or Deceit, the pretty girl behind Pleasure, offers Cupid a honeycomb. However, her concealed serpent’s body suggests that her offer of sweetness literally has a sting in its tail. The mantle pinned with a brooch to her shoulder is of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cangiante</span> colours that resemble shot silk – from one angle it appears pink, from another pale blue – as changeable and deceptive as she is.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the background is winged Father Time, identified by his hourglass. It is not easy to make out what he is doing. He holds a blue cloth with which he attempts either to conceal or reveal this series of deceits. He glares towards another figure in the background whose head appears to have no back or contents and who may represent Oblivion, also holding the cloth. Time may be attempting to stop Oblivion from concealing Venus and Cupid’s actions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure clutching their head behind Cupid has been variously identified as Suffering, Jealously and Syphilis, displaying some of the symptoms of the disease. However, such an overt reference to syphilis would have been inappropriate in a painting for the French king – the illness was known at the time as ‘the French disease’ because it was believed to have been brought to Italy by French troops. The painting’s message may have been about Beauty curbing Passion to protect us from Jealousy, Fraud and Folly, and enabling Time to combat the Oblivion that Passion entails. Equally it may be about the painful consequences of unchaste love, presided over by pleasure and deceit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If the painting was a diplomatic gift, then it is also possible that it has a political meaning. A famous drawing depicting the adultery of Mars and Venus (now in the Louvre, Paris), which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q71-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rosso Fiorentino</a> sent to the French king in 1530, is thought to celebrate the king giving up his war-like ambitions in Italy. Bronzino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Allegory</span> perhaps had a similar intention. There are indications that he may have had to make it quickly as there are, for him, an unusually large number of instances where he made alterations to outlines and changed his mind during painting. The figure tearing their hair was originally lower down, and Venus‘ arm was bent further back caressing Cupid’s curls.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These types of complex, multilayered themes are found in poetry of the period, and Bronzino, like Michelangelo, was an accomplished poet as well as a painter. He wrote conventional love lyrics derived from the poetry of Petrarch as well as more bawdy poems. Unravelling the painting’s meaning would have been part of its appeal – a pleasure to both the eye and the intellect – a duality frequently referred to in Bronzino’s poetry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The obscure imagery and highly artificial design and finish of the painting are characteristic of the type of highly sophisticated and self-consciously stylised art produced in European courts and urban centres at the time. Reacting against the ideals of harmony, proportion and naturalism of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">High Renaissance</a> art, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mannerist</a> art emphasised intellectual sophistication, unnatural elegance, artifice and instability. Bronzino and his teacher Pontormo embraced this artistic development, and Bronzino’s highly finished artificial and intellectual works – especially the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Allegory</span> – epitomise this erudite, courtly type of art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Allegory</span> has an almost enamel-like surface – the painter’s brushstrokes have been blended away to conceal the means by which the painting was made. Bright white artificial lighting defines marble-like limbs that are clearly outlined and unambiguously drawn. Every detail, animate or inanimate, is subjected to glaring scrutiny in this unflinching light, creating a sense of dramatically heightened artificiality. The painting has the structure and quality of a relief sculpture, with multiple figures, little depth and no real background, giving it a claustrophobic feeling. With its clear jewel-like colour and the abundant use of ultramarine blue, made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Allegory</span> has the appearance of a luxury object – as flawless, cold and hard as the golden ball in Venus’ hand.</p></div>

In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lives of the Artists</span>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a> described ’two large pictures of Our Lady with other figures, beautiful to behold, and carried out with infinite diligence‘ that Bronzino painted for Bartolomeo Panciatichi. The first of these, which includes a flag of the Panciatichi arms, is in the Uffizi, Florence, as is a portrait of Panciatichi by Bronzino. It has been suggested that the National Gallery’s painting may be the other Madonna painted for Panciatichi, although it is not of the same very high quality as the Uffizi picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The rocky background provides little sense of depth, making the figures seem very close to the picture’s surface, like a relief sculpture. In 1546, Benedetto Varchi, a Florentine intellectual, asked the leading artists of his time about the relative merits of the arts of painting and sculpture – a debate known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">paragone</span>. Although defending painting, Bronzino’s unfinished reply shows that he was particularly interested in sculpture. He claimed that painting was the finest of the arts because it could both evoke the three-dimensional qualities of sculpture and imitate nature in a way that sculpture could not. The ’sculptural’ style of painting that Bronzino favoured is evident here in the figures, the clearly outlined forms and the cool, flawless quality of his brushwork.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1914 it was noted that the remains of a signature were still visible. It read ‘B.ONZO FL..ETINO’, which stood for ‘Bronzino Florentino’, meaning Bronzino from Florence.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This unfinished painting shows Christ’s body being carried to his tomb in the rocks behind him. It is one of only three known surviving panel paintings by the great Florentine artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a> – the others are <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FWK-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saint John and Angels (‘The Manchester Madonna’)</a></span> and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Doni Tondo</span> (Uffizi, Florence).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1500 Michelangelo was commissioned to paint an altarpiece for the funerary chapel of Giovanni da Viterbo, the deceased bishop of Crotone, in the church of S. Agostino, Rome. Although the subject of the altarpiece is not documented, it is likely that this was the commissioned painting. The chapel was dedicated to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8B-0008-0000-0000.htm">pietà</a>, and the Entombment would have been an appropriate subject. The lighting in Michelangelo’s painting is from the left, which accords with the natural lighting of the chapel, and the picture’s measurements would have fitted the width of the chapel bays.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, the altarpiece was left unfinished when Michelangelo returned to Florence the following year, probably to procure for himself the great block of marble being offered by the authorities of Florence Cathedral, intended for a statue of David – a statue for which he signed the contract in August 1501 and which he would complete in 1504 to his everlasting fame (Accademia, Florence). He would not return to Rome until 1506 and returned the advance payment for the altarpiece to the friars of S. Agostino when he failed to deliver it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is some disagreement over the identity of the various figures in the painting. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a> is usually shown in red with long hair, and may be the figure on the left carrying <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. The woman who strains with Saint John to carry Christ’s body on the strips of winding cloth in which it will eventually be bound is one of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUN-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Marys</a>, probably Mary Cleophas, who looked after Christ at the end of his life. They carry him up a staircase to his tomb.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man who lifts Christ from behind is either <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EC7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph of Arimathea</a>, who donated his own burial place for Christ, or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nicodemus</a>, who helped lower Christ’s body from the Cross and prepare it for burial. Another of the Three Marys, possibly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>, sits on the ground. A drawing for this figure (Louvre, Paris) shows that she was intended to be gazing sorrowfully at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKD-0008-0000-0000.htm">crown of thorns</a> and the nails with which Christ had been crucified.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The space left empty on the right was probably intended for the kneeling figure of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. Michelangelo would have needed ultramarine blue made from the semi-precious stone lapis lazuli to complete the missing figure of the Virgin, as her mantle is traditionally painted this colour. The requisite ultramarine is also missing from Michelangelo’s unfinished <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FWK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manchester Madonna</a></span>. It may be that he was waiting until the last moment before adding this colour as it was the most expensive pigment and possibly difficult to obtain. A late seventeenth- or early eighteenth-century drawing, made of the painting when it was less worn (Biblioteca Comunale degli Intronati, Siena), indicates that the Virgin was to be shown kneeling with her back to the viewer, probably with hands joined in prayer, gazing at the corpse of her son. The other female figure on the right is another of the Three Marys, perhaps Mary Salome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Entombment</span> reflects Michelangelo’s belief that painting is better the closer it is to sculpture. The picture is almost a high relief sculpture transposed into paint – the figures are arranged in a bold rhythmic composition and there is little space between them. The focus is on the naked body of Christ, which is shown as perfect and beautiful – God made into man (curiously, Michelangelo never painted his genitals). The twisting movements and defined muscles of Michelangelo’s figures are based on his direct observation and drawing of live models.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">More traditional depictions of the Entombment show Christ’s body carried horizontally, but Michelangelo shows it lifted vertically and held up to the viewer as if it were the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>. This arrangement is similar to that used by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Angelico</a> in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Dead Christ before the Tomb</span> of about 1438–40, from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of the high altarpiece in S. Marco in Florence. The church was only a few steps from the sculpture garden at S. Marco where Michelangelo learnt to sculpt. This vertical pose also appears in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Dead Christ before the Tomb</span> (now in Badia a Settimo) by the workshop of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5W-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenico Ghirlandaio</a>, where the young Michelangelo trained as a painter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If Michaelangelo’s painting had been installed as an altarpiece, the priest would have stood in front of it and lifted up the sacrament – the bread – during the Eucharist, so it became the body of Christ silhouetted against his perfect painted body. Christ’s upright position also seems to allude to his imminent resurrection. The startlingly nude body is weightless and pristine with no sign of suffering, perhaps referring to the immaculate resurrected and heavenly body described in the First Epistle to the Corinthians (15: 35–49). In this way the picture is both devotional, inviting Eucharistic contemplation of the dead Christ, and narrative, showing his body being removed from our sight – in a few minutes he will be gone.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like the also unfinished <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FWK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Manchester Madonna</a></span>, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Entombment</span> offers a fascinating insight into Michelangelo’s working methods. While the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span> is painted in egg <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">tempera</a> on panel, this picture is painted in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oils</a>, revealing Michelangelo’s unusual approach to the medium. Michelangelo painted each figure in full before moving on to the next, as though he were painting in tempera, a technique that he had learned in Ghirlandaio’s studio. As in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span>, some colour areas were left entirely untouched whereas others are near to completion. This approach is not often seen in oil painting of this date in Italy – for example, in oil paintings left unfinished by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>, we find the whole composition worked up evenly and each colour area left in a similar state of incompleteness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Instead of creating relief by building up transparent glazes over an opaque underlayer of paint, as was the oil painting technique used in Venice and the Netherlands, Michelangelo modelled his forms by blending his shades into one another while they were still wet. As with his tempera technique, which also creates an opaque effect, Michelangelo added white to create a tonal range and used glazes only for the deepest shadows or specific colour effects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the top right he scraped away the dark paint of the rock to suggest the two figures moving back the stone that closes the tomb, removing material just as he did when sculpting in marble. He employed a similar technique of scraping away the paint when working on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Manchester Madonna</span>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TWL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pope Julius II</a> (1443–1513) is usually dated to the one-and-a-half-year period during which he wore a beard. He grew it as a token of mortification between October and December 1510 while recovering from a serious illness brought on by the loss of Bologna to French troops, and vowed to remain unshaven until the French were chased out of Italy. He removed his beard only when events took a turn for the better in March 1512.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that the portrait was painted very shortly after the Pope returned from his military campaign in Emilia-Romagna on 27 June 1511. His careworn expression may be explained by his continuing precarious state of health. In August 1511 he was struck by a second near-fatal illness, during which he received his Last Rites.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two golden acorns on the chair allude to his family name, della Rovere (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">rovere</span> is Italian for oak). The reflections in their gleaming surface reveal that Julius was seated opposite a doorway in a narrow room lit by a mullioned window. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> may have painted the portrait in Julius’s apartment on the third floor of the Vatican palace – perhaps the room where he received visitors, which was lit by similar windows. The portrait was displayed on 12 December 1513, after Julius’s death, in the Roman church of Santa Maria del Popolo, which had been redecorated at the expense of the della Rovere family.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Before Raphael covered it with the plain green colour visible today, the background was decorated with heraldic symbols representing the papal tiara, papal crossed keys and another symbol which was probably the yellow oak tree of the della Rovere coat of arms. The design would have looked very busy, with the yellow, blue and white pattern distracting from the extraordinary portrayal of the aged Pope deep in thought. Raphael’s decision to replace it with a green background may have been prompted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0RL3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Justus of Ghent</a>’s portrait of Julius’s uncle, Pope Sixtus IV, which shows a pope with a green damask curtain behind him. Raphael would have known the portrait from the ducal palace in his hometown of Urbino, where his father had been court painter. The colours red, white and green – repeated in the stones on the sitter’s finger rings – are also those of the three theological virtues: charity, faith and hope.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael’s portrait was enormously influential and became the model for ecclesiastical portraiture over the following 200 years. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sebastiano</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">El Greco</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Velázquez</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reni</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guercino</a> are among the many artists who adopted this formula. The three-quarter length format brings the viewer very close to the elderly, war-like Pope, who, when asked if he wanted to be shown with a book in his hand in a sculpture by Michelangelo, replied: ‘Give me a sword; I am not a man of letters.’ Raphael’s portrait, however, is not the portrait of a warmonger but an astonishingly intimate image of a careworn elderly man. Pope Julius was a great patron of the arts, commissioning Raphael to decorate the papal apartments (Vatican Stanze) and ordering the rebuilding of St Peter’s in Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery’s painting is very close to the portrait in Raphael’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> of Julius as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Gregory IX approving the Decretals</span> for the Stanza della Segnatura in the Vatican, which was completed by August 1511. The heads in the easel portrait and the fresco match each other line for line – it seems likely that Raphael made the easel portrait first, studying his model from life.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Only a small number of portraits by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea del Sarto</a> survive. This is one of his masterpieces. It was painted at a time when he was the leading painter in Florence, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a> all having left the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young man sits in a chair reading a book with his back to us. We have interrupted him and he turns to look over his shoulder at us. The turning pose and unguarded look create the sense that we are seeing him as he really is. This gives the portrait a feeling of immediacy and produces a convincing impression of the sitter’s psychology. He is shown reading, which suggests that he has an interest in books, and his costume is that of a Florentine craftsman.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">His elbow rests on the arm of the chair and partly projects into our space, creating a strong diagonal running from the top right to bottom left of the composition. The voluminous blue sleeve has a very convincing sense of sculptural form and is the pivotal point around which the turning pose rotates. Sarto probably made detailed studies from life for it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three red chalk drawings of different poses in the Uffizi, Florence, may have been made in preparation for this portrait. The drawings reveal that Sarto drastically revised his ideas before he finally came up with this pose. The man’s projecting elbow seems to have been a constant idea; the decision to position him looking back over his shoulder only arrived at later.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Daylight falls on the young man as if from a high narrow window to our left. Light is very important in this portrait as it is the means by which form is defined and atmosphere created. Light defines the shape of the man’s skull under the dark hat and adds bulk to his sleeve. It is a soft clear light, brilliant on the pleats of his fine white shirt, which reflects the light up to define the curve of his jaw, the cleft in his chin, the shapely line of his nose and the twist of his neck. His eyes smoulder in their dark sockets and we have the sense that this is only a momentary glance before he turns away from us again to resume his reading.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are not certain of the man’s identity. The painting was first documented as belonging to the Puccini family – in 1821 and 1832 it was recorded at their palace in Pistoia. Giovan Battista Puccini was one of Andrea del Sarto’s patrons, but he would have been in his mid-fifties by 1517 when this picture was painted, so it is unlikely that the portrait is of him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The hands and the book are less finished than the rest of the portrait and hard to decipher, which has led some people to believe he is actually a sculptor holding a block of cut stone. It has also been suggested that the sitter is Paolo da Terrarossa, another patron of Andrea del Sarto, whose family was involved in the production of bricks. However, the object held by the sitter is definitely not a brick, and the Uffizi drawings clearly demonstrate that the young man was intended from the start to be holding a book. When the portrait was bought by the National Gallery in 1862, the director believed it to be a self portrait, although there is no evidence to support this identification either. It is more likely that the sitter is the stationer Lorenzo di Matteo Peri (1490 – about 1527), whose family commissioned Andrea del Sarto’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dispute on the Trinity</span> (Galleria Palatina, Florence) in 1517–18 for their altar in the church of S. Jacopo tra Fossi in Florence. The sitter of the National Gallery portrait closely resembles <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter Martyr</a> in the altarpiece and it is likely that the individual from the Peri family who commissioned the altarpiece was portrayed twice by Andrea del Sarto during the same period.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The spiral fluidity of the pose in the portrait is derived from Leonardo’s work, as is the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sfumato</span> – the smoky, atmospheric effect. The limited palette of colours is very subtle, relying on pale greys, blue-lilac, black, white and brown. The restriction of colour and dramatic lighting adds the the intensity of the portrait.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although Sarto was trained in Florence and worked there, the way he has used <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> here is more akin to Venetian painters – he has modelled form in melting colour and light rather than in tones of black and white. His interest in effects of colour and atmosphere, as well as the informal pose and the natural expression of emotion, set him apart from Florentine painters of his time. The pose may have been inspired by Venetian examples – Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DCU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Gerolamo Barbarigo</a></span> of about 1510 shows the sitter glancing over his shoulder, with a similar projecting voluminous blue sleeve against a plain grey background. Where Titian has marked his initials ‘TV’ in the stone parapet, Andrea (whose real name was Andrea d‘Agnolo) has marked his intertwined ’AA‘ on the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pared-back composition, limited colour palette, sense of an interrupted moment and of psychological intensity seen here were to be developed further in portraits by the next generation of painters, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q7M-0001-0000-0000.htm">Moroni</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of the sculptor Alessandro Vittoria</span> of 1552–3 (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna) and his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F9F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tailor</a></span> of 1565–70. Although Andrea del Sarto was celebrated during his lifetime as a ’faultless painter', his fame was eclipsed after his death by that of Leonardo, Michelangelo and Raphael. He was particularly influential in training younger Florentine painters, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4K-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacopo Pontormo</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q71-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rosso Fiorentino</a> and Francesco Salviati.</p></div>

There is another copy of the Hermitage picture in the Royal Collection, Windsor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin’s hands support her son’s back and rest on his leg in a very natural way, as though Sarto has observed and drawn from a real mother and child. The infant John the Baptist nestles beneath his mother’s protective arm and leans against her raised knee. He is pointing to something but it is not clear what that is. His reed cross and scroll inscribed ‘Ecce Agnus Dei’ (‘Behold the Lamb of God’) lie on the ground at his feet. They remind the viewer of Christ’s future <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a> and sacrifice for humanity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of picture in which the Virgin is surrounded by saints is known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FXQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">sacra conversazione</a></span>. The gestures and interconnected glances suggest a psychological exchange.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The oval face of the Virgin with her small round dark eyes is a recognisable trait of Andrea del Sarto’s figures, and may be based on the features of his wife, Lucrezia del Fede. Sculptural draperies with angular folds, seen here in Saint Elizabeth’s robes, are also typical of his work, and are evident in the voluminous blue sleeve of his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Young Man</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are many pentimenti – instances where the artist changed his mind during painting – suggesting that this is an original work by Sarto, possibly with studio assistance in less important areas such as the landscape. The dark lines of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> can also be seen through the paint in some parts, particularly the flesh. Some of the changes altered the picture so that in its final form it was more like the ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Tallard Madonna</span>’, suggesting that the National Gallery’s picture may have been made first.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>The sitter's assured stance, proud gaze and magnificent costume suggest that she was a prominent figure of her time.<br/><br/> In the pieces of cloth she holds out is concealed a Latin inscription warning the viewer of the risks of love: 'Sunt Laquei Veneris Cave' ('These are the snares of Venus: beware'). These words may be an allusion to Venus' magic girdle, which had the effect of making its wearer irresistibly desirable and was borrowed by Juno to seduce Jupiter. The inscription refers more broadly to the power of love to capture and enslave its victim.<br/><br/> This portrait, admired for its compelling subject and superb quality, may date from the last seven years of the artist's life. The style of the costume, and particularly the head-dress, evoke the fashion of the 1540s. <br/><br/> In this painting Sebastiano returned to the three-quarter length format of his earlier works, which confers to the figure a strong sense of monumentality. Although the identity of the sitter is uncertain, various names have been suggested, such as the countess Giulia Gonzaga, famed throughout Italy for her intellect and beauty.</p></div>

The National Gallery’s painting is dated 1517 on the arm of the Virgin’s seat. There is a red chalk drawing by Michelangelo of the Virgin and Child (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) in a similar pose to the one shown here, and it may be the drawing that Michelangelo supplied to Sebastiano.</p></div>

Technical examination of the panel has revealed that it was extended to the right by about 10–11 cm, changing it from a portrait format to a landscape one, which was a more common arrangement for Venetian paintings of the holy family with a donor. Sebastiano may have originally intended the painting only to include the Virgin, Christ Child and donor. The diagonals in the composition draw the viewer’s eye to Christ gaze, which is directed back at the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The donor is likely Pierfrancesco <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Borgherini</a>, a wealthy Florentine merchant who was a friend to both <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sebastiano del Piombo</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>. Sebastiano and Michelangelo were commissioned by Borgherini to decorate a chapel in the church of S. Pietro in Montorio in Rome in 1516. Executed partly to Michelangelo’s designs by Sebastiano, the scene of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Transfiguration</span> in the half-dome above the altar includes an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a>, Saint James, who looks like the donor in the present picture. Another portrait by Sebastiano, today in the San Diego Museum of Art, appears to show the same man.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The present donor portrait was probably recorded from life rather than copied from a drawing, likely before the rest of the composition was painted. An <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared</a> image of the painting reveals that Sebastiano brushed in dark paint around the profile to make it stand out better from the brown-grey priming on the canvas, before later painting over this area. The ends of the brushstrokes of this dark paint are free, tapering off randomly as if Sebastiano had no clear plan for the rest of the picture at that time. It is possible that Sebastiano had to fit in a sitting with the busy donor at a very early stage in the development of the composition and probably painted the portrait directly from life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1517, Leonardo Sellaio (one of Michelangelo’s trusted friends) wrote to Michelangelo asking him to send Sebastiano a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartoon</a> for a Virgin and Child with Saint John the Baptist. Pierfrancesco Borgherini had commissioned a painting of the subject from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea del Sarto</a>, but he was not happy with it. Sebastiano offered to paint a replacement, and he was sure it would be good if he had a drawing by Michelangelo to work from. This may be that picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Infrared reflectography has revealed the date 1517 and the letter ‘S’ on the Virgin’s seat, below Christ’s foot, on the National Gallery’s painting, which suggests it may relate to this letter. There is a red chalk drawing by Michelangelo of the Virgin and Child (Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam) in which the infant Christ is in a similar pose to the one seen here; it may be the one that Michelangelo supplied to Sebastiano, although it is a quick sketch rather than the more finished cartoon requested. If Sebastiano originally only intended to include the Virgin, Child and donor, as technical examination of the painting suggests, then that brings its composition even closer in terms of format to Michelangelo’s drawing. The painting shows no sign of having been transferred from a cartoon. Instead, infrared reflectography reveals that the composition developed in an ad hoc manner more in keeping with Sebastiano’s Venetian manner of working than the more disciplined Florentine approach. This suggests that he did not receive a full-sized cartoon from Michelangelo as he had requested and had done for the earlier <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Pietà</span> (Museo Civico, Viterbo). The small sketch in red chalk would almost certainly have been Michelangelo’s only contribution to this work.</p></div>

The resurrected Lazarus stares in wide-eyed shock at his saviour, while a kneeling man helps him remove the shroud and bindings in which he had been buried. Mary kneels at Christ’s feet in awe. Martha, who had just reprimanded Christ for arriving too late to heal her brother, raises her hands. She averts her gaze, perhaps in awe and perhaps partly in shame at having doubted Christ’s ability to help her dead brother, for which he reprimanded her with the words, ‘I am the Resurrection and the Life. Anyone who believes in me will live, even after dying.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a> at bottom left falls to his knees, while other <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> turn to one another in amazement. Three women cover their noses against the smells from the opened grave. A crowd surges along both banks of the river from the distant town to observe the miracle for themselves. Faces are varied – young and old, dark and fair, male and female – and display a wide variety of reactions to the miracle, encouraging the viewer to share in their emotions and arrive at their own interpretation of what is happening.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting brings together more than 40 characters in a dense and complex composition. The basic arrangement is derived from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>’s treatment of the subject in the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua. Giotto’s Tuscan masterwork was painted in the Veneto, and Sebastiano’s painting combines elements of Florentine and Venetian artistic traditions. The graphic, linear design of the figures owes a great deal to Florentine examples, but the way it is painted is more typical of Venetian art, with the design drawn freehand onto the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> with a brush and, in places, with substantial revisions made during painting. It is a bravura display of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> technique, interweaving a remarkable range of bright colours across the surface. Sebastiano’s approach, creating subtle variation in hue and depth through the use of oil glazes, is typically Venetian. However, his high-key colour range and use of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cangiante</span> colours – sharp gradations of colour to resemble shot silk – are the direct result of his admiration for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>’s bold, unnaturalistic colouring on the Sistine Ceiling in Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Raising of Lazarus</span> was commissioned by Cardinal Giulio de‘ <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a> (1478–1534), probably in late 1516, as an altarpiece for Narbonne Cathedral in southern France, where he had just become bishop. Lazarus was especially venerated and was believed to have preached there. Around the same time, Giulio commissioned <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> to paint another altarpiece for the same destination – <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Transfiguration</span> (now in the Vatican Museums, Vatican City). The pairing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Transfiguration</a> and the raising of Lazarus was a tradition stretching back to medieval times.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The rivalry between Raphael and frequent collaborators Sebastiano and Michelangelo was fierce. In a letter dated 19 January 1517, Michelangelo’s friend and assistant Leonardo Sellaio wrote to the artist in Florence that Sebastiano feared Raphael would do everything in his power to prevent him from finishing the painting so it couldn’t be compared to his own work. In January 1518 Michelangelo briefly visited Rome and helped Sebastiano to revise the figure of Lazarus (three preparatory sketches by Michelangelo survive, in the Musée Bonnat, Bayonne and the British Museum, London). On 2 July 1518, Sebastiano wrote to Michelangelo to say that the altarpiece was almost finished, but that he was delaying completing it as he did not want Raphael – who had not yet started his own painting – to see the result. Raphael was reportedly attempting to have Sebastiano’s altarpiece dispatched to Narbonne so that the two paintings could not be viewed side by side in Rome. Sebastiano finished work on the painting by May 1519, when it was put on public view in his studio in Rome; in December 1519 it was formally unveiled at the Vatican to great admiration from everyone including the pope. This coincided with the birth of Sebastiano’s first son, for whom Michelangelo became godfather.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sebastiano consciously responded to ideas pioneered by Raphael. The vertical arrangement of the narrative derives from Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ falls on the Route to Calvary</span>, the so-called ‘Spasimo di Sicilia’, of 1516–16 (Prado, Madrid). In that picture Raphael had arrived at a groundbreaking solution to the long-standing problem of fitting a narrative into the vertical format of an altarpiece – he placed the focus of the action in the foreground below a high horizon line and then depicted the rest of the action in the background. Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> similarly adapts elements of Sebastiano’s work – the gesture of the apostle pointing to Christ is derived from Sebastiano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentation of Christ</span> (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg), and its arrangement of the apostles at the left and the kneeling woman reflects and seems to offer a critical comment on Sebastiano’s composition in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Raising of Lazarus</span>. Raphael must also have been following the progress Sebastiano was making at the same time on his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> in the Borgherini Chapel in S. Pietro in Montorio in Rome; his painting provides a more weightless counterpoint to Sebastiano’s more grounded composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In a tragic twist of fate, the first display of Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> was above his own coffin. He died from a fever on his thirty-seventh birthday, 6 April 1520. While Sebastiano’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Raising of Lazarus</span> was sent to Narbonne Cathedral, Cardinal Giulio decided to keep Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> in Rome and commissioned a copy of it to be sent to France. He placed the original on the high altar in the church of S. Pietro Montorio in Rome, close to Sebastiano’s Borgherini chapel, with its version of the same subject.</p></div>
