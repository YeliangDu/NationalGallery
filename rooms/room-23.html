He subordinates colour to a subtle harmony of browns, greys and greens, allowing him to focus on the virtuoso rendering of light and texture. The cool gleam on the pewter, the transparency of the glass, the crisp crust of the bread and the moist peel of the lemon are painted with astonishing realism. The picture’s horizontal format is well suited to such a complex tabletop scene. Datable to about 1628, this painting comes from a pivotal moment in Claesz’s career, when he had begun to move away from the brighter and abundantly colourful palettes of his predecessors to develop the subdued, atmospheric style for which he is most celebrated</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>For this bouquet, de Bray has selected only flowers that bloom in the same season, at the beginning of summer. Thus the artist’s goal was to paint a natural bouquet and not an imaginary one.</p> <p>The stark beauty of this bouquet is a far cry from more typical, densely crowded <a href="/paintings/glossary/composition">compositions</a>. De Bray masterfully balanced the height of the columbines and peony with the trailing morning glories. The palette is boldly limited, the red and white petals contrasting dramatically with the dark, impenetrable background. These colour accents are skillfully arranged, as for example the <a href="/whats-on/dutch-flowers-in-detail?viewPage=6">ladybird</a> tiptoeing along the marble which provides an intelligent red counterpoint amidst the blue notes. This painting has a quiet, mystical quality conveyed by details like the bumblebee, quietly hiding behind the pot.</p></div>

Floris van Dijck was among the city’s most important pioneers in the field of still-life painting. Celebrated for their precise realism, his paintings invariably depict banquet tables laden with bread, cheese, fruits, and luxurious glassware.

It is largest work by Van Dijck to have survived and, within his small oeuvre, ranks as among his most impressive. Moreover, it is a superb example of the beginnings of the great Dutch tradition of painting so-called banquet still lifes. Such early examples are characterised by a predilection for delicacies laid out on a table, piled high and seen as if from a bird’s-eye view, allowing all the goods on display to be clearly visible, in much the same way as early flower still lifes of the same period tend to show every flower individually.</p></div>

It provided further stability and may well explain why works by the artist are exceedingly rare, as there was little financial incentive for him to be productive. Only just over a dozen of his paintings have survived. Even so, his banquet still lifes defined the genre and his works were the fountain from which a great tradition of opulent still-life painting sprang: the works of artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OU2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter Claesz</a> in Haarlem, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Willem Kalf</a> in Rotterdam and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QHO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Davidsz de Heem</a> in Utrecht and Antwerp – to name but a few – are unthinkable without the pioneering example set by Van Dijck.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The breakfast still life shows a richly laid table with fruit, olives, sweets and butter shavings in various blue and white Wan Li Chinese export porcelain bowls, a stack of cheese and apples on pewter plates, a knife, a leather gourd, a stoneware Schnabelkanne, a silver-gilt nautilus cup, a roemer, stemmed glass flutes, a pewter plate with spices and a slice of melon, and various scattered fruits, breads and nuts, all arranged upon a white lace and damask cloth laid over a red damask cloth covering a table.

Here, they are surrounded by grapes and various fruits in blue and white Wanli earthenware Chinese export porcelain bowls, two drinking glasses, nuts and further fruits scattered on the table, and a piece of bread and a sliced apple and its peel on a pewter plate precariously placed on the edge of a table covered with a red damask cloth and white lace. The elevated viewpoint is similar to early landscapes which also tend to adopt a bird’s-eye perspective. Many later Dutch still lifes take their cue from works such as this, even if their viewpoint gradually becomes lower and the colours more subdued.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Huge clouds float across a wide sky, seeming to dwarf everything below – even the two frigates heading way out to sea, sails raised, tall and majestic. From the gunports of one, a cannon blazes in salute to signal their departure. The puffs of smoke are painted with light, airy swirls of white, making miniature versions of the clouds overhead; there’s even a tiny, but brilliant, flash of gold and orange from the unseen cannon’s mouth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although these two stately ships are in the distance, they are the focus of the picture. Van Goyen placed the closer figures in their fishing boats in deep shadow, almost in silhouette, making them seem incidental. Frigates were light warships that protected the giant merchant vessels that were the lifeblood of the new Dutch Republic, reaching out across the world and bringing wealth to the small but powerful nation. And van Goyen has positioned them almost centrally, with a clear sweep of water between them and us – it’s as if everything has moved aside to allow them freedom of the waterways.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sea is calm, the reflections on its surface clear and barely rippled – even the gun smoke is mirrored as if there’s another cannon firing under the water. The men in the small boats go about their tasks or sit, simply taking in the view. But they don't look at the departing frigates: to them, the ships have become a part of everyday life. Beyond the slackened, tawny brown sail of the fishing boat, the sails of a windmill stretch up to catch a sudden glimpse of the sun – two kinds of sail that appear like a repeating rhythm through Dutch land and seascapes of the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Goyen has given us a panoramic view, but also many minute details. Two fishing nets stand up like transparent flags in the larger boat out by the little island. Big round baskets await a catch in the rowing boat close to us. Beside it, a bare branch seems to curve round to point the way for the two frigates.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know if the painting represents a specific place. It’s probably an amalgamation of small scenes from van Goyen’s many drawings. These were made on the spot and out of doors, but the final painting was worked up in the studio (standard practice at the time). He worked extremely fast, sometimes painting a picture in a day, but this speed didn’t stop him from portraying poetic visions of the Dutch landscape that hold the gaze and appeal to the imagination. This picture is quiet and serene and, with the towering sails on the departing ships, the tiny Dutch flag fluttering from the fishing boat and the upward sweep of the sunlit clouds, somehow buoyant and full of hope.</p></div>

Known as ‘merry companies’, the scenes derive from representations of biblical stories that involved excessive feasts. They were often engraved with moralising verses, which condemned foolish and extravagant behaviour, and it’s likely that at least some contemporary viewers would have understood the picture in that sense. The partly visible painting in the background probably shows Christ being arrested by Roman soldiers, an episode that would ultimately lead to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. While religious paintings were no longer commissioned to hang in churches in the Protestant Dutch Republic, they still decorated the houses of the upper and middle classes, and this was a popular subject. The inclusion of this scene within the painting – a device that Hals often used – might hint at an underlying moralising message. Likewise, the withering flowers littering the floor display the group’s carelessness and wastefulness (although they might also be seen as a reminder of the transience of life).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dirck</a> was the younger brother of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Frans Hals</a>, who influenced him with his painterly and colourful technique. In fact, Dirck adapted the quick and lively brushwork championed by his brother to his small-scale <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre paintings</a>. Just like in his brother’s large-scale works, here we find areas where Dirck worked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a> or made use of the beige <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> coming through. He prepared figures in drawings and oil sketches that he would then use, with little alteration, as the basis for figures in his paintings, sometimes even more than once.</p></div>

It’s an unconventional pose, but one which gives a strong impression of immediacy and informality: the man here seems to have just pushed back his chair and turned towards us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sense of spontaneity is enhanced by the way Hals has manipulated our gaze. He didn't want viewers to get lost in the detail of the sitter’s costume, for example: his concern was to suggest rather than define. The billowing ruff is depicted not with polished precision but with a combination of short darts of the brush, with a few delicate touches to evoke its transparency as it rumples up around the sitter’s cheek and chin. The seams, tailoring and textures of the jacket or mantle are evoked with bold, broad strokes of black, white and grey paint. These effects help to trick our eye – we interpret the blurring as movement, and we can almost hear the rustle of the fabric as the sitter turns towards us. But Hals did use detail where it counts. The upward flick of the sitter’s moustache, the four precise white highlights that glisten on his lower lip, and the strands of flattened hair that seem to stick to his forehead – as though he has just taken off his hat – are all crucial touches that help to bring his face to life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter has not been identified but his age and the year he sat for Hals (1633) are inscribed beneath the artist’s monogram on the right-hand side of the painting. However, the canvas has been cut down slightly on the right edge, and the second digit of the sitter’s age has been lost – we know only that he was in his thirties. It is extremely likely that he was a citizen of Haarlem, where Hals lived and worked for most of his life. Apart from that his identity is not known.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It was once thought that this picture might be a pendant to <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Middle-Aged Woman with Hands Folded</a></span>, with the suggestion that the two sitters were a married couple. But there is no concrete evidence for this and uncertainties over the original size of both paintings (the other may also have been cut down slightly) make it impossible to make a convincing argument.</p></div>

She holds an expensive fan made of feathers, set in a gold mount and suspended from a gold chain. This object functions as a status symbol but also serves to give the woman’s pose movement.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting demonstrates <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Frans Hals</a>’s gift for creating lively and animated portraits that suggest distinctive personalities, even though the sitter’s identity remains a mystery. Painted life-size in three-quarter-length, she stands against a monochrome beige-brown background and looks directly at us. Bright light falls on her even face and her hands, and she holds a fan made of feathers, set in a gold mount and suspended from a golden chain. The elegant dress and jewellery suggest that the woman, like many of Hals’s patrons, may have been the wife of a wealthy citizen of Haarlem.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Hals has paid great attention to the detail of this woman’s elegant clothing. She wears wide lace-trimmed cuffs and a large, flat, three-tiered collar decorated with a silver bow. Elaborate collars like this began to replace older types in about 1640, when this picture was probably painted. This is supported by the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man, a Woman and a Boy in a Room</a></span> by Pieter Codde, dated 1640, in which the woman wears a very similar costume. And there is an even closer similarity to the costume depicted in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Woman</span>, also of 1640, by Johannes Cornelisz. Verspronck, Hals’s Haarlem colleague and possible pupil (Rijksmuseum Twenthe, Enschede). In Verspronck’s painting, the lace collar and cuffs as well as the silver bow virtually replicate those worn by Hals’s sitter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Fans began to appear in portraits in the 1630s, but they were in fashion in the Netherlands much earlier. The one depicted here was the most popular type and, like all kinds of fans, was expensive. But Hals didn't just use this fan to convey the sitter’s status: it serves to give the picture movement. Rather than just resting her hands on the fan, the woman pulls playfully on the gold chain and holds the mount delicately between her thumb and ring finger – a position that could change momentarily.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The way the woman’s right hand and fan are cropped and the way she seemingly crowds the frame is unusual and might suggest that the painting has been cut at the bottom edge and sides.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Holding a quill in his right hand, the man in this portrait has turned his head towards us, creating the feeling that we have just interrupted his work. He gives us – the source of the disturbance – a questioning look. His left eye is in the light even though half of his face appears in shadow, emphasising his expectant gaze as he waits for an explanation for the interruption.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is extremely simple, showing the sitter in half-length silhouetted against a plain brown-beige background. His black and white costume – a narrow-sleeved doublet and falling ruff dating from the 1620s and early 1630s – was considered old-fashioned by the time this portrait was painted. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Frans Hals</a> has used the sitter’s pose and his characteristic loose brushwork to give the portrait an air of movement and spontaneity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An inscription in the background next to the sitter’s head informs us that this portrait was painted in 1638 when the sitter was 33 years old. It shows Jean de la Chambre (1605/6–1668), a distinguished calligrapher and master of the French School in Haarlem. We know that he was member of the French Protestant Church, and that he married twice in Haarlem and had five children. His son Jean de la Chambre the Younger succeeded him as master of the French School. When the school was offered for sale after this son’s death in 1686, it was described as new and solidly built, with a schoolroom and dining hall big enough to hold 60 to 70 children, with several rooms for boarders.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Compared to the ambitious large-scale portraits of members of the ruling classes for which Hals is known, this is a relatively unassuming – but nonetheless powerful – work. It was painted as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FI6-0008-0000-0000.htm">modello</a> for an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIC-0008-0000-0000.htm">engraving</a> executed by the Haarlem printmaker Jonas Suyderhoef. The engraving was used as the frontispiece for a book published by Jean de la Chambre in the same year, which contained six engraved plates of examples of his calligraphy. Suyderhoef’s print gives the title of the book as well as the date 1638 (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Various writings, written and engraved on copper, by Jean de la Chambre, lover and devotee of the pen, at Haarlem. 1638</span>) and records that it was engraved after a painting by Hals. The print is one of the few by Hals’s contemporary engravers that does not reverse the painting it copies. In his frontispiece, de la Chambre, proud of his calligraphy, probably wanted to be shown with his pen in his writing hand. Hals made two more portraits of calligraphers that are lost today but known from contemporary engravings – both show the sitter with a quill in their right hand.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A life-size figure stands before us, holding a skull in one hand and gesticulating with the other. Shown close up, the young man is facing us frontally but looks to his left, his eyes fixed on something that lies outside of the painting. It is the gesture of his right hand that focuses us. Dramatically foreshortened, his fingers seem to project out of the canvas into our space. With his open mouth and hand, it appears as if he is either about to talk or pausing in the middle of a declamation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of Hals’s most captivating paintings, as well as an outstanding example of his bold technique of painting freely and quickly, which sets him apart from most artists of the time. There is no trace of the underpainting that was usually employed at the time. The drapery was laid down in one layer over a reddish <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a>, which shows through in places to provide mid-tones between highlight and shadow. In some areas, such as the red feather, the paint was applied <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ7-0008-0000-0000.htm">wet-in-wet</a>, blending some of the colours. The contour of the nose was even scratched through wet paint, perhaps with the handle of the brush. And some areas, such as the skull, are modelled with very course hatching.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is not a portrait. The skull  is a symbol of mortality, a reminder of the transience of human life. Such a subject is known as a ‘<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FI8-0008-0000-0000.htm">vanitas</a>’ (Latin for vanity), a name derived from a verse in the Old Testament (Ecclesiastes 12: 8): ‘Vanity of vanities, saith the preacher, all is vanity.’ The symbolic character of the painting is underlined by the young man’s costume, which is not contemporary. The beret with a large ostrich feather and the drapery are a fanciful recreation of sixteenth-century fashion, used by painters and actors alike mainly to represent <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> and historical figures. In fact, the subject has in the past been incorrectly identified as the graveyard scene from William Shakespeare’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hamlet</span> (Act V, Scene I), in which Hamlet finds the skull of Yorick, his father’s beloved court jester. Holding the skull, Hamlet speaks as if Yorick is alive before him, and contemplates the temporary nature of life. But there is no evidence that Shakespeare’s famous play was ever performed in the Dutch Republic or translated into Dutch during Hals’s time. Rather, both the painting and Shakespeare’s famous scene are rooted in the same tradition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Netherlandish tradition of showing young boys holding skulls can be traced back to engravings of the early sixteenth century. A similar composition to Hals’s painting can be found in a pen drawing by Hendrick Goltzius of 1614. It shows a fancifully dressed youth with a skull, wearing a beret with a multitude of feathers. The Latin inscription in the background leaves no doubt about the symbolic character of the picture. Translated, it reads: ‘Who escapes? No man.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although apparently casually displayed, the objects in this <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still life</a> would immediately have suggested wealth and extravagance to a seventeenth-century viewer. The cloths have a satin-like sheen, soft to the touch, and the objects on them are all expensive luxuries in a carefully designed display to show wealth. They also demonstrate <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Heda</a>’s skills in painting textures, objects projecting out of the picture towards us and subtle, rich colours.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The objects have been chosen not just because they are rare and precious – they also show how Dutch merchants brought  exotic items from far-flung parts of the globe. The olives and lemons come from the Mediterranean, the blue-and-white porcelain dish from China and the peppercorns from the East Indies. Other items originate in the Dutch Republic but were still very expensive: the lobster, the stand supporting the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">roemer</span> (the stubby glass with florets on the stem) and the elaborately crafted gold goblet with a Roman warrior, possibly the god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mars</a>, on top. The waterfowl perched on the terracotta pot hints at the dish inside it, but is also – wings open in an impressive display – a visible symbol of affluence. Grains of rock salt are shown glittering like jewels in a silver holder.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such displays of wealth  were sometimes a reminder of the transience of earthly belongings, but they are certainly evidence of the lavish lifestyles of Dutch merchants during the seventeenth century. But there is perhaps a hint of time passing. The peppercorns have been tipped from a crushed paper tube, which started out as a cone. This was the usual method of parcelling up spices and in paintings sometimes, as in this case, made from a page taken from an almanac. Heda shows it in this picture as trashed, reminding the viewer of its ephemeral nature. In another painting, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FIE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Still life: Pewter and Silver Vessels and a Crab</a></span>, the almanac cone is pristine, but the peppercorns still spill out.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Heda’s ability to represent real objects in paint is clear – things gleam, reflect, or glow. The light, coming mainly from the left, catches the bird’s wing; two quick stokes of the brush reveal a tall flute glass almost invisible against the dark background. In several places, light reveals wine or water seen through glass (an artist’s skill in showing this phenomenon was particularly valued at the time). Two pewter plates project over the edge of the table, while the tube containing a scroll and a carving knife point away from us on diagonal lines, demonstrating Heda’s command of perspective in different ways.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Embroidered on the tablecloth is a cipher that seems to refer to a merchants' guild, perhaps implying that the painting was commissioned by  such a guild. The handsome red lobster with the beady eye, placed with such prominence, perhaps suggests a connection with the sea as the source of their wealth.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">‘He who plays with cats gets scratched’ – in other words, he who looks for trouble will get it. This is an old Dutch motto that appears to be a possible source for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Judith Leyster</a>’s cheerful picture. Children’s activities were commonly used in Dutch seventeenth-century painting to point out the bad behaviour of adults, and it’s been suggested that Leyster’s picture was intended to serve as both delightful entertainment and a warning.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Dutch morality pictures of the time, a little girl would be expected to show a good example. While the girl in this picture may look straight out at us, holding up a warning finger in case you plan something naughty, she has an older brother to lead her astray. She has a wicked twinkle in her eye and the fingers of her other hand curl round the cat’s tail, ready to give it a tug.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The boy has tempted the cat to come to him using an eel, but he holds it up enticingly out of reach. The cat’s ears are pricked up in discomfort and anger, and the boy has to hug the animal hard to keep it prisoner. He looks up with a cheeky grin, at some unseen adult perhaps. Leyster has captured his half-guilty, half-unashamed expression – he seems to be testing just how far he can go.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leyster has chosen dark, sombre colours for the costumes and background to show up the fresh complexions, sparkling eyes and lively expressions of the children. As was the custom in Holland at the time, they are dressed like mini-adults. The girl’s collar and bonnet and the boy’s scarf are beautifully white and clean, and their hair is neat and tidy. The brim of the boy’s spectacular hat is caught up jauntily at one side in the new fashion. Although they are up to mischief, they are clearly the offspring of a prosperous, middle-class family – which is unusual for a picture of this kind. Badly behaved children were most often shown as from the underprivileged classes, though usually with affection and sympathy (look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Two Boys and a Girl making Music</a></span>, for example).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A happy young couple make music in an elegant, panelled room with costly furniture. An open door, marble columns on either side, reveals a glimpse of a room beyond, where a fine gauze curtain hangs at a window. The young man sits at his ease, his long fingers plucking the strings of the theorbo – an ancient instrument, now rarely played. The young woman plays the cittern, an instrument that’s easier to master.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The book of music balanced precariously on the woman’s knee reveals a pentimento, a visible trace of earlier painting beneath a layer of paint. The book may have been added almost as an afterthought; the folds in the woman’s apron can now be seen through it. The cello in the background seems also to be an afterthought, almost hanging in midair, the hat perched on top cutting across the face of the servant in the shadows.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Molenaer</a> displays his great skills in painting textures: the sleek coat of the dog, the gleam on the pewter jug and the intricate carving of the stool it stands on, and the fragile fretwork on the instruments. But most of all he enjoys the fabrics worn by the young couple: the man’s starched cuff, his richly decorated, ribboned sleeve and even the wrinkles of his stocking contrast with the delicate lace of the woman’s cap and collar, the soft lawn of her white cape and the green-pink sheen of her taffeta skirt. In her hair is a long, silver pin with a tiny jewel at the tip.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She places a foot on a foot warmer full of hot coals, a homely object that, in Dutch painting at this time, sometimes symbolised the passion with which a suitor pursues his intended bride. Molenaer, like many other genre painters, leaves his audience to draw their own conclusions – or better still, to choose one of several meanings. The servant brings a plump chicken – a bridal feast, an intimate supper or even symbolic of the young woman herself. The woman has discarded a shoe and wears a red stocking, and both were sometimes used as a sign of promiscuity. The footstool could be interpreted as fuelling the owner’s desires since it heats not just the feet but under the skirts as well.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sensitively painted faces of the three characters make the picture even more intriguing: the young man looks happy but the girl’s expression is enigmatic, and the maid may or may not approve of events. But the little dog could stand for fidelity, and the closed lid of the jug for the unsullied virtue of the young woman, perhaps meaning that the music they play is a song of true love.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The mischievous smiles of three children light up a dreary room with bare walls and little furniture – the barrel suggests it may be the back room of an inn. Their clothes are shabby and torn, but each has a sparkle in the eye and they look at home in their surroundings as they raise a din with their music.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With his use of smooth brushwork and eye for detail, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Molenaer</a> has given us a picture with a story waiting to be teased out. The boy with the violin plays with abandon but not too much accuracy, perhaps. His stockings have holes and tumble round his shins, showing a knobbly knee. His coat hangs open carelessly but it has all its buttons. His white ruff is clean but hangs limp. He’s tucked a clay pipe into his jaunty hat. At the time, tobacco was frowned on in the well-run family, but the clues the artist lays in the painting suggest that this family has difficulties.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The boy in the bright red jacket plays the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">rommelpot</span>, a home-made instrument that made a deep throbbing noise when you rubbed the stick up and down between fingers and thumb. His trousers look like hand-me-downs – too big for him and held up with cord below the knees – and in his hat he sports a hen’s leg, the badge of a company of arquebusiers (infantry soldiers). Behind him is a stick for playing <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kolf</span>, the forerunner of golf played on the ice in Dutch winters. With his rosy cheeks, he seems like a boy who might spend a lot of time outdoors.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The little girl adds to the noise with her spoons, attacking an old morion helmet (the Dutch fought many wars in the seventeenth century). Her apron is torn, and the gathers hastily cobbled together. Her hair strays from under her little cap. She wears the gorget, or neck plate, from the  old armour, rust round its rim. With his love of detail, Molenaer has even painted a reflection of the armour in the bowl of the spoon in the child’s left hand.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The worn-down shoes of the boy in red are thrown aside and he sits with his grubby, bare feet on a woman’s foot warmer, empty of coals. Molenaer may have been suggesting that the woman of this family is too busy to sit about in comfort. The empty cage and the broken neck of the large earthenware bottle standing on two well-thumbed books add to the unruly and slightly enigmatic nature of the scene. Molenaer painted pictures that were deliberately open to interpretation for a public that enjoyed such puzzles.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man in the centre of this picture tends to a fire, using a pair of bellows to stoke the flames. He works in a chaotic, dingy room. Jars, bottles and tools are strewn across every available surface; plaster flakes off the walls, leaving bricks exposed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A discarded piece of paper by the foot of the stool reads ‘oleum et operam perdis’ (meaning ‘oil and work is wasted’), words from the treatise <span class="dokuwiki_italic">De Re Metallica</span> (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">On the Nature of Metals</span>’). This book, published in 1556, provided information about the mining, refining and smelting of metals, and it helps to identify this man as an alchemist. A pair of glasses on top of the stool suggests that, before beginning to heat the pot on the fire, he had been studying the book. The belief that base metals could be transformed into silver and gold endured into the eighteenth century, but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen van Ostade</a> appears to be implying that it is an act of folly. The alchemist’s weary expression also suggests that this is a hopeless task.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dark curtain used to separate the room into two sections has been drawn back, revealing the alchemist’s family in their living quarters. Two young children are left to entertain themselves while their mother wipes the bottom of the baby she holds. The alchemist pays them no attention, focusing instead on the pursuit of riches; they have been relegated to the shadowy background. Van Ostade has created a visual hierarchy to reinforce this idea: the highly detailed foreground contrasts with the more sketchy quality of the background figures and their surroundings. But even with this hierarchy, the two sections are still linked. Light infuses the spaces around both the alchemist and his family, and the glow connects the two sections in a diagonal line as well as drawing our eyes to the figures. Van Ostade has used a limited colour palette of warm purple and brownish hues to emphasise the shadows, and he was influenced by the strong contrasts of light and dark that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> used in his work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist’s signature and date of the picture are depicted on a shovel that hangs on the wall next to the fireplace.

The rooms usually have an air of poverty, with bare and smoke-stained walls. In some, battered furniture and broken crockery suggest the brawls that van Ostade also sometimes portrayed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The room in this picture is drab, and the fallen broom and the litter suggest it’s none too clean, but the characters in the foreground are more kindly treated. Although the fireplace is empty and the lighting dingy, the small group is quite homely and the relationship between them seems companionable. The woman hands the man in the low chair a glass of beer with a smile and, behind them, the man on the bench toasts them with a toothless grin, holding up his open tankard and his clay pipe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dim light from the glazed window makes soft shadows; these, and the dark earth colours, give the room warmth and intimacy. Van Ostade has made the hurdy-gurdy player of the title difficult to see, so we are more aware of the couple on the bench against the wall. Their faces are barely lit but their enjoyment of the music can still be seen. The musician leans forward, broad-brimmed hat over his eyes, giving us a bird’s-eye-view of his hook nose and his grin, and of the cumbersome instrument under his arm. On the wall behind them is a print, a river scene unframed and tattered – but still an effort to cheer up the room.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ostade may have been a student of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Frans Hals</a>, together with the young Flemish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OXM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen Brouwer</a>, though their work shows little of Hals’s influence. Rather, they went in their own direction, with Brouwer, the older of the two, perhaps helping to form van Ostade’s style. They both delighted in robust – and sometimes raunchy – scenes of peasant life (see Brouwer’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tavern Scene</a></span> or van Ostade’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVU-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Peasant Courting an Elderly Woman</a></span>). These genre paintings were popular in seventeenth-century Holland, sometimes serving as a moral lesson in manners and lifestyle to middle-class families, but more often seen as a comical addition to liven up a more serious collection.</p></div>

The horse’s handsome tail and the shiny buttons on the rider’s coat are displayed in minute detail. Behind them, an eager dog is restrained by its master. Its lean companion sniffs at the earth, its ribs showing beneath the fur.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cool early morning sunlight glows across the foreground, over the hen pecking at the rough turf to the two fine pigs, snouts to the ground, grubbing for food. A woman in a white cap carries two heavy buckets slung from the wooden yoke across her shoulders. She smiles as she chats to a man in a quilted jacket with a cloak slung over one arm. Behind her a small crowd gathers round the cow she has probably been milking.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Life seems to amble along in this painting: there’s time to stop and chat, for the horseman to pause and for the man beside him to communicate with his dogs. The countryside setting appears almost timeless, though van Ostade has explored the effects of time. Light flickers up the wall of the old, crumbling house, revealing the rich browns and ochre of the brick, the wood and the rusting metal. Smoke comes from the chimney although the house seems otherwise deserted, its thatch thinning and weeds growing from the roof. A dovecot under the eaves looks abandoned and the strange iron bars at one gaping window are broken and uneven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The skeletal outline of the dead oak tree on the right is more prominent than the much larger living tree to the left. Van Ostade has given it a promise of life, with foliage sprouting from its trunk, while the younger tree seems almost to be growing from the side of the old house. It’s as if he’s showing nature as eternally renewing itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is typical of the artist’s country scenes, with skilfully depicted objects and subtle colours and textures giving realism and mood. Despite the details to be explored in the foreground, the eye seems drawn along the path ahead of the horseman. Passing more figures in the shadows, you come to a gap in the distant trees. Beyond, in the far distance, is a church spire, little more than a grey needle outlined against the sky – and yet holding the attention. In a deeply Protestant country, perhaps van Ostade means us to understand this as the end of the rider’s journey and, by inference, the journey’s end for everyone.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ostade was taught by his brother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen</a>, a painter of scenes of peasant life (for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSF-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Interior of an Inn</a></span>).

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This, one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Ruisdael</a>’s most famous paintings, is a much bigger version of a similar landscape by him that is also in our collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FT2-0001-0000-0000.htm">An Extensive Landscape with Ruins</a></span>. Other smaller versions also survive. We don’t know which was painted first but this sizeable picture was almost certainly painted on commission and was designed to hang in a very large room. The others were made for more modest surroundings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The size of this painting is matched by the sense of grandeur van Ruisdael has managed to create; the vast sky is obviously important to this. It takes up about two thirds of the painting – a typical proportion in Dutch landscapes. But the way that the clouds seem to billow up towards us against a blue summery sky adds dynamism to the grandeur.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The landscape is underpinned with structural devices which help lead our eye into the painting. Closest to us, in the left foreground, stand two shepherds. They were painted by one of van Ruisdael’s contemporaries, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen van der Velde</a>, though they may well have been part of the original design. Combined with two much tinier figures on the road down towards the church, they help us understand the scale of the landscape – and tempt us to follow the winding path further, past the cottages until it disappears among the fields.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ruisdael has used highlights, picked out by the sunshine which has momentarily broken through the clouds, to reinforce these devices and to add to the sense of depth. The sun illuminates not only the shepherds, but a sequence of features set at different distances from the viewer: first the castle and swans in the foreground, then the fields on the left and those which surround the windmill in the middle distance. A thin strand of blue shimmers on the horizon, suggesting the sun glinting on the distant sea. Finally, furthest from our eye, are the silvery tops of the highest of those billowing clouds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As well as appreciating the sense of scale and depth he was able to conjure, van Ruisdael’s customers would have understood another dimension to this picture. The pastoral figures and the ruins in the foreground allude to a Italian tradition of depicting <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3D-0008-0000-0000.htm">Arcadian</a> scenes of country life among the ruins of ancient Rome. They had first been made popular a few decades earlier by Dutch artists returning from Italy. There was no expectation that these paintings represented real places; they represented an idea of a classical Italian landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The same concept is true of this painting. Although it is reminiscent of the countryside around Haarlem, where van Ruisdael grew up and trained as an artist, no one has been able to identify the main church or an exact location for the panorama. Most likely it was an idealised view, evoking and reflecting ideas that he and his customers had about how Holland should look and what was important to them. The productive nature of the landscape was represented by the shepherds, the corn and the windmill; a sense of history by the ruined castle. The church – the building that dominates the horizon – stood, in their eyes, for eternal certainty.  </p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A rutted road leads into a wood, winds round to the right and over a rise to disappear. It doesn‘t reappear, but may lead away among distant trees and beyond them to a cottage, or it may wind again to the left towards the sunshine.  Similar scenes of the Dutch countryside – designed to please busy city dwellers wanting a moment of tranquillity in the home or a reminder of pleasant days out among nature – appear in many of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob van Ruisdael</a>’s early paintings. But this one seems a little different.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A lone tree quite often features in van Ruisdael’s landscapes, but seldom quite as prominently and close up as the one in this small painting. It’s an oak tree – in many of his pictures since they’re common in Holland – but he seems to have treated it as a specimen rather than part of a larger scene. He has paid great attention to detail: almost every leaf seems to have been shown in colours varying from deepest green to autumnal copper and bronze. The dark blue of the jacket and the warm yellow of the hat pick out the man taking a rest by the roadside. But these colours were carefully chosen – when mixed, they achieve some of the darker greens of the foliage. The man is picked out but still blends in with his surroundings, not disturbing the eye.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A closer look reveals that perhaps all isn‘t well with the tree. Threading through the foliage are many bare, crooked branches and twigs. A fallen branch stands at its foot. There’s a second, almost indistinguishable, trunk directly behind it – perhaps the closer tree is almost at the end of its life, and the mass of foliage standing out against the clouded sky belongs to the second. So this doesn’t become simply a portrait of a tree, rather than a landscape, van Ruisdael has crowded shrubs and saplings on to the left-hand side of the road as background. Unusually, he has included a flowering shrub to break the wall of green, to bring in light and allow a peep through the leaves at the woods beyond.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">All this is perhaps not unusual – there are aspects of this composition in many of van Ruisdael’s early works. But X-ray images show that the picture once looked very different. The trees beyond the two small figures climbing up the rise, the cottage with its sunlit thatch and the distant blue hill – all of these were late additions. Why van Ruisdael made the changes, we don't know. But without them, the work would present a very different mood. With no sun tipping the leaves of the distant trees the picture would be much darker and more sombre, and the oak tree against the sky would be almost overpowering – something far removed from a comforting reminder of a rustic scene.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob van Ruisdael</a> was the foremost seventeenth-century Dutch landscape painter, and was very productive and highly successful – there are about 20 of his pictures in the National Gallery alone. He paved the way for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Thomas Gainsborough</a>’s rural scenes painted in England in the eighteenth century. Gainsborough admired and made copies of van Ruisdael’s work, and owned three of his pictures. But rather than the idyllic pastoral views that appealed to Gainsborough, here van Ruisdael’s vision is of a more unruly, turbulent landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ruisdael’s familiar wind-tossed clouds are missing – these ones pass lazily over the landscape casting shadows, the soft greys not remotely threatening. Yet there’s something bleak and faintly melancholy about the picture. The ruins are close to us instead of safely in the distance, as they are in some of his other pictures, for instance, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQY-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Landscape with a Ruined Building</a></span> or <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPD-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Landscape with a Ruined Castle and a Church</a></span>. The paint of the sky is thinly applied, the spiky trees achieved with a flickering brush but the layers of crumbling plaster and brickwork appear thicker, quickly and roughly painted with an almost impressionistic feel. Yet van Ruisdael has portrayed some architectural detail realistically. The ribs of the vaulted ceiling are almost tangible, where they curve upwards and fan out from the columns against the inner wall and, abruptly cut off, disappear into space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We are invited through the archway, and yet there’s a warning. The dog appears unwilling to follow its owner into the ruin. The little girl holding the man’s hand looks up, as if enquiring why they are going into this eerie place and who is the shadowy figure on the inside. Van Ruisdael is showing us a ruin in a landscape, but he is also creating a mood and appealing to our imagination.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is a drawing by Jan van de Velde, a Dutch printmaker and contemporary of van Ruisdael, of the ruins of the castle of Huis der Kleef just outside Haarlem (now in the Teylers Museum, Haarlem). The castle was destroyed by the Spanish in 1573, during the war in which the Dutch fought for their independence from Spain. This drawing would suggest that the castle in van Ruisdael’s painting is the same building shown from a different viewpoint. But for many years the painting was known as ‘van Ruisdael’s Gate’ or ‘van Ruisdael’s Arch’, perhaps suggesting that it was more likely to be an imaginary building than a real one.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A grey and turbulent sky dominates the picture, but our eye is caught by the patch of bright sunlight in the middle ground. And if we look deeper, just to the right of the church, there are other flecks of yellow where the sun has broken through the clouds. This sense of fast-changing light brings the whole landscape to life, injecting movement into what otherwise might have been a static scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These brilliant lighting effects may help make it feel as though <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Ruisdael</a> has captured a real moment in a real landscape, but he almost certainly hasn’t. Instead, he has brought a fantasy to life. Despite much research, no art historian has managed to establish where exactly this scene might be; no one has convincingly identified the church, nor the ruins in the foreground. Even more tellingly, the National Gallery has two versions of the scene. Significant differences between them suggest that van Ruisdael was more interested in arranging key elements in a pleasing way than in describing a particular place. In the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPD-0001-0000-0000.htm">larger picture</a>, one of the ruined buildings in the foreground has been removed and replaced with a group of figures. The woodland and vegetation have been rearranged, the church moved much closer to the ruins, other spires and towers added to the horizon and a windmill placed in the centre of the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible that one of the two versions is a true account of what van Ruisdael saw and the other is an adaptation. But it’s much more likely that he was composing an idealised landscape – based on the countryside around Haarlem – and reflecting an idea that he and his customers had about how Holland should look and what was important to them. This is a rich pastoral harmony: the harvest is underway and a shepherd tends his flock. It is also a land framed by water. There is a fisherman on the moat in the foreground and, in the distance, a thin band of grey bounds the horizon: the sea. It reminds us of other vital sources of wealth – the great trading networks of the Dutch maritime fleet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We seem to be led to understand that all of this represents a bounty offered and protected by God. The church is central to the picture. Its tower and spire stand tall and resilient against an impending storm – a source of strength when times get rough. Other strongholds, like the ruined medieval castle in the foreground, slowly crumble.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In fact, different ideas of time are central to this painting. While the church suggests eternity and the ruins suggest the long span of history, that flash of sunlight makes it clear that we are witnessing a fleeting moment in the ever-changing weather. A sense of the rhythm of the seasons is strong too. This is clearly high summer. The trees are in leaf and sheaves of corn are lined up in the field, but the heavy grey sky reminds us that soon it will be autumn.</p></div>

The man on the bridge of the sluice is about to close the gate to stop the water pouring through. He seems to pause, perhaps to summon his strength, perhaps just pondering the flickering light on the rushing torrent.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The mill house is old and semi-derelict, its thatch bolstered up with bundles of reeds. The sound of water would be unceasing in this place: sometimes the waterfall, or a gentle stream when the gates were shut; sometimes rain or, when that stops, perhaps just the sound of water dripping through the roof.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the Museum Boijmans Van Beuningen, Rotterdam, there is a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Ruisdael</a> painting entitled <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Thatch Roofed House with a Watermill</span>. It’s thought to show the same mill seen from the back, but in warmer colours than the cool blues and grey-greens of this painting. In 1826, after seeing the Rotterdam picture, the British landscape painter John Constable wrote to his friend J. C. Fisher: ‘I have seen an affecting picture by Ruisdael. It haunts my mind and clings to my heart – a man and a boy are cutting reeds in a running stream (in the tail-run) – the water so true clear and fresh – as brisk as champagne.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It’s thought that the water mill shown belonged to the manor house of Singrave near Denekamp, a small village close to the German border, but another at nearby Haaksbergen has also been suggested as the model for the picture. Whichever is correct – if either of them is, bearing in mind that many Dutch pictures of the time were given titles long after their making – the setting of the mill is entirely van Ruisdael’s invention. There are no hills of the height he shows anywhere in Overijssel, the Dutch district where both villages are to be found. Van Ruisdael travelled quite widely, making sketches and drawings that he used imaginatively in his landscapes. He also used the drawings of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P6D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Allart van Everdingen</a>, who had been to Scandinavia and returned with mountainous views quite new and exciting in their rough grandeur. It’s unlikely that any of van Ruisdael’s more dramatic pictures are taken exactly from life, but were given a romanticised atmosphere that appealed to collectors living in the flat Dutch landscape.</p></div>

He didn‘t portray the great naval and merchant vessels that filled Dutch waters at the time, nor did he show battles or other important naval events.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Earlier painters often gave a metaphorical meaning to their marine pictures, such as the ’voyage of life‘ or ’ship of state’, but it’s unlikely that van Ruisdael was doing so. This would suggests that his marine paintings were made for private patrons or for the open market rather than company or municipal commissions (for which a metaphorical meaning with a moral message might be appealing).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting a small sailing vessel, probably a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kaag</span> (an inshore ferry boat), is driven before a fresh breeze under a vast, stormy sky, with a couple of passengers bundled up against the cold.

The vessel’s honey-coloured sails soften the starkness of the scene, making it seem an everyday journey that travellers by sea would be used to. The white sails of the boats speeding away from us give a sense of exhilaration rather than bleakness or danger. The motif of the waves breaking over the pilings of a jetty is repeated in many of van Ruisdael’s marine pictures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Only one drawing of a marine subject exists by van Ruisdael, but his colleague <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P6D-0001-0000-0000.htm">Allart van Everdingen</a> made several. Van Ruisdael used van Everdingen’s many sketches of Scandinavian landscapes as an inspiration for his own pictures of mountains and waterfalls; he may have used the marine sketches as a source as well.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Ruisdael’s early marine paintings seem to have been influenced by Jan Porcellis and Simon Vlieger, two successful marine artists who changed an earlier style of bird’s eye views – rather like maps with ships on them – to more realistic scenes. In these new pictures, as a means of suggesting distance, the horizon was lowered and the sea in the foreground was usually dark, with a band of light catching the waves and the important vessels in the centre, and another darker band out towards the horizon – as van Ruisdael has done in this picture. Later he abandoned this device for a less precise demarcation of the dark lines with a more even distribution of light, giving a feeling of a more immense space and elemental power to the scene – as in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sailing Vessels in a Stormy Sea on a Rocky Coast</span> (private collection, Vienna).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a picture of calm. A single branch points up out of water, leading our eyes across the painting towards the small boats almost hidden in shadows and reflections cast by the grey alder trees on the river bank.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The water is flat, without a ripple. The reflections are perfect. No wind stirs the sails, no flags lift in a breeze. The men in the boat are crouched and still, apart from one who stands upright facing a leafless tree ahead of him – almost like two sentinels with an invisible line between them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These vessels are <span class="dokuwiki_italic">kaags</span>, shallow-bottomed working boats for use mostly on rivers and canals. But <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PV7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salomon van Ruysdael</a> makes them stately and serene, their tall masts almost seeming to pierce the clouds, with a rhythmic line of trees and sails reaching out on a diagonal into the distance. Close to us, the only moving things are two birds that swoop low over the water. Further out, where the river appears to divide, the sail of a small boat seems to fill a little in the breeze and a family of ducks ventures across the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There were a handful of reasons to make such a painting. First was the idyll itself – a purely decorative and restorative picture hung on the walls of a busy Dutch household. But the black dots making a semi-circle on the still water are cork floats, defining the edges of a large fishing net. The men in the nearest boat aren't idling away their time. They are fishermen, and fishing was one of the main industries that gave the Dutch Republic its wealth. These are ordinary working men, shown realistically, thought worthy of a picture because they were part of the pride that the Dutch had in their building of a new nation: the taming of rivers, the digging and reinforcing of canals and dams, the creation of a new land from the sea by hard labour. Dutch lives and livelihoods were built on water and they wished to celebrate it in all its forms.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Salomon van Ruysdael was one of a family of painters, including his nephew <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob van Ruisdael</a>, who specialised in land and seascapes. Although living in Haarlem, it appears that Salomon travelled widely in the Netherlands as he produced views of many other towns and cities. He left no drawings or sketches, so must have painted from memory or from the many prints available made by other artists.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The technique of showing distance by portraying a spit of land cutting across the canvas on the diagonal and diminishing in size is particularly his, but Salomon shared his taste for painting in soft muted greys, greens and browns with his fellow marine landscape artist and colleague, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QE0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Goyen</a>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Stables were found everywhere in the seventeenth century – but this is no ordinary one. A peacock is perched on a branch at the entrance. Outside, there’s part of a weathered but grand building; birds nest on its roof and climbing plants drift over windows. The entrance and the trees give an air of age and continuity. All are clues to the kind of establishment this is: the stable of an old aristocratic household, with its many grooms, stable boys and coachmen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At first, it seem almost too dark to see the cavernous inside of the stable – as if you need to take a moment for your eyes to adjust to the shadows, as you would if you were there. The spirited white pony with the scarlet rosette and the black blot on its rump grabs our attention. It paws the ground, its princely little head nods; its mane looks almost blow-dried into crisp waves. The lush yellow jacket and hat with curled feathers worn by the mounted horseman beside the pony is the next bright spot of colour to catch the eye. He leans to the side to bring his horse to a halt and seems to glance down at the transaction going on below him – a visitor, perhaps, tipping one of the stable boys for looking after his mount.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Outside, on the left, a woman gets water from a well; Wouwerman draws attention to the detail of the pulley overhead by her raised hand. A horse is led into the stable, and behind it a fine grey mare carries in a woman wearing silk, lace and feathers. On the far right side of the space, chickens cluck about for scraps and more horses wait their turn to be groomed. But there’s fun to be had in the stable too: a lad, probably the son of a stable boy, rides a frisky goat, while a woman tends its kid.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Wouwerman seems to have enjoyed using rich but subtle colours to paint scenes that give the viewer lots to discover, to interpret, and to discuss and return to. His skill in the portrayal of horses was supreme – his favourite, the white horse, appears in many of his pictures (look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8E-0001-0000-0000.htm">A White Horse and an Old Man binding Faggots</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G1N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Two Horsemen at a Gipsy Encampment, One having his Fortune told</a></span>). This skill and his ability to capture the genuinely expressive movement of the human body and face brought him enormous popularity in his own time and long after, and can still delight today.</p></div>
