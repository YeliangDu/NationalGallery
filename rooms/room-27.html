She is moments from being transformed by river nymphs into reeds, in answer to her prayers to escape her unwanted suitor.

The figures were probably painted by the Flemish artist Hendrick van Balen the Elder and the landscape by an artist working in the style of Jan Brueghel the Elder, who specialised in painting landscapes and flowers. The composition was probably inspired by a print of the same subject by Hendrick Goltzius.</p></div>

The amorous god had pursued Syrinx across Arcadia and here, seeing her escape route blocked, tries to grab her. Hearing her prayer for help to escape her unwanted suitor, the river nymphs are about to transform her into reeds. Pan later made musical pipes out of these very reeds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small oil on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1R-0008-0000-0000.htm">copper</a> painting illustrates a story from <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, a long verse narrative retelling ancient Greek and Roman legends by the Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>.

The painting also repeats other details from the print, such as buildings in the distance and the flowering plants in front of the figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was altered slightly at some point in its history. Someone, perhaps an earlier owner, seems to have found the depiction of Pan’s genitalia too graphic – overpaint is visible in this area, obscuring what was originally there.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clouds billow up over a wild, untamed valley. The far side is covered in bushes and scrub. A bare, chalky cliff face catches the sunlight and tips down into a ravine that leads away down a path hidden by the undergrowth. A man strolls there with a dog, both of them portrayed in silhouette by little more than a thin flick of the brush.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the near side of the valley, a peasant trudges up the steep side of the hill. His plough grinds into the stony earth, bald in places and infertile. His oxen strain at the weight, encouraged by the whip in the hand of a boy wearing rags with an old hat on the back of his head. One beast turns his eyes directly to us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But there is a rough grandeur in the picture. The oxen are fine animals, well muscled and rich in colour. The peasant himself is strong, windswept and sunburnt. His massive arms labour at the primitive plough; his shirt is shabby, but gleams white and clean in the sun. He leans back in a huge effort to shove the plough forward over the last lip of the hillside, digging in hard to have some effect on the unyielding soil. He is a forerunner of the many images of ‘the heroic peasant’ to come from Jean François Millet, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rosa Bonheur</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> and many other artists concerned with presenting the world as it was, rather than making the countryside an idealised Italianate myth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5U-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolaes Berchem</a> may have been one of the several Dutch artists who travelled to Italy in the early seventeenth century to paint landscapes in the softer Italian light and take inspiration from the Italian artists of the past who were considered the embodiment of high art. But the light in Berchem’s picture is cooler than that of Rome or Naples, and the towering clouds have a sea-blown feel, more like a scene from a landscape closer to a wilder sea than the Mediterranean. Yet the landscape isn't the familiar flat Dutch coastal view either. These are imaginary hills, or hills taken from a sketchbook that might have been made in Italy or possibly from a print in Berchem’s collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A small, atmospheric picture such as this would have been treasured in a collection decorating the panelled walls of a Dutch burgher’s house. The scene would have been admired for itself, but also hints at the fortitude of the Dutch peasants who worked the land of the newly founded Dutch Republic. At the time that Berchem painted his picture, these same peasants were – with monumental effort and grinding labour – creating new stretches of land from the sea through the digging of ditches and dykes.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Both</a> was one of a group of Dutch artists that made the long and often dangerous journey across the Alps to Italy, said at the time to be the heart of great painting. He stayed for ten years, coming to admire and be influenced by the work of the great French landscape painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>, who was then living in Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both, like other Dutch artists in Italy, appears to have been more influenced by his surroundings than by the great Italian masters of the past and became a leader in the development of Dutch Italianate landscapes. His pictures often feature hardy peasants against softly glowing skies, sometimes against the architecture and monuments of ancient Rome, subverting the ideal of great art: large paintings of Bible stories or historical events. His influence is particularly clear in some works of Nicolaes Berchem – for instance <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mountainous Landscape with Muleteers</a></span>. The contemporary Italian artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salvator Rosa</a>, was scathing about their work – particularly their interpretation of the Italian peasant as, in his view, idle and scruffy – but Claude must have found their work agreeable, and even collaborated with Jan Both.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is unusual for Both: he shows an urban view of architecture rather than a landscape, and his view of the Ripa Grande is partly imaginary. The Ripa Grande was the old port of Rome, at the foot of the Aventine, the furthest south of the seven hills of Rome; it had long since decayed. The tall central tower is just about recognisable as that of Santa Maria della Torre, although the windows are apparently different from the original. The tower stood on the banks of the Tiber beside the Ripa Grande, but the rest of the rundown buildings are Jan Both’s invention.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Both’s hardy peasants idle away their time playing cards in the evening sun. An old man leans on a boulder to smoke. A younger man squats out of the way, while another relieves himself against a wall. Up on the roof, others work under a makeshift canopy – whether mending or dismantling, it’s hard to tell. A man in a blue jacket perches precariously on the edge, stick in hand, a wide crack opening up in the wall beneath him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One man, wearing a red hat, his hands clasped behind him, gazes intently at the view. Shown in more detail than the other characters, he ignores the man crouched beside him. The distant landscape he surveys is misty, and the gold light left by the vanished sun casts shadows over the still water of the River Tiber. It is as if he is looking so intensely in order to remember what he sees, as Both himself may once have done.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In other paintings that Both made of the Ripa Grande from a different viewpoint the scene is more recognisable. It seems that in making this picture on his return to the Netherlands, he is painting partly from memory and partly from his imagination, but always with affection for the sunlit land he had left.</p></div>

He shows us an Old Testament story taking place in a completely imaginary Egypt, with luxuriant European foliage under a grey Northern sky and includes as many exquisitely detailed portrayals of antiquities as he can: obelisks, a column, a pyramid, and a stela (a carved commemorative stone slab). Not all these ancient objects are Egyptian but Breenbergh crowds them into the picture regardless, in order to convey that the story he tells is set in ancient times.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shows the story of Moses. The children of Israel were captive in Egypt, and Pharaoh decreed that all their male children should be killed in case they grew up to fight the Egyptians and depose him. Moses’s mother laid her baby in a rush basket and hid him among the reeds by the banks of the River Nile, leaving his sister Miriam to stand watch (Exodus 2: 1-6). The baby was found by Pharaoh’s daughter who wanted to keep him, but needed a wet nurse to feed and care for him. Miriam volunteered to find one, reuniting the baby with his mother. Moses grew up to lead the Israelites to their Promised Land.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the tradition of European painting of the time, Breenbergh painted Pharaoh’s daughter as a wealthy European woman, in a robe of satin and fur that combines European and imaginary biblical clothes. She is covered in jewels and has a long train, held by a little Black girl. She shields her pale complexion against the sun under a round parasol. Miriam, much less finely dressed, points to the empty basket; her mother, holding the swaddled baby Moses, is bundled up in peasant’s clothes and hat.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the painting, the story of the finding of Moses is placed in the foreground, yet it is almost incidental to the landscape. In line with the traditional method of conveying depth, darker, clearer colours appear at the base of the canvas; mid-tones, mainly of greens, in the centre; and blue-greys at the top with less distinct painting of specific objects. It takes a moment or two to make out the tall mountain because it’s so pale and blurred, almost blending into the sky – making it seem many miles away.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting of the antiquities is superb, however incongruous they may seem. Breenbergh will have taken them from etchings widely available in the Netherlands at the time. The central column works especially well – the sun glinting on the speckled, polished stone at the edge of the chasm down to the river. The pyramid too is convincing, picked out in the light, weather-beaten and ancient, the point on its silver globe reaching up towards the forest and the ruined castle towering overhead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But perhaps the most appealing details are the two camels plodding across the perilous viaduct among the slow-moving flock of sheep and the two men with an elephant on the river bank in the sunshine.</p></div>

Callisto was forced to undress and her pregnancy was revealed. This moment of discovery was a favourite subject with European patrons and artists from the fifteenth century onwards, perhaps for the opportunity it gave to show a number of nude female figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bril was born and trained in Antwerp, but moved to Rome in 1575. His encounter with the work of Italian artists, in particular Annibale Carracci and his followers, modified his style profoundly, which became calmer and more classicising. In the 1620s, under the influence of the Bolognese school, he also produced a number of landscapes like this, in which broad tranquil settings are inhabited by mythological figures.</p></div>

What draws all these people together under the cold, starlit sky to stare so intently, to wait patiently for their turn to come closer to the little child on his mother’s knee, reaching towards the old man kneeling at his feet? The starlight is cold, the trees leafless but the baby is bare – to show us that he is a real, human baby. But the silvery arrow of light from the star points him out as something more. A miracle has happened in this ramshackle hut, and word has got around.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We look down from a distance on the crowd around the hut. Each figure, each group has a story to tell, even the crowds in the misty distance. Someone has lobbed a shoe on to the thatched roof, maybe to silence the cock strutting about up there with his hens. A cat peers down from the hay loft at an old man kneeling to the baby – a king. He wears no crown, but his sceptre is on the ground beside him with the gold lid of his costly gift. On either side of him are his fellow monarchs, one in pink, the other in white. Although richly dressed, neither wears a crown. It’s the child that wears the true crown, a delicate halo that would outshine any earthly crown for it announces him as the Son of God, held in Mary’s strong, safe hands – and the kings can only gaze in awe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, dressed in his traditional yellow, peers out of the hut door as if unable to believe what’s happening. His tools lie abandoned under the tree near the shepherds. The shepherds huddle close to the side of the hut with their lurcher dogs, awkward, shy of the important visitors. One eyes the servant of the African king who holds his master’s enormous sword, while the king himself holds his gift to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> in an odd little boat-shaped casket.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These two figures also appear in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D3J-0001-0000-0000.htm">the work</a> of Jan Brueghel’s father, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pieter Brueghel the Elder</a> – founder of a dynasty of painters.

Kept on the shelf of a room full of curiosities and not on the wall, it was a talking point, but also the reminder of a great religious event – whoever owned it revered the subject. They enjoyed the characters and humour, but not least, the strange mixture of beauty and ugliness that Jan Brueghel often put into his pictures, bringing everyday people into incidents of great significance.</p></div>

Domenichino was a pupil of Annibale Carracci, whose sweeping ‘heroic’ panoramas often included identifiable figures. Like Annibale, Domenichino structured his landscapes carefully, using a winding river to draw the viewer’s eye into the distance, while two trees act as stage-like wings. The leaning tree on the left parallels the diagonal of the angel’s leaning body, while the gesture of his arm is echoed by the roots and branches of the trees on the river bank behind him.</p></div>

This is the story of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8T-0008-0000-0000.htm">Tobias and the Angel</a>, as told in the apocryphal Book of Tobit. A faithful Jew living in Nineveh, Tobit was blinded by God to test his patience, but his sight was restored by a miracle. He sent his son Tobias  to collect a debt. The archangel Raphael, whom Tobias thought was a mortal, went with the young man as his guide, and they reached the river Tigris, where Tobias was attacked by a gigantic fish. Raphael ordered him to catch it and remove its gall, heart and liver.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">They travelled on together to Ectabane, where Tobias’s cousin Sara lived. She was prey to a demon who had killed each of her seven husbands. Raphael asked Tobias to marry Sara in spite of his misgivings, and told him to grill the fish’s liver so that the smell would scare off the demon. Raphael, Tobias and Sara then retuned to Nineveh where, again following the angel’s advice, Tobias used the fish gall to restore his father’s sight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although this is a biblical story, the setting and dress of the figures is classical in style. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a> was a pupil of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>, whose sweeping ‘heroic’ panoramas often included identifiable figures, either from classical literature or from the Bible. Like Annibale, Domenichino structured his landscapes carefully, using a winding river to draw the viewer’s eye into the distance, while two trees act as stage-like wings. The leaning tree on the left parallels the diagonal of the angel’s leaning body, while the gesture of his arm is echoed by the roots and branches of the trees on the river bank behind him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When this picture was first recorded in the 1679 inventory of the collection of Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna – a patron of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> who was celebrated for his interest in landscape painting – it was paired with another landscape by Domenichino, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Moses and the Burning Bush</span>, now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. The paintings resemble each other in many ways. Both are painted on sheets of copper of a similar size and the handling of the paint is almost identical. Although the paintings are relatively small, they share a sense of spaciousness and the scale of the figures in relation to the landscape is the same in both. Furthermore, Tobias’s red tunic is the same shade as Moses’s cape. Although the two episodes are seemingly unrelated, both were understood in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> as forerunners of the virgin birth. The restoration of Tobit’s sight prefigured the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation to the Virgin</a>, while the burning bush was interpreted as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Immaculate Conception of the Virgin</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture, and its pendant in New York, is an important example of Domenichino’s contribution to landscape painting. None of his small landscapes can be dated securely but there are similarities with the Villa Aldobrandini frescoes, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EU5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Apollo slaying Coronis</a></span> and in particular <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOW-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Apollo pursuing Daphne</a>,</span> which were designed in 1616. These landscapes probably date from about the same time.</p></div>

This beast, having eaten all the available sheep, was being fed children, drawn by lot from both rich and poor. The lot eventually fell on the king’s daughter, who was dressed as a bride and delivered to the place where the dragon lived. When the dragon appeared George attacked but, rather than killing it, he told the princess to tie her belt around its neck and lead it to the city. There he promised the terrified citizens he would kill it if they all converted to Christianity. They hastily agreed, and George struck off the dragon’s head.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here George is shown mounted on a horse and charging the dragon, who crouches on a grisly collection of bloody bones, while the princess makes a hasty escape on the left. The city in the background must be Silene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although ostensibly a history painting, it is the landscape that is really the subject here. Renowned for large-scale <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> and altarpieces, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Domenichino</a> also painted numerous small landscapes. In spite of its relatively small scale, this picture conveys the sense of spaciousness which was one of Domenichino’s greatest contributions to landscape painting. He trained initially with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OUS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ludovico Carracci</a> in Bologna and in 1602 followed Ludovico’s cousin, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVI-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Annibale Carracci</a>, to Rome, contributing to the frescoes in the Farnese Gallery. He was already painting landscapes before 1603, and was hugely influenced by Annibale’s Roman landscapes, with narratives set in expansive, classicising countryside inspired by that on the outskirts of Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Domenichino took from Annibale the careful organisation of space, with rocks or trees in the foreground acting as ‘wings’ to focus the viewer’s attention on the narrative, but he was also influenced by the panoramic landscapes of Flemish painters working in Rome, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QVA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Bril</a>. Some aspects of the picture are unusual for Domenichino, such as the fantastical town in the background (Domenichino more usually included classical architecture).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An alternative attribution to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PP5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Battista Viola</a> has also been suggested. Viola sometimes collaborated with Domenichino and he is thought to have contributed to the execution of the frescoes in the Stanza di Apollo of the Villa Aldobrandini at Frascati, near Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If the painting is by Domenichino, its style suggests a relatively early date of around 1610–11, just before his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with Tobias laying hold of the Fish</a></span>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the shade of a steep cliff, a woman and a child wade in the shallow water of a ford. She looks down at the little boy as he takes a pee in the river. Perhaps they have had a long hot journey on the mule, its saddle made of wood, hard and unyielding. The animals wait patiently or lean down to drink. A sheep – its wool painted with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5H-0001-0000-0000.htm">Karel Dujardin</a>’s usual attention to realistic texture – is visible through the mule’s legs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure of the woman is unlike many of Dujardin’s Italian peasant women. They are usually neatly and cleanly dressed, with an open necked shirt under a tight bodice (look at <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLI-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Woman with Cattle and Sheep in an Italian Landscape</a></span> or <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FML-0001-0000-0000.htm">Farm Animals with a Boy and a Herdswoman</a></span>). She has loosened her garments to enjoy the sun and holds up her skirt to keep it out of the water, carefree and relaxed for a few minutes – although she hasn’t forgotten the child who looks up at her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of little nude boys were unremarkable in the seventeenth century – and quite often they were relieving themselves. Most famous perhaps is the Manneken Pis fountain in Brussels, which features a perky two or three year old. The difference in this picture is the age of the boy. He seems to be much older, perhaps eight or nine, his limbs strong compared with the chubby legs of a toddler.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dujardin’s picture has a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM8-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastoral</a> theme. This was much appreciated and sought after by Dutch collectors, bringing idealised images of rural life into their busy, crowded city lives. The cliffs behind are rocky and inhospitable but the water is cool and refreshing – the dusty path behind the group is already forgotten. Dujardin shows a charming, gently funny moment in rural life – but an Italian rather than a Dutch life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dujardin concentrated on landscapes but also painted portraits, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> subjects and biblical scenes (such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL5-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Conversion of Saint Paul</a></span>). But he seems in his element with his rural scenes, portraying the Roman Campagna (the countryside round Rome) as an idyllic setting for rural life. We aren't sure whether he went to Italy in his formative years, but he knew the work of other artists who had spent time there and used their sketches and paintings as the basis for his interpretation of the landscape. In this picture, he marries the rough terrain of the Italian mountains with the clear, bright blue skies and puffy clouds of the Netherlands, and echoes the light catching the heads of the woman and child with the sun catching the rocks above them.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This grand painting on a small scale uses the smoothness of its copper surface to paint intricate details on a minute scale. Saint Lawrence, a deacon of the early Christian church, is shown being stripped of his clothes in preparation for his execution – his outer garment lies crumpled in the bottom left corner. According to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, Lawrence distributed church property to the poor on the orders of the pope. When the Roman authorities discovered what he was doing, they ordered him to hand over the treasures – that is, precious objects and money – to the city. Lawrence refused, and when pressed to give up his Christian faith or face execution, he chose death. He was killed in AD 258.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figure in the red and gold robes is the Roman Emperor Decius. His patterned turban gives him the appearance of a figure from the Eastern Mediterranean. It might be a reference to images of the Roman governor Pontius Pilate, who condemned Christ to death in Jerusalem: Pilate is portrayed in similar dress in a woodcut (a type of print) showing the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Flagellation of Christ</span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>. Between the emperor and the saint, a Roman priest in a dark hooded cloak points to a statue of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Hercules</a>, son of the god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a>. The mythological hero stands in the same proud pose as Decius, a reference to the pagan gods that Lawrence refused to worship.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint’s punishment for his refusal was to be roasted alive. In the background to the right, two men stoke a fire beneath a gridiron, the instrument of Lawrence’s martyrdom. A mounted Roman soldier oversees their labour; he holds a banner inscribed with the initials SPQR, which stand for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">senatus populusque romanus</span> (‘the senate and people of Rome’). A crowd has arrived from the city to watch. In spite of the gruesome torture that awaits him, Lawrence does not struggle – he has opened his arms to assist his captors as they undress him. His eyes are cast upwards and his expression suggests he is in a state of spiritual ecstasy: he looks towards an angel who points to heaven, the inspiration of his strength.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adam Elsheimer</a> settled in Rome in the spring of 1600 and the city’s classical architecture provided inspiration for the backdrop to the scene. He has included minute decorative details, such as the frieze of the temple-like building behind Hercules, but the pagan structures are shown in decay: a vine encircles one of the columns, and the roots of small shrubs have fractured the pediment. In the dark sky above, three white birds fly towards the sunlit clouds; in the earth around the statue’s pediment is a cluster of thistles and wild grasses. As was usual in Elsheimer’s repertoire, he has included a huge amount of detail within a very small space.</p></div>

This allowed him to use strong contrasts of light and darkness for dramatic effect.

The turbulent sea tosses the wrecked ship’s cargo against the rocks; the strength of the gale forces the seawater to arc over a boulder and shoot up high against the cliffs, where it rains down as froth. The flames of the lighthouse, perched high on a craggy peak, are blown uncontrollably to one side, demonstrating the force of the storm. The wind agitates the fire that warms the wreck’s survivors as well as their clothes, throwing up red-hot ash which glitters in the darkness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Paul</a>’s shipwreck on the island of Malta is described in Acts (28: 1–6) – the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> was on his way to Rome where he was to face punishment at the hands of the Romans. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adam Elsheimer</a> has taken advantage of the biblical description, which describes the rain and cold, to portray a night scene: ‘And the barbarous people shewed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold’ (Acts 28: 2).

The islanders who saw that he had not been injured by the snake’s venom were convinced that he was a god.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The nakedness of some of the figures and the wildness of the landscape seems to evoke the primitive atmosphere Paul describes. Elsheimer has not paid the same attention to the anatomy of the figures here as he did to those of Christ and John the Baptist in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZ9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Baptism of Christ</a></span>.

The scene has been compared with paintings of shipwrecks by the Flemish painter Frederick van Valckenborch, whose dramatic nocturnal images Elsheimer may have seen in Frankfurt in the final years of the sixteenth century.</p></div>

Old and blind, Tobit had sent his son Tobias on a long journey to collect a debt on his behalf. Disguised as a man, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F78-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Raphael</a> – shown here with his large wings – joined the youth as his protector. Tobias is shown dragging an enormous fish across the ground, watched closely by Raphael. The angel had instructed the boy to catch a fish, the organs of which could be used to cast away a demon and restore Tobit’s sight. The huge fish clearly resisted being caught, injuring Tobias‘ arm, which is bound in a sling, in the process.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Our picture is one of several copies of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adam Elsheimer</a>’s original, now lost, which is known as the ’<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Large Tobias</span>‘ (there is a small version by the artist in Frankfurt). The copyist used copper, Elsheimer’s favoured support, for this version, and the plate is engraved with a coat of arms. The most faithful reproduction of the original is likely to be the engraving by the Flemish artist Hendrick Goudt, who owned the original from 1611. A version in the National Gallery of Denmark, Copenhagen, is closer in detail to the engraving; ours dates to a slightly later period, probably the mid-seventeenth century, at least 50 years after the original was made.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This scene gave the artist a reason to paint a rich variety of flora as well as a range of landscape views. A valley dotted with pasture and woods opens up on to a view of distant mountains. The view is partially covered by a leafy branch growing through the dense foliage of an exotic tree, which has the broad delicate flowers of a eucalyptus. The tree is one of the most unusual features of the painting as it only grew in its native Australia at the time. Its inclusion here may be explained by Elsheimer’s friendship with the botanist Dr Johann Faber, who, like Elsheimer, was living in Rome when the original version of this picture was made. The first known European landing in Australia was in 1606 and Faber may have learned about the exotic tree through his network of contacts. He may have been the painting’s patron or just provided its botanical references. The eucalyptus tree, like the poppies blocking Tobias’ path, had a medicinal use; their inclusion might refer to the healing powers of the fish.</p></div>

It’s most likely that the function of this picture was to showcase a range of the best objects in the city as a kind of aspirational ‘wish list’; an ideal collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paintings crowding the room show a wide range of subject matter: religious and secular, landscape, seascape, architectural interiors, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history pictures</a> and portraits.

The large print on the table is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ceres mocked by Peasants</span> by Goudt after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PJ7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adam Elsheimer</a>; the open folio beside it shows prints by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lucas van Leyden</a>. The table on the left displays scientific instruments – a pair of dividers, a compass, an astrolabe and a celestial globe – indicating that these art lovers were also interested in scientific learning. Other luxury items, including a Persian rug, blue and white porcelain, and coins and medals, complete the display.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture showcases the pleasure and erudition of art appreciation and collecting, and of scholarly pursuits such as astronomy. But the presence of a monkey – a traditional symbol of the foolishness of man’s endeavours – on the windowsill is perhaps a reminder of the frivolity and ultimate futility of hoarding beautiful and expensive objects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of picture showing collectors and visitors in real or largely imaginary settings was popular in Flanders in the seventeenth century. This example has in the past been attributed to Hans Jordaens the Younger or as a collaboration between Frans Francken II and Hieronymus Francken II, but neither attribution is convincing. It is likely that the picture is the work of two painters: a portrait specialist responsible for the figures, and an adept copyist for the architectural interior and copies of works of art. A clue as to the artist(s) lies in a picture of a similar composition in the collection of Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts de Belgique, Brussels, which is inscribed with initials that can be interpreted as ‘F/MW’ or ‘WM’ and ‘TF’ (in both, the ‘F’ most likely stands for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">fecit</span>, which is Latin for ‘he/she made it’).</p></div>

After the birth of Christ at Bethlehem, King Herod ordered all the male first-born children in the area to be executed – the so-called Massacre of the Innocents.

Although his travels are not well documented, it is known that in 1633–40 and 1641–7 he lived in the north of Italy and visited a number of cities including Bologna and Venice. There, he became familiar with the works of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Guercino</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Domenichino</a>. He completed his studies in Bologna in the studio of Francesco Albani, whose influence is evident in this painting, particularly in the figures.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For those living in Utrecht in the 1630s, this painting must have seemed like a window onto an exotic, tempting world. A crowd of naked women pose elegantly while they talk and bathe in a river. Behind them loom the overgrown tower and arches of a Roman ruin, while the bright morning sky glows behind the farmhouses, foothills and distant mountains of what would have been immediately recognisable as an Italian landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This fantasy world is a very long way from the level pastures, grey skies, neat gables and modest fashion of contemporary Holland. No wonder then that paintings like this proved so popular at the time: they offered a vision of the warm south and intellectual references to the lost world of the classics, as well as an excuse to enjoy female nudity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Several Dutch artists of the time travelled to train and study in Rome and profited from what they had seen and learnt when they came home, developing a lucrative market for paintings in this genre. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PST-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Poelenburgh</a> spent a decade in Italy from 1617 to 1627 and so was one of those who had experienced the light, landscapes and ruins for himself. On his return he became so highly regarded that he was invited to London to work for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles I</a>, before returning to Utrecht in 1641 just before the English Civil War.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Often paintings in this genre would represent a scene from a classical or biblical story. It’s possible that here van Poelenburgh meant to depict Diana bathing with her nymphs, but none of the objects that usually identify the goddess are present. Instead his allusion to the classical world is more general, relying on the poses adopted by the nudes to remind his audience of Roman statuary. Van Poelenburgh was considered a specialist in painting such figures – so much so that he was drafted in to help other artists by adding them to their landscapes. There’s an example of such a collaboration with the artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Both</a> (who studied with him in Rome) in our collection: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D93-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Landscape with the Judgement of Paris</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But there’s a question over how successful van Poelenburgh has been in depicting the figures. On an individual basis, the women are carefully painted. Look at shading of contours and muscles, and subtle changes of skin tone in the three figures in the foreground. But there’s something not quite natural about the way they interact: the poses seem to have been selected for individual effect, rather than a naturalistic grouping. Even more surprising is the woman sitting on a rock on the right-hand side – the one with her arm raised. She is apparently meant to be part of the group bathing in the distance, but she seems as close to us as the central figures. As a result she and the bathers with her look strangely like a group of miniature people.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There’s something magical about this enchanting picture, in its unearthly, misty colours, deep shadows, strange beasts. The musician fixing us with an enquiring eye is Orpheus. His story comes from one of the legends told by the Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a> in his book <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>. In it, Orpheus plays the lyre, but for some reason <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q92-0001-0000-0000.htm">Savery</a> has chosen to show him with a violin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Orpheus' skill was so great that all the beasts of the field and the birds of the air came to hear him play. Even the gods themselves listened, beguiled, and the poet tells how the trees moved from the forests to hear him, and to give him shade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rather than with music, Savery beguiles us with the animals he paints. Close to Orpheus a cockerel perches on a branch that’s almost touching a lion and a lioness. But they have no eyes for him, or for the grey-feathered pelican at Orpheus’ side, his glittering eye half closed as if in a dream. Behind them a buffalo turns towards the music, startling a stag. An ostrich cranes from the bushes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Savery’s idyllic landscape – part realistic, part otherworldly – ducks and geese and swans splash in a little stream. Above them, a magnificent horse and a camel look out at a gleaming white elephant. A stately crane displays its feathered crown where the stream tumbles down as a waterfall.  A fox lies near peaceful deer and comfortable cows. A wild boar noses in the bushes and a wolf sniffs the air next to another camel. Overhead the birds gather: a skein of geese, a gaudy parrot, long-legged storks. Orpheus’ music isn’t the only sound in the picture – the animals, the rushing stream, the wind in the trees, make a counterpoint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Savery had lived for a while at the court of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TXB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Emperor Rudolf II</a> in Prague where he drew the animals in the imperial menagerie, building up a stock of delicate, realistic studies. He made much use of them in the many pictures he painted of the Greek and Roman gods, goddesses and heroes, whose stories were so well loved in his day. He was also living when the Netherlands were under Spanish rule and had been fighting for independence for a long time. Savery’s picture may have been a disguised plea for peace: animals usually hostile to each other, living harmoniously under the influence of Orpheus’ music.</p></div>

The people in the scene, especially the young seamstress in the white turban, have a calm and dignified presence, similar to figures in classical art. This contrasts sharply with the chaotic schoolrooms often depicted by Dutch painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Adriaen van Ostade</a> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Steen</a>. The painting’s main theme appears to be education in a broad sense — the steady, patient effort required to learn a skill. This idea is reflected in the focused work of the seamstress and the practice of the musician at the far left.</p></div>
