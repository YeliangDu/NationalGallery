        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>Van Aelst depicts suspended partridges, one of them resting on a gold-trimmed green velvet hunter’s pouch that lies on a stone ledge. A fly has just landed on the partridge’s wing, a detail that serves to heighten the still life’s illusionistic qualities. But the picture is perhaps above all an exercise in painting different textures. Van Aelst has deliberately contrasted the softness of the feathers and the smooth velvet of the pouch with the hard and shiny surfaces of the pouch’s metal frame, the hunting horn above it and the cold stone of the marble ledge underneath, making sure we can be in no doubt about his superlative skills as a painter.</p><p>In the 18th century this painting belonged to William V, Prince of Orange and the last Stadtholder of the Dutch Republic.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A pyramid of flowers in full bloom. The cool, clear light, so pale it might even be moonlight, makes each flower glow against the grey wall. Full-blown roses, carnations and a snake’s head lily, jostle with wallflowers, snapdragons and lilac. At the top a stately iris crowns the arrangement, a fragile butterfly perched on its furled petal.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But it’s the three tulips that rise on a diagonal line through the centre of the picture that were the prize blooms. When van der Ast painted them, they were hugely expensive. A flower painting such as his was treasured because they were beautiful decorative additions to a wealthy household, but also because they demonstrated the owner’s interest in science.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Scientific exploration and discovery flourished in the Dutch Republic at this time. As in this painting, art and science often went hand in hand. Artists began to use newly invented microscopes to enable them to paint plants, insects and small animals in accurate detail – to see the markings and curled feeler of the peacock butterfly, the armoured shell of the cricket and the delicate legs of the spider exploring the yellow primrose. The wasp seems to hover in the air before zooming down to the fallen rose petals.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The first tulips had been brought in from Turkey as great and desirable wonders. Within months, the Dutch Republic was in the middle of ‘tulip mania’. A single bulb could cost the equivalent of thousands of pounds in today’s money. Each nurseryman aimed to grow a more exotic specimen than his neighbour. Striped petals or unusual colours were especially sought after and the great ambition – unfulfilled at the time – was to grow a black tulip.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Roses and tulips, lilac and snake’s head lilies, aren‘t all in bloom at the same time, so van der Ast would have made sketches and drawings of them at different points in the year, later incorporating them into the picture. Nor would the flowers have been cut – they were far too costly. They would have been left to grow and produce more of their kind for the following year.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Almost as expensive as the flowers were exotic shells. Brought from far-flung eastern countries by the merchant ships of the Dutch East India Company, the three in the painting would have been fetched from the sea bed by young men wearing no equipment, often diving to great depths to find them. In reality, the shells are unlikely to have been left on a shelf as they appear in the picture, but would have been locked away in a ’cabinet of curiosities‘ and shown to appreciative guests.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So van der Ast’s picture is a strange fiction. What he paints is so realistic that the objects are almost tangible. In one way they’re presented as scientific specimens, but in another as a precious, unfading vision of nature that could never have existed in reality.</p></div>

Such a person would have had an interest in, even a passion for, the many exotic plants being grown in the town’s new botanical gardens. So Bosschaert’s work is more than a lovely picture. He shows individual specimens of great value and scientific interest, and the buyer and their guests would have had their magnifying glasses out to indulge themselves in the ’science of looking'.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The stillness and sharp outlines of these magnificent flowers make them look almost artificial – and that’s exactly what this arrangement is, a magnificent piece of artifice. These flowers don’t come into bloom at the same time of the year, so the arrangement wouldn’t have been possible in the days before forced flowering and refrigeration.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q20-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ambrosius Bosschaert</a> would have made drawings and preliminary sketches of each flower and placed them into the picture as he worked. These specimens would not have been cut and shown in a vase; they would have remained in the ground for breeding or for an elegant garden display. This painting was meant to last, for a wealthy collector and connoisseur to admire long after the flowers had gone. The petals have a brilliant sheen, their jewel-like colours against the dark wall almost too bright to be taken as real. Bosschaert worked on a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1R-0008-0000-0000.htm">copper support</a> to allow the smoother application of paint than on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a>, enabling him to show intricate detail. He used layers of glazes to produce a brilliance that has remained virtually without fading for over 400 years.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The light gives equal value to each bloom and each bloom is painted with equal precision; they are displayed with little overlap so that they can be appreciated individually. A few smaller blossoms are hidden in the shadowy foliage and, along with the dark background, give the bouquet form and depth. This design shows the exotic blooms, which had been discovered and brought into the Dutch Republic from the East, to advantage. Four yellow tulips streaked with red ‘flames’ are placed in a cross shape as a basis for the whole balanced structure. At the time, tulips were the focus of an extraordinary phenomenon – tulip mania – when a single bulb changed hands for the equivalent of thousands of pounds. The most valued were the red-stained blooms we see in this picture, once thought to be the product of the horticultural skills of Dutch gardeners but actually the result of a condition known as ‘tulip breaking virus’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around the precious tulips – and only a little less costly and still exotic – roses, jonquils, carnations, fritillaries and a single blue iris are carefully placed into the vase. Above them all, at the peak of the bouquet, Madonna lilies rise like shining white trumpets (a tiny beetle making its way up the spotless petal perhaps makes them a touch less regal). Apple blossom, fallen from the vase, and the Red Admiral butterfly nearby capture our attention: perhaps they suggest that the breeding of exotic wonders began from such humble flowers, and was made possible with the help of living creatures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These aren‘t the only insects hiding among the leaves. A translucent brown butterfly perches behind the mop head of a pink carnation. A bee crawls into the mouth of a narcissus, in search of nectar. A caterpillar wriggles along the stem of a tulip, weighing it down, and a dragonfly with gauzy wings rests on the broad leaf of a cyclamen. Many seventeenth-century Dutch flower painters put these creatures into the painting, aware that they were representative of a huge upsurge of interest in the natural sciences.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bosschaert was no exception: he knew his market. The picture was probably made to impress one of the wealthy burghers of Middelburg, the prosperous town where he lived. Such a person would have had an interest in, even a passion for, the many exotic plants being grown in the town’s new botanical gardens. To us, the shells are decorative, but to Bosschaert’s client they would have been highly treasured curiosities. The insects would have been closely examined by the collector – and probably the artist himself – under one of the newly invented microscopes or other lenses becoming available in the Dutch Republic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The blue-and-white porcelain vase in which Bosschaert has placed his flowers – its delicate bird poised as if waiting to pounce on the hidden insects – was itself a rare and expensive object, and a work of art: a picture within a picture. Made in China during the reign of the emperor Wanli (1573–1620) at the end of the Ming dynasty, such blue-and-white porcelain was imported into the Dutch Republic where it fetched enormous prices at auction. It proved so popular that it led to the establishment of the Delft factories, where ceramics were made that are still sought after today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Successful artist though he was, it’s perhaps unlikely that Bosschaert was able to buy such an expensive treasure as the vase he portrays here. His brother-in-law and student, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Balthasar Van der Ast</a>, painted a picture featuring a similarly shaped vase – <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Flowers in a Wanli Vase</span> (Suermondt-Ludwig-Museum, Aachen). Did the two artists each own a vase, share the same one, or did they simply visit an owner and make sketches that, like the flowers, were also added into the pictures as they worked? The latter is perhaps more likely. However tempting it is to picture the brothers-in-law working in the same studio on opposite sides of one vase, it’s unlikely: Van der Ast’s painting is probably of a slightly later date.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bosschaert’s image – his flowers of great value and scientific interest – was more than a lovely picture: it was instructive and entertaining. It gave its owner and their guests the opportunity to demonstrate their sophisticated taste, and their knowledge and appreciation of the rare objects portrayed. And they would have had their magnifying glasses out to indulge themselves in the ’science of looking’.</p></div>

Here, stems and tendrils burst out from his bouquet, adding movement and dynamism to the composition.

Even the forms of the snail, <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/dutch-flowers-in-detail?viewPage=6">bumblebee</a> and cross spider on the edge of the plinth contribute to this effect.</p> <p>The bright colours of the flowers are expertly distributed. The red of the <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/dutch-flowers-in-detail?viewPage=1">tulip</a> and poppy at top right, for example, finds its counterpart in the red currants at lower left, while the rich ochre of the sunflower at top is balanced by the honeysuckle and ear of wheat at lower right.</p></div>

Van Huysum’s love for his work is perfectly shown by the nuances of green in younger and older leaves, as well as in the clear drops of water that are painted on the leaves.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Meticulously painted insects, flowers and berries are laid out on a plain creamy white surface without any overlap. Each specimen is carefully observed and identifiable. All of this might give us the idea that we are looking at a scientific illustration, but these insects appear very much alive: the seemingly casual arrangement, the light effects and the shadows cast give the objects a remarkably lifelike appearance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The black veined white butterfly balances on the leaf on a common hawthorn; a caterpillar and an earwig crawl along its woody sprig. A common blue butterfly sits on a different leaf, while another rests on one of the juicy red berries. Other insects – a hornet, a yellow pied hoverfly, a garden tiger moth, two more earwigs, a dung beetle and a fire bug – are arranged in rows at the top and bottom of the panel, contrasting with the more natural looking arrangement of the insects and plants in the middle.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>Ruysch’s flower paintings are full of movement. She combines minute detail with a sense of the bouquet as an organic whole. Here, blooms are on the verge of opening, the striped canary grass undulates and the honeysuckle seems to lean forward towards the viewer. These effects became more pronounced during the course of Ruysch’s long career.</p> <p>A magnificent <a href="https://www.nationalgallery.org.uk/whats-on/dutch-flowers-in-detail?viewPage=1">tulip</a> crowns the top of this colorful structure. The deep <a data-id="58995" href="/paintings/glossary/chiaroscuro" title="Chiaroscuro">chiaroscuro</a> recalls Ruysch’s earlier productions, but the main difference between this painting and the <a data-id="56679" href="/paintings/rachel-ruysch-flowers-in-a-vase" title="Rachel Ruysch | Flowers in a Vase">Flowers in a Vase</a> lies in the sense of profusion which is typical of the artist’s later works. In 1708 her exceptional talent was rewarded with a prestigious appointment as court painter to the Elector Palatine in Düsseldorf.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rachel Ruysch</a>’s elegant bouquet carries with it a breath of spring and summer. Peonies, viburnum, hawthorn, honeysuckle and columbine all bloom early in the year. But the burnt orange, russet and deep green of the Martagon lilies, the seed pod straggling over the edge of the stone shelf, the ripe wheat, and crisp, veined leaves near the end of their life turn thoughts towards summer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The light on the pale flowers sweeps upwards, making them luminous. Overhead, Ruysch’s delicate brushstrokes seem to skim over the surface of the picture, so that the dusky blue columbine seem as if they‘re drifting in the darkness. The plump green pistil at the centre of the large peony appears to anchor the flower as if to prevent it floating away upwards on the line of the wheat stem above. The honeysuckle hardly touches the stone shelf, and from a short distance the hawthorn becomes a series of white dots scattered against the black wall.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In spite of the apparent weightlessness of each bloom, Ruysch builds her painting on a series of strong lines slightly tipped on the diagonal. The first drops down from the columbine, through the snowball viburnum and the peony, to the grasshopper almost hidden by the honeysuckle. Another starts at the hawthorn and leads across to the crimson peony bud almost lost in the shadows. The many diagonals that cross the painting, together with the strong contrasts in light and colour, underpin Ruysch’s design, allowing her the freedom to make her flowers light and ephemeral without losing depth and form.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ruysch was one of the most successful flower painters of the late seventeenth and early eighteenth century. Her father was a botanist, anatomist and keeper of Amsterdam’s botanical garden – an important centre of the booming horticultural industry of the time, and a place of experiment. She had first-hand knowledge of the things she painted, from specimen blooms and new floral imports to the tiny ants, the grasshopper and acrobatic caterpillars busy among them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So why did she do what almost every other flower painter of the time did – show flowers that couldn’t be in bloom at the same time in a vase together, and how did she do it? She, as they all did, stored detailed sketches and drawings made when each flower was in bloom, and put them together in the finished image. But why is less clear – why not paint a picture of flowers in season?</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There may be no definite answer. Perhaps it was a tradition that grew up gradually. Perhaps it was a matter of taste – choosing flowers the artist or the client liked best. Perhaps it was an aesthetic need for different shapes, colours and textures only made possible by mixing flowers from both spring and summer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But the strong juxtaposition of spring and summer in Ruysch’s painting, and the fleeting impression she gives to the flowers, may suggest another reason. Perhaps the idea was simply to present the passing of the richness and diversity of both seasons as whole. The owner could explore the wonders of nature and science – which at that time preoccupied many people and which, in a deeply religious, Protestant country, many thought of as a gift from God.</p></div>
