        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The tranquillity of the Campagna – the countryside around Rome – stretches far into the distance under a soft golden light. Muleteers, who lived by transporting goods on the backs of their patient mules, move at a leisurely pace across the mountainous landscape. Its paths wind in and out of rocky outcrops down to the misty valley. The fine leaves of silver birch trees make a filigree pattern against the rolling clouds, tinged almost lemon yellow from the sun.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sun also catches the white sleeves, stockings and collars of two men as they stop for a rest and a chat in the shade close to us. One squats on a boulder. The other leans towards him, one leg hoisted up, his chin resting on his hands clasped on his stick. The tree close to us that rises up to disappear out of the picture and the dark shadows of the hillside on the right hem the two men in, so that the eye is drawn to them. Surrounded by their goats, these are the herdsmen in the title of the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Both</a> doesn‘t let us linger in the shade with the herdsmen. The upward slant of the single tree and its neighbouring sapling is echoed by the diagonal line of the path. It takes us from the standing herdsman’s hat up to the mule, to the tower in the distance, up to the cliff face of the hill beyond, before it runs down gently to the lake glinting in the sun. Both, who had spent three years of his youth in Rome, had made many sketches of the Italian countryside before he returned home to turn them into a series of romanticised pictures that were swept up by a Dutch audience, fascinated by scenes of a landscape and an atmosphere so different from their own.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But all is not quite as perfect as first appears. The mule behind the herdsmen carries heavy rolls hanging from a cumbersome wooden saddle. His head droops and his legs are painfully thin. His muleteer leans on a stick, struggling with the climb. Both places them against the light background of the sandy path to make sure these details can be seen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The fastest moving thing in the picture is the waterfall tumbling down the steep hillside on the right into a rocky pool where a man drinks the fresh, sparkling water from his hat. Both makes no attempt to make him an idealised classical figure: his arms are fairly muscular, but his torso is scrawny and the muscles slack. This is no Adonis of the Roman countryside but a peasant with a hard life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">So although Both paints the countryside as a romantic ideal, his peasants are not. He makes sure that for a discerning eye, the realities of life in the Italian hills are visible. This earned him criticism from Italian artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Salvator Rosa</a>, who disliked his portrayal of ’barbaric' peasants. But <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>, the great landscape painter who lived in Rome at the same time as Both, collaborated with him. His work served as an inspiration to Both during his stay in Rome and after his return to the Netherlands.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There’s a terrible irony at the heart of this painting which was made not by a single artist but by two working together. It appears to depict a moment of bliss: an idyllic landscape, painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan Both</a>, is suffused with the warm glow of a summer’s evening. On one side, goats rest peacefully among the trees, supervised by a watchful dog, while on the other two water nymphs quietly play in the shallows next to a river god. In the foreground, a group of elegantly poised nudes, added by Both’s collaborator <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PST-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cornelis van Poelenburgh</a>, catches the sunlight streaming through the riverside glade.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">But this is not a moment of peace and harmony. We are witnessing a tragic turning point in mythological history: the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET1-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judgement of Paris</a>. There are several versions of this in classical literature, but the one used here seems to have been drawn from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>’s Latin poem <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ars amatoria</span> (‘The Art of Love’). Ovid recounts that the god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a> asks a shepherd called Paris to judge which of three goddesses – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Juno</a> (Jupiter’s wife), <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Minerva</a> (goddess of wisdom) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a> (goddess of love) – is the most beautiful. Each goddess attempts to bribe him. Juno offers power, Minerva wisdom, while Venus promises him the love of Helen, the most beautiful woman in the world (even though Paris is already married to a mountain nymph called Oenone).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see Paris as he makes his fateful decision, handing Venus a golden apple which has been inscribed ‘to the fairest’. While she steps forward to accept her prize, her consort <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a> peeps out from under her robe. But the reaction of the other goddesses is telling. To the left, Minerva turns to catch our eye, while Juno seems to be raising her hand in alarm. They perhaps sense the tragic consequences of Paris’s choice. They know that he will soon discover that he is not just a simple shepherd but the abandoned son of Priam, King of Troy. When Helen, who is already married to a Greek king, is abducted by Paris with the help of Venus, it leads to the Trojan War and the destruction of Troy. Meanwhile, the shadowy woman in the background of the painting must be Oenone, turning anxiously to her father, who was a river god.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Poelenburgh’s reference for the group of figures was a well-known engraving designed over 100 years earlier by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael,</a> but he has adapted it to emphasise the drama of the moment – and perhaps the moral lesson implied. The fateful consequences of Paris’s preference for love over power and wealth are unlikely to have been lost on seventeenth-century Dutch viewers, who were benefitting from the fast-growing prosperity of a society built on commerce and trade. But no doubt they would also have appreciated the subject as an opportunity to enjoy the sensuality of the naked figures and the exoticism of the mountain landscape which frames them. Both van Poelenburgh and Both had studied in Italy before they returned to their hometown of Utrecht and were part of a group of Dutch artists who created a taste among their patrons for Italianate landscape painting.  </p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This full-length portrait of Armand-Jean du Plessis, duc de Richelieu (1585–1642) celebrates his powerful position within the French Church and government. He is dressed in the robe and skull cap of a cardinal, a position granted to him in 1622. His left hand lifts the robe to reveal a delicate layer of lace, also visible on his sleeves, beneath the great expanse of sumptuous red fabric. Richelieu is painted larger than life size, although his small head is out of proportion with his body. His tall and imposing appearance is accentuated by the block of colour of his robes and their generous folds. Around his neck hangs the cross of the Order of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, symbolised by a dove. On the right, a highly ornate chair with a deeply padded cushion signifies his high-ranking office as France’s Chief Minister, a position he held from 1624 until his death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Richelieu is shown standing, a pose usually seen in seventeenth-century portraits of secular figures such as kings and princes, in celebration of his outstanding achievements as a politician. Members of the clergy were traditionally shown seated. The richly embroidered golden curtain has been opened to reveal the terrace to the left and garden beyond which may be a view of the Cardinal’s château at Rueil, near Paris. Richelieu’s face, which stares out at the viewer, was repeated in Champaigne’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Triple Portrait of Cardinal de Richelieu</a></span> of around 1642, where it is flanked by two profile views.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of seven versions of the full-length portrait painted between 1633 and 1640 which show Richelieu in various settings. In each the cardinal either holds or wears a biretta, a cardinal’s hat. In this painting, and another in the Royal Collection, the artist places Richelieu in the same pose, holding the hat at arm’s length. The act of removing the hat embodies his dual role within the Church and state.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the most finished and carefully-painted version, one of only a few works that the artist signed. It may be the last version, painted in around 1640, which remained in the artist’s studio as a model for other portraits and was particularly admired by Richelieu. Yet it is unlikely that the artist would have signed a work that he kept, which suggests that this version was intended as a gift. One version was displayed in Richelieu’s Paris residence, the Palais-Cardinal, now part of the Palais Royale – an engraving made after the painting shows a Latin inscription has been added which is missing from our painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Champaigne spent most of his career working in Paris. He painted the other great French ministers of the seventeenth century: Cardinal Mazarin (1602–1661) in about 1653 (Musée Condé, Chantilly) and Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619–1683) in 1655 (Metropolitan Museum, New York).</p></div>

Kneeling in front of an open Bible, Mary glances towards the angel, her arms crossed and held against her chest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Joseph was the patron saint of workers, particularly carpenters and joiners. Scattered on the floor are his tools: a wooden mallet, chisel and axe. He is shown as a youthful rather than elderly man, as was more common. The chair, with its ornately carved arms and legs and deeply padded and tasselled cushion, on which Joseph rests his head, are at odds with the simplicity of his yellow cloak and sandals. His appearance signifies his humility, which the viewer would have been encouraged to follow. Champaigne’s figures were typically inspired by classical sculpture, and the drapery here appears solid and arranged in precise, large folds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This subject was painted frequently during the seventeenth century. It was promoted by, among others, Saint François de Sales (1567–1622) and Pope Gregory XV (1554–1623), who in 1621 introduced an annual Saint Joseph’s day (19 March).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like most of Champaigne’s paintings, this one is not signed or dated. A painting of this subject by the artist was mentioned in late eighteenth-century guidebooks as being in a chapel in the now demolished monastery of the Minims, near the Place Royale, Paris. Champaigne also painted this episode for the Carmelites of the Faubourg St-Jacques (the painting is now in the Louvre) and the Tuboeuf chapel in the church of the Oratory in the rue St-Honoré, both in Paris.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This triple portrait was intended as a model for a full-length statue of Armand-Jean du Plessis, duc de Richelieu (1585–1642). He wears the robe and skull cap of a cardinal, a position granted to him in 1622. On a blue ribbon hangs the Order of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Spirit</a>, symbolised by the dove just visible along the bottom edge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Richelieu became one of the most significant political figures in seventeenth-century Europe, and in 1624 he was appointed Chief Minister to the French King Louis XIII (1601–1643). The head is repeated in this painting in three different poses: facing forward and in profile turned to the left and the right. The central portrait relates to the artist’s full-length painting <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cardinal de Richelieu</a></span>, also in the National Gallery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was executed in Paris and in 1642 was sent to the Italian sculptor Francesco Mochi (1580–1654) in Rome. Mochi’s statue was formerly in the Château de La Meilleraye in Poitou, but in 1793, during the French Revolution, the head was removed and is now lost. The remaining statue is in the Musée du Pilori, Niort.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The commission for a full-length statue of Richelieu had originally been granted to the more renowned Italian sculptor, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P8C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gian Lorenzo Bernini</a>, but the project was abandoned in 1641 and a bust was made instead. Once in Paris, Bernini’s bust was criticised for its poor resemblance to Richelieu, and this was blamed on the inaccuracy of the painted profiles, supplied by an unknown painter, on which Bernini had based his work. Shortly after this, Cardinal Jules Mazarin (1602–1661), soon to become the Minister of France following Richelieu’s death, asked the celebrated Flemish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> to provide Bernini with a portrait on which to create the full statue (this artist had supplied Bernini with a portrait for his bust of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Charles I</a> of England). However, Van Dyck died before the commission was confirmed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Champaigne probably painted the central and right heads; an inscription above the latter reads: ‘this is the better one’. The rest of the painting was likely carried out by his workshop, as the costumes lack vitality and accuracy of detail. An earlier high-quality single profile of Richelieu by the artist is now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Strasbourg. Painted underneath it and invisible to the naked eye are several other portraits in varying profiles.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This warm, tranquil scene is bathed in sunlight. The sun sits low in the sky, and the clock on the building to the left records the time as five o‘clock. A coat of arms with three golden fleurs-de-lis (emblem of the French king) against a blue background can be seen above the clock and faintly on the ship’s flags to the right, suggesting this painting was intended for a French patron. Perhaps he is the figure dressed in a red cloak and carrying a sword who stands closest to the ship – a kneeling man could be pointing towards him or to the magnificent architecture on the opposite side of the painting. A group of well-dressed men to the left are in conversation while others work hard: they row passengers to the larger ships and secure a boat’s mooring. A musician sits beside his lute, and a woman and child watch those gathered at the port.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of a number of seaport scenes by Claude without a story taken from literature. This scene is mostly imaginary, although the architecture is based on sixteenth-century buildings in Rome. Claude’s aristocratic patrons were keen to link their names with the ancient grandeur of Rome. The most distant building combines features taken from the Villa Farnesina and Palazzo Senatorio; the four towers just visible in Claude’s painting are close in design to the campanile (bell-tower) of the palace. The ornate entrance to the building in the foreground is inspired by the gateway to the Farnese gardens, created by Cardinal Alessandro Farnese. On the balustrade of the building is a statue of Venus, the goddess of love. During the 1640s, when this work was painted, the statue belonged to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici family</a>, wealthy Italian bankers who were Claude’s patrons. Between these two buildings stands the Arch of Titus, an ancient Roman landmark.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such port scenes were popular in Rome during the seventeenth century, and Claude produced a number of them. He painted earlier works with a similar composition for Pope Urban VIII  (Alnwick Castle, Northumberland) and Angelo Giorio, who became a cardinal in 1643 and was the owner of the Villa Farnesina, which is referred to in this painting. Many of Claude’s paintings were later purchased by northern European aristocrats travelling around the Continent on what became known as the ’Grand Tour'  – an opportunity to see the great works of ancient and modern art, and to acquire examples for their own collections.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small painting beautifully evokes the lushness of the natural world. In classical art and literature, the shepherd or goatherd was a symbol of a lost age of innocence or a celebration of solitude away from worldly cares. Here, he rests against the base of a tree and turns his head towards us. He holds one hand to his mouth as if playing a flute that is just out of view. This image is derived from depictions of the classical hero <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Orpheus</a> charming the animals with his music. X-ray images reveal that the shepherd may have been wearing knee breeches originally, but Claude evidently changed his mind and clothed him in classical robes in the finished painting. A group of goats lie huddled together in front of him while others graze.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TV4-0001-0000-0000.htm">Filippo Baldinucci</a> (1624–1697), an Italian historian who knew Claude, believed the artist painted this work for himself and that ‘he used it every day to see the variety of trees and foliage’. The English landscape painter<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P58-0001-0000-0000.htm"> John Constable</a>, who loved Claude’s paintings, wrote that this scene ‘diffuses a life and breezy freshness into the recesses of trees, which makes it enchanting’. This shady woodland scene, positioned on the edge of a flat landscape, allows a glimpse of a river beyond. The serpentine tree trunks on the left draw our eye through to the glistening stream and blue mountains in the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This scene may resemble the park of the Villa Madama in Rome, home of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici family</a>, successful Italian bankers who were Claude’s patrons. Painted in around 1636/7, this early painting by Claude shows the extent of his growing talent. The precise delineation of the trees  is based on close observation of nature, and the layering of paint for the foliage creates a subtle contrast between light and shade.</p></div>

Procris gives her husband a spear, carried here by an attendant, and a magic dog. The painting is loosely based on a story in Ovid’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>. The title suggests that the pair are being reunited after a falling out caused by Procris’s jealousy, but Ovid does not mention Diana being at the reunion. Later in the story, Cephalus accidentally kills Procris with his spear. Perhaps Claude intended his painting to show an alternative happier ending, where Procris is brought back to life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The composition is inspired by Claude’s trips to the countryside near Rome. Large trees in the centre, painted with precise brushstrokes, frame the figures.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Many of Claude’s landscapes depict episodes from Ovid’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, a Latin poem of well-known stories and characters from Greek mythology. In this painting, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EK4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Diana</a>, goddess of hunting, carrying a bow and arrows, stands between the huntsman <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FW7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cephalus</a> and his wife Procris. Procris gives her husband a spear, carried here by an attendant, and a magic dog, which were given to her by Diana (book 7: 693–758). Claude has departed from Ovid’s narrative, which doesn't mention Diana being at the pair’s reunion following a falling out, caused by Procris’s jealousy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Later in Ovid’s story, Procris suspects her husband’s infidelity, follows him to a forest and hides when she hears him approach. Thinking she is a wild animal, Cephalus accidentally kills her with his spear (book 7: 796–865). Perhaps instead of depicting a reunion, Claude intended this painting to show a happier ending where Procris is brought back to life, although this is also not included in Ovid’s tale. This alternative ending was included in a famous Italian play performed during the fifteenth century and published many times. In any case, the painting would have acted as a warning to newly-weds of the dangers of jealousy and unfaithfulness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of the composition reflects the beauty of nature, inspired by Claude’s trips to the countryside near Rome, where he spent most of his life. The eye is led back and forth across the landscape in stages so that every detail can be appreciated. Large trees in the centre, painted with precise, brushstrokes, frame the figures. The different buildings and ruins in the landscape create a sense of scale and distance. The warm, pink sky highlights the subtle green tones and the contrast between light and shade on the foliage and foreground landscape. The reflections of the herdsman and his cattle in the pond’s surface are painted with meticulous attention to detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was painted in 1645 for an unknown patron in Paris. Claude returned to this subject many times during his career. Another episode from this story, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2I-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with the Death of Procris</a></span>, is attributed to his studio. The subject was popular with other artists in the seventeenth century. The Gallery owns Nicolas Poussin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cephalus and Aurora</a></span> (1630) and Peter Paul Ruben’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Aurora abducting Cephalus</a></span> (1636/7).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Claude’s painting and its pair, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Seaport</a></span>, were among the first works bought by the National Gallery in 1824, from the renowned collection of John Julius Angerstein.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted at the height of Claude’s success in 1646, this is one of several paintings by him that illustrate the story of Hagar. In the book of Genesis (21: 15–19), Hagar, an Egyptian servant girl, gives birth to a child by Abraham. She quarrels with his wife, Sarah, who is childless, and runs away. Here, Claude captures Hagar’s moment of suffering and despair: having run out of water in the wilderness, she has left her son, Ishmael, under a bush and is praying for God’s salvation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the Bible, this scene is set in the desert, but Claude depicts a verdant landscape. According to the story, an angel appears to Hagar and gives her water, but Claude shows a substantial river in the background. Pointing towards a distant town, the angel encourages Hagar to return to Sarah and Abraham. With the other hand, the angel points towards her, conveying God’s promise that Ishmael will become a great leader.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The angel’s clothing was originally painted yellow which is now barely visible. Instead we see the blue layer painted underneath. The angel’s wings have also lost some of their vibrant colour over time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Hagar was frequently portrayed in seventeenth-century Dutch art, particularly by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a> and his followers. In their paintings the landscape is less important and the figures of Hagar and the angel are usually shown at close range. In Claude’s painting, the landscape is the most dominant and engaging aspect of the composition, and draws our eye through to the distant buildings that convey a sense of distance and scale. This tranquil scene, bathed in hazy sunlight, celebrates the beauty of the countryside outside Rome, where Claude spent most of his life. A similar composition is included in Claude’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Liber Veritatis</span>, a collection of drawings made after his paintings, although this scene is placed in a horizontal format, there is no boat and the bridge has an additional arch.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The British landscape painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P58-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Constable</a> greatly admired this painting, which he saw when it was in the collection of his patron <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QXA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir George Beaumont</a>. The vertical format and use of trees to frame the foreground influenced Constable’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dedham Vale</span> painted in 1802 (Victoria and Albert Museum, London). George Beaumont is said to have enjoyed Claude’s painting so much that he took it with him wherever he travelled, and when he gave his collection to the National Gallery in 1826 he asked to keep it until his death.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of three imaginary seaport paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> owned by the National Gallery, and one that tells a story: the sorry tale of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0O-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Ursula</a>. According to the thirteenth-century <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, Ursula, a Christian princess from Britain or Brittany, made a holy pilgrimage to Rome with 11,000 virgins.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, Ursula, dressed in yellow and holding a flag with her emblem, watches her companions embark on their return voyage. They carry bows and arrows, weapons that represent their <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>. Later in the story, Ursula and her companions stop at Cologne in Germany, where the companions are all killed by the invading Huns, a nomadic race from Central Asia who conquered much of Europe in the fourth century. When Ursula refuses to marry the leader of the Huns she is shot with an arrow and dies.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The viewer’s gaze is directed towards Ursula and her attendants by the bows of the ships on the right, which point across the painting, and two aristocratic figures in the bottom left corner who witness the spectacle. The balance between the soft, hazy light, the sun low in the sky, and calm sea is typical of Claude’s seascapes, as are the highly detailed buildings, trees and ships, which are intended to frame the scene. Claude spent most of his life in Rome: the circular building with columns in the left foreground is based on the Tempietto di San Pietro in Montorio, a temple built on the spot of Saint Peter’s crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work was painted in 1641 for Fausto Poll (1581–1652), shortly before he became a cardinal. The position was granted to him by Pope Urban VIII (1568–1644), one of Claude’s most influential patrons. The palace building positioned slightly further back on the left resembles the Palazzo Cancellaria, the residence of the Pope’s nephew, Cardinal Francesco Barberini (1597–1679). The emblem of the Barberini family can be seen on the blue flags of the ships placed in the centre, which are being admired by two figures in the middle distance. The Barberini family wielded immense power and influence in seventeenth-century Rome. They were avid collectors of paintings and patrons of Claude.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This story was rarely painted in the seventeenth century but was a popular subject during the sixteenth century. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> Martyrdom of Saint Ursula</span>, now in the Palazzo Zevallos Stigliano, Naples, shows Ursula with an arrow impaled in her chest and surrounded by the Hun soldiers. The authenticity of her legend was questioned during the twentieth century resulting in her feast of 21 October being removed from the Roman Catholic Liturgical Calendar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work, along with several others by Claude, was among the first to be bought by the Gallery in 1824, from the prestigious collection of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T0D-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Julius Angerstein</a> (1735–1823).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Threatened with marriage to a monster <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Psyche</a>, a mortal, is blown away by the West Wind. She awakens near a magical palace and falls in love with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>. He makes Psyche promise not to look at his divine face, but she breaks this promise and Cupid abandons her. The story is told in Books IV to VI of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, also known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Golden Ass</span>, written by Apuleius.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Psyche sits in the foreground, deep in thought or melancholy. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> may have based this figure on an illustration in Apileius' <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>. However, she looks similar to the figure representing <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mediation</span> in a seventeenth-century French edition of Cesare Ripa’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Iconologia</span>, a book where ideas are shown through images of people with particular expressions and attributes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Claude perhaps shows the moment before Psyche meets Cupid rather than when he leaves her. However, the figure’s pose does not match the written story, which says she ‘lay flat upon the ground and watched her husband’s flight as far as her sight enabled her’ and then in despair, ‘threw herself over the edge of a nearby river’. Alternatively, this scene may represent another moment in the narrative when Psyche is alone: when her two jealous sisters leave after persuading her to murder Cupid. The two figures in the boat on the right are perhaps her sisters. They also appear in the painting’s pair <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Landscape with Psyche saved from drowning</span>, now in the Wallraf-Richartz Museum, Cologne.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work was painted in 1664 for Lorenzo Onofrio Colonna (1637–1689) who had recently married Maria Mancini (1639–1715). Like Psyche, she had come from the west – from France to Rome. Yet the painting’s subject is not a celebratory one but rather alludes to marital difficulties. Ironically, the relationship between Colonna and Mancini was breaking down by 1665, the year before Claude completed both paintings. However, it is unlikely that Claude would have deliberately painted a picture that related so negatively to the couple’s marriage. Neither painting remained in Colonna’s collection by 1679; perhaps he no longer liked the subjects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, Cupid’s enchanted castle combines various architectural styles seen by Claude in and around Rome with imaginary examples: the grand exterior of a townhouse or palazzo is attached to circular towers and ruins associated with military fortification. These buildings may reflect the Colonna family’s long-standing profession as builders in Rome. The imposing rocky hillside and sheltered seaside cove shows Claude’s imagination and skill at conveying perspective and scale. The isolated landscape and cool colouring adds to the solemn tone.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A group gathers around a manger to adore the newborn <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>.

On the left are two young boys and an old, barefooted man: they are the shepherds mentioned in the Gospel of Luke (2: 8–20). The boy wearing a hat and one of the angels appear to have seen or heard something outside the painting, possibly the arrival of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene takes place in the ruins of a classical building rather than in the stable described in the Bible. Such ruins were often used in depictions of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a> to symbolise the decline of the old pagan world with the rise of Christianity. The chipped marble of the columns and the vines growing over the stone heighten the sense of the buildings’ disrepair. The arch both protects the figures and leads the eye towards a distant building and a delicately painted rural landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has employed a sumptuous palette, contrasting the bold red of the Virgin’s dress with the delicate pink and green hues of the angels’ robes. The humble setting is amplified by the bare ground and the ruins’ pale, earthy tones. Strong shadows in the foreground draw our attention towards the bright, radiant light falling on the Christ Child, as well as to his delicate halo. Further contrasts are found between the beautiful, idealised Virgin and the more naturalistic shepherd, whose tattered clothes and dirty, wrinkled feet remind us of his poverty. This naturalism became extremely popular in the early seventeenth century through the works of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P3P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Caravaggio</a>; the idea to silhouette the donkey against the wall to the right may have its origins in the work of Orazio Gentileschi, a follower of Caravaggio who worked in Paris. A major pentimento is visible just above the wings of the angel in green where the Virgin’s head was originally painted in an earlier version of the composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A painting of this size would have been made for private devotion in someone’s home, not for a church. It combines refined elegance with carefully observed naturalistic detail: compare, for example, the beautiful, idealised Virgin with the older shepherd’s tattered clothes and dirty, wrinkled feet. Although we aren’t sure which of the three <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Le Nain brothers</a> – Antoine, Louis and Mathieu – painted the picture, the complexity of the subject and the scale of the composition make it one of the greatest produced by them.</p></div>

The costumes, with their broad collars, suggest a date of the late 1640s or early 1650s, but if this is a portrait of the brothers it cannot be later than 1648 – the year Louis and Antoine died. Their deaths may explain why the painting was not completed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This unfinished work gives us an insight into the artist’s painting process. The bodies, limbs and clothing were initially sketched in with rough brown outlines. The face of the man on the right reflects an earlier painting stage, as shown by his sketchy appearance and pale complexion. Detail and texture was added later, as can be seen in the delicate line of buttons on the sleeve of the man on the left, the shimmery satin fabric and the wavy hair. There are different levels of finish in the painting: the artist seemingly worked from left to right, painting faces first then the lovely jacket with its satin sheen, but not filling in the details of the other figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When the National Gallery acquired this work it was thought to be by a follower of the Le Nain brothers. It was previously called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Trio of Geometers</span> because it had been <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQO-0008-0000-0000.htm">overpainted</a>, and geometrical instruments and a globe had been added in the right foreground. Cleaning in 1968 removed these items and revealed that the picture is unfinished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture reveals part of an earlier composition: the head of a boy on the right and the colourful blue and yellow drapery emerged when the overpaint was removed. The results of the cleaning meant that the painting is now thought to be a genuine Le Nain. X-ray images have also revealed that this scene was painted over the portrait of a seated woman. It was common for canvases to be reused in the brothers' studio. .</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The National Gallery owns several other works attributed to the brothers: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Shepherds</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GLT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Four Figures at a Table</a></span>.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Le Sueur shows us a moment described in the Gospel of John, when Christ speaks to his mother, the Virgin Mary, and his disciple, Saint John the Evangelist, just before he dies. Opposite them kneels Mary Magdalene, her hands clasped together in prayer. Their expressions, mouths slightly open and eyes widened in disbelief as they stare up at Christ, convey tension and grief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Behind them, darkening clouds add to the sombre mood. A strong light comes from the right, revealing the soft, pale tones of Christ’s body and the vibrancy of the figures' robes. Le Sueur creates dramatic effect by placing the figures within a narrow space, with the viewer directly in front of the Cross and level with them.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This composition was inspired by an earlier version created in Simon Vouet’s (1590–1649) studio, which is where Le Sueur had received his training. Le Sueur was developing his own style, and the way he experiments with facial expression and hand gestures to convey emotion in this painting distinguishes him from his master.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Le Sueur</a> shows us a moment described in the Gospel of John, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> speaks to his mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, and his disciple, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a>, just before he dies (John 19: 25–30). Opposite Mary and Saint John kneels <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>, her hands clasped together in prayer. Their faces, mouths slightly open and eyes widened as they stare up at Christ, express their disbelief and grief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Darkening clouds add to the sombre mood. The pale tones of Christ’s body contrast starkly with the vibrancy of the Virgin’s traditional blue robe and Mary Magdalene’s shimmering golden clothing, revealed by the strong light falling from the right. Despite the small size of the painting, Le Sueur creates a dramatic effect by placing the figures within a narrow space, with a rocky slope to one side. We are included in the scene, placed directly in front of the Cross and level with the figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Le Sueur was probably inspired by a painting on this subject by the studio of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PYW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Simon Vouet</a>, now in the Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg. Le Sueur had started working as one of Vouet’s principal assistants in 1631, and stayed with him for over ten years. Both paintings include an imaginary view of Jerusalem in the distance, but there are significant differences in the position and gestures of Saint John and Mary Magdalene. Le Sueur was developing his own style, and the way he experiments with facial expression and hand gestures to convey emotion in this composition distinguishes him from his master.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another painting of this subject in the Louvre, formerly attributed to Le Sueur and now considered the work of Vouet’s studio, has a similar composition. This one is larger in size, there is no inscription on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPS-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartellino</a></span> fixed to the Cross and the position of the Virgin’s head has changed. Both were probably painted during the early 1640s. During this time, Le Sueur began studying the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nicolas Poussin</a> and developed a new way of painting figures that was more sculptural, but retained his characteristic refined colours.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don't know the original location and owner of the National Gallery’s painting. It was probably intended to be positioned in a chapel or private room in the home to aid prayer. During the early nineteenth century, it was placed in the Bar Convent chapel in York.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At this wild party, men and women dance around a term (a carved bust of a bearded and horned man). This is traditionally identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXA-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pan</a>, god of woods and fields, flocks and herds. The Greek word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pan</span> means ‘all’, conveying his power over the earthly world and the other gods. During the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a>, Pan came to personify lust.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, however, we cannot see Pan’s usual attributes: a shepherd’s crook and musical pipes (they are shown in Poussin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFR-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Triumph of Pan</a></span>). Their absence supports the idea that the statue could be Priapus, god of gardens and fertility, who wears floral garlands and exposes his genitalia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These revellers are often seen in classical, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM8-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastoral</a> scenes depicting the rites of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a>, the god of wine. The grapes and dancing suggest that this is a Bacchic festival, like those held during ancient Roman times to encourage a successful harvest. In art and literature, partygoers enjoy excessive drinking and fulfil their sexual desires, suggested here by the empty vessels and exposed skin.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The female dancer on the left with outflung hair squeezes juice from a bunch of grapes into a small dish held by a chubby child.<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Poussin</a> has cleverly mirrored the linked arms of the dancers in the overlapping tree trunks behind them. On the right, a woman has fallen to the ground and stretches out her hand for help as she is drawn into the embrace of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a> (a mythological figure known for lustful behaviour). The women could be nymphs or maenads, the wild female followers of Bacchus who were often identified by tambourines and loose draperies. The boldly coloured fabrics worn by the dancers contrast with the women’s porcelain complexions and the ruddy skin of the men and satyr.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin studied every aspect of the classical past, and he aimed to recreate that world for his educated, aristocratic patrons. The muscular bodies and crisp drapery folds recall ancient sculptures. Despite the frantic activity, the dancers have been carefully posed in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze-like</a> composition, like the figures on ancient stone coffins, known as sarcophagi.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was made in around 1632, and the figures have a more solid appearance than those in some of Poussin’s earlier pictures of Bacchic subjects, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Nymph with Satyrs</a></span>, painted six years earlier. Poussin also used this group of dancers in reverse in a later picture, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFK-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Adoration of the Golden Calf</a></span>. The landscape here was inspired by Poussin’s knowledge of sixteenth-century Venetian paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> in Roman collections.</p></div>

Later, when they are reunited, Cephalus and Procris each doubt the fidelity of the other. Their story ends tragically with Cephalus accidentally killing his wife with a magic spear.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the left, the reclining figure leaning on an urn is probably Oceanus, the father of all river gods. Beside him is the winged horse Pegasus. In the background, the woman wearing a wreath of corn and holding flowers could be Terra, a goddess associated with the awakening earth.

These figures relate to Aurora as the goddess of dawn and times of the day. Some of the figures may represent the Four Elements – Apollo as Fire, the reclining goddess as Earth, Pegasus as Air and Oceanus as Water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This melancholic scene is conveyed through the clever use of pose and expression to convey emotion: this is a moment of great regret for Cephalus and sorrow for Aurora. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a> made several changes to the composition while painting and was clearly changing his mind about which details to include where. Originally there were two additional trees to the left and a chariot where we now see a reclining goddess, and the position of the head of the putto holding Procris’s portrait has been altered.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pose of Cephalus is similar to that of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a> in Titian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus and Ariadne</a></span> and the figure of Oceanus may be derived from Tithonus in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Agostino Carracci</a>’s fresco of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Cephalus and Aurora</span> in the Palazzo Farnese in Rome, which Poussin would have known.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject was popular with other artists in the seventeenth century.

Commissioned by his friend and patron, the Roman antiquarian and collector Cassiano dal Pozzo (1588–1657), Poussin depicted the seven rites of the Catholic Church: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baptism, Penance, Eucharist, Confirmation, Marriage, Ordination</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Extreme Unction</span>. The series was celebrated for its beauty, innovation, and the careful depiction of these practices in their historic context. It was so successful that a second suite of sacraments was commissioned from Poussin in the late 1640s by the French collector, Paul Fréart de Chantelou (1609–1694).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin represents the sacrament of Eucharist with a depiction of the candlelit <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FS8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Last Supper</a>. In this highly symmetrical composition, Christ holds the bread and cup of wine in one hand and raises the other in blessing. He is seated at a Roman <span class="dokuwiki_italic">triclinium</span> (padded couch), with six disciples on either side. Judas is probably seated second from the left, the only disciple who does not turn towards Christ. Although all four Gospels recount the Last Supper, Poussin has followed that described in John 13:23, in which John the Evangelist rests against Christ’s side. The figures in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Eucharist</span> are smaller than in other paintings from the first series of sacraments, with much of the canvas given over to the grand architectural setting. In the background, a shadowy figure retreats through an open door, creating a sense of movement in the otherwise still scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The most striking feature of this painting is its dramatic use of light, which comes from three sources: the two flames of the double-wicked lamp above Christ’s head and the candle on the stool in the centre left foreground. With these multiple light sources, Poussin sets in motion a complex play of shadow projection, with elements casting two or even three shadows. The finely turned leg of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">triclinium</span> in the left foreground, for example, has minute highlights and two distinct areas of shadow. Poussin appears to have devised this highly individual lighting arrangement after reading a manuscript owned by dal Pozzo and based on a lost treatise by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo da Vinci</a> (1452–1519). It imbues the painting with a hushed, dramatic atmosphere.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Eucharist</span> has been executed with Poussin’s characteristic precision. A pinpoint hole can easily be made out in the fanlight window above Christ’s head, used by the artist to plot the picture’s perspective. In the foreground, the grid of floor tiles has been rigorously planned, and may suggest the use of Poussin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">grande machine</span>: a large box, rather like a toy theatre, into which Poussin placed wax figurines to devise and stage his compositions. Poussin has paid a great deal of attention to the rhythm of the disciples’ hands across the picture, several of which are held up to receive Christ’s blessing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1785, the first series of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Seven Sacraments</span> was brought to Britain, where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sir Joshua Reynolds</a>, founding President of the Royal Academy, declared ‘The Poussins are a real national object.’ Six paintings from the series survive, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Penance</span> having been destroyed by fire in 1816. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baptism</span> was acquired by the National Gallery of Art, Washington DC. in 1939; <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ordination</span> by the Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth in 2011; and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Extreme Unction</span> by The Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge in 2013. In 2023, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Confirmation</span> was sold abroad. Acquired by the National Gallery in 2024, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Eucharist</span> now represents this major commission in the national collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A man has been crushed by a snake and lies dead beside a pond: his body is limp and his skin putrid with a greenish-grey appearance. A man and woman react with fear and surprise, yet there’s something still and static about their gestures and poses. The way the landscape is constructed reveals the drama in stages: the running man sees the dead man and the snake, the woman sees only the fleeing man and the fishermen in the distance see only her. Trees are used to frame the action and the zigzag placement of the people in the landscape and the alternating areas of light and shade lead our eye deeper into the distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is unlikely that this scene relates to a story from ancient mythology: several episodes in Apuleius’s tales known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Metamorposes</span> include snakes killing people but the details do not match the scene we see here. It has also been suggested that this painting shows the death of Opheltes taken from Greek mythology, but Opheltes was a child when attacked by a snake, and here we see a man.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The theme of this painting was probably inspired by the notorious snake-infested area of Fondi, south-east of Rome, and close to the cities of Terracina and Amyclae, which may be the ones shown in the background. However, during the seventeenth century Fondi was abandoned, and in the painting we can see many people in the landscape, so the setting is at least partly imaginary. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a> spent most of his career in Rome, and in 1647 possibly visited this place with Jean Pointel, the patron for whom he painted this picture. Later sources imply that Poussin had heard of or witnessed an actual event when a man was killed by a snake, and this gave him the idea for the painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pointel, a Parisian merchant, was one of Poussin’s most prestigious patrons. He also owned the artist’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Landscape with Orpheus and Eurydice</span>, now in the Louvre, Paris, which shows Eurydice being killed by a snake. Both of Pointel’s paintings show scenes of sudden death in peaceful countryside.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The theme of the snake in the grass also alludes to the whims of fortune. This painting shows the reversals of fortune or luck created by an encounter with a dangerous animal. To the left of the seated woman, and barely visible, three people recline in the landscape and are unknowingly risking their lives.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin’s composition is inspired by art from classical antiquity, which is particularly evident in the somewhat rigid pose of the man in blue. The condition of the paint surface is very poor and the colours have darkened over time, which makes it difficult for us to appreciate the painting’s original appearance. Despite this, Poussin’s skill can be seen in the reflection of buildings in the lake and the overlapping brushstrokes and varied green tones of the foliage in the different types of tree.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A sandy path meanders through a landscape of dunes towards distant hills and mountains. An old man in blue with his back towards us occupies the foreground, a sack and water bottle lying beside him on the ground. He seems to be watching a young man on the other side of the path who bends to scoop water from a pool with a pottery shard.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Trees frame the path which draws us into the scene and leads our eyes towards the distance. The small town and several people in the background are roughly sketched, conveyed using simple dots of paint. The buildings and people in the background, and the dappled areas of light and shade, evoke the Roman Campagna, in which Poussin often travelled to make studies. Blue mountains merge with the cloudy sky at dusk, another technique to create a feeling of distance: far-off mountain ranges seem blue because distance alters the way colours appear to us. The brown-green tones of the pond are carried through into the landscape beyond. Poussin attempts to create the reflection of the trees on the water’s surface, although this lacks skill and reflects the early stage of his career. The edges of the leaves and branches catch the sunlight, and overlapping brushstrokes convey their different types.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin’s work was also inspired by art from classical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">antiquity</a>. The symmetry of the leaning trees, the blue sky and sandy landscape taking up equal areas and the central path give the composition order and balance. The men’s muscular and idealised physiques recall antique statuary.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is not based on any known story, although it loosely echoes the life of the Greek Cynic philosopher Diogenes (about 400–325 BC) who advocated a life without possessions and luxury: he threw away his cup on seeing a young boy use his hands to drink water. It might also hint at the philosophy of the Stoics, who thought that in order to become a good person you had to live according to certain virtues, including wisdom, courage, justice and moderation. These themes were revived in the seventeenth century and became popular with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a> and his patrons.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin painted this work for one of his most important patrons, Cassiano dal Pozzo, and around the same time as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with travellers resting</a></span>. They are among Poussin’s earliest landscape paintings, made in the late 1630s. On the back of the canvas of both paintings are labels indicating that in 1739 Cosimo Antonio dal Pozzo gave the pictures to his daughter Maria Laura. These works were probably not intended to be displayed as a pair, but both include a person sitting, leg outstretched, in the foreground, and the paths in each painting recede in opposite directions.</p></div>

Here, he tentatively created an ideal landscape by building up contrasting areas of dark and light and by highlighting these areas with the three figures.

Although the paintings have always been together in the same collections, and both show three figures in a landscape, they were probably not made as pendants to be hung together, and may have been painted a year or two apart.</p></div>

The woman’s pale skin, soft curves and rosy cheeks contrast with the tanned skins and muscular bodies of the satyrs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This erotic painting was previously been thought to depict the story of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jupiter</a> and the nymph Antiope. According to Roman mythology, in one of his earthly adventures Jupiter disguised himself as a satyr, crept up on the nymph Antiope and ravished her. But in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a>’s version of the story Antiope is not asleep (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, VI: 110-11).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Alternatively, the nymph could be <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, goddess of love, but we cannot see any of her attributes in this painting. An earlier version of this subject (now in the Kunsthaus, Zürich) painted by Poussin shows a pair of white doves, which are associated with Venus and symbolise lust. The child could be Venus' son, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, whose quiver, or bag, holding his arrows hangs in the tree above him in the Zürich picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Paintings of female nudes were made popular by the sixteenth-century Italian artists who were admired by Poussin and his patrons. Poussin may well have been inspired by their work: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Agostino Carracci’s</a> print of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Satyr and Nymph</span> shows the satyr behind the tree masturbating, which may also be happening in Poussin’s painting. In both compositions, the tree in front of the satyr has a phallic appearance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painted in around 1627, this is an early example of Poussin’s work. He was a young painter living in Rome without regular patronage, and this may have led him to paint erotic subjects that appealed to a wide audience and could be easily sold. An X-ray image made by the National Gallery shows that the canvas was used for different drawings that do not relate to the final painting, and we know that Poussin experimented with compositions before deciding which one to paint. Our picture has an unfinished look, particularly in the sketchy appearance of the tree trunk and foliage, although the bodies are more finished.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Poussin’s work had an impact on future generations of artists: William Etty’s (1787–1849) <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Sleeping Nymph and Satyr</span>, painted in 1828 and now in the Royal Academy in London, is based on the painting we see here or the version in Zürich</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A large gathering of Israelites worship a life-size statue of a golden calf, or what is actually a golden bull, that represents the Egyptian bull-god Apis. They have decided to worship a different, pagan god while their leader Moses has been away on Mount Sinai collecting the stone tablets on which God has written the Ten Commandments, his laws on how to live properly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Aaron, dressed here in a white cloak, has melted down gold earrings to create the statue. In the top left corner, Moses returns with his successor Joshua, and in his anger at seeing the calf smashes the stone tablets (Exodus 32: 19).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The worshippers dance energetically and we follow their pointed hands across the canvas, which helps to tell the story. Our eye is drawn to the group of kneeling figures on the right, who gaze and point towards the altar, and to the group of dancers on the left with Moses behind them. These two groups are connected by the dancing girl who links hands with another dancer and holds a small bunch of white flowers. The group of tents on the right show that worshippers have travelled a long way to reach this shrine. Several people in the middle distance look in shock at what Moses is doing. A bright light shines onto the scene from our direction; an elderly man in front of the tents shields his eyes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture shows Poussin’s interest in classical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">antiquity</a>: the muscular physique of the worshippers, the flowing drapery and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>-like arrangement of the dancers are inspired by antique sculpture. Groups of dancers at pagan festivals are often found on ancient Greek vases. The boldly coloured clothing and golden sky reflect the influence of sixteenth-century Venetian painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a>. Poussin spent his time in Italy studying both classical art and more recent works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The positions of Moses and Joshua and the people in the foreground is similar to a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> of the same subject painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> and his studio in around 1518/19 for the loggia (open-sided gallery or room) of the Papal Palace in the Vatican.

The stone archway frames an earlier episode: the same shepherds fall over in surprise as an angel appear in the clouds to announce Christ’s birth to them (Luke 2: 8–14).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Following an old tradition in painting, Poussin includes both parts of the story and paints them as if they are happening at the same time. The architecture separates the foreground scene from the activity in the background. The stable is built within the ruins of a classical building with columns that frame the scene, symbolising the collapse of paganism and the triumph of Christianity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The shepherds and women eagerly await their turn to meet the baby Jesus. Their poses and gestures reveal their excitement: one shepherd prays while another moves towards him and is about to kneel, and a woman holds her hands against her chest. Behind them, two men point towards the foreground scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young lady enters the scene carrying a ‘birth tray’ of fruits as a present to the new mother – these were popular in Italy, and appear in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> paintings of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a>. She hurries forwards, her flamboyant drapery billowing behind her as she moves. Its vivid blue, and that of Mary’s clothing, stands out against the men’s ruddy skin and the copper stone of the buildings. Poussin’s interest in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">classical antiquity</a> is clear in the rigid drapery folds and the shepherds‘ muscular appearance, which are based on ancient statues. This scene includes many intricate details: Christ’s straw bed, the cherubs’ flowers and each feather of their wings, and a variety of fruit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This subject was painted frequently during the seventeenth century.

However, it is not mentioned in any guidebooks to Rome that describe the Pope’s houses and collection. The Virgin and angel are carefully arranged on the parapet as if the painting were intended to be part of a building. Poussin’s patron and mentor Cassiano dal Pozzo died in 1657, and was buried in Santa Maria sopra Minerva in Rome. This work could have been painted as a memorial for his tomb.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The 1650s represent Poussin’s late career, when he had developed a personal style inspired by his study of classical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">antiquity</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> art.

It was painted in around 1628, at a time when Poussin was living in Rome and was popular with the prominent art collectors Cardinal Francesco Barberini and Cassiano dal Pozzo.

The blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> used for the woman’s clothing has lost its vitality and at some point a girdle of vine leaves was added to the standing man, which has now been partially removed.</p></div>

Pan’s attributes are the shepherd’s crook and musical pipes, which we see here in the foreground. Priapus is often shown wearing the floral garlands that adorn this statue, and with exposed genitalia that represent fertility.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pan and Priapus were followers of the mischievous god of wine <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a>. This scene celebrates the popular Roman pagan tradition of Bacchanalian festivals that were devoted to Bacchus and aimed to ensure a good harvest. According to literary accounts these wild parties and banquets involved lots of sex and alcohol. Animals, like the ones we see here, were often sacrificed during these events and the garlands of flowers were made as offerings.

The musical instruments and masks in the foreground allude to the festivals‘ dramatic plays. The figures’ animated gestures and expressions invite us to join the party. The warmth of this scene is conveyed by the dusky sky and colourful draperies, now faded although once vibrant.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture shows Poussin’s interest in Classical antiquity: the muscular figures and flowing drapery recall ancient statues, and the foreground vases are inspired by painted Greek pottery. The tranquil landscape with distant blue mountains may represent Pan’s native land of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3D-0008-0000-0000.htm">Arcadia</a> in Greece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a> drew upon the art he studied in Rome: his most important patron, Cassiano dal Pozzo, owned drawings of an ancient stone sarcophagus decorated with images of Pan in the Villa Doria-Pamphili in Rome. Here, the people and trees evenly placed across the painting imitate images on ancient relief sculpture. Poussin’s composition is also inspired by the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> artists, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Feast of the Gods</span> (National Gallery of Art, Washington) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Andrians</span> (Prado, Madrid).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was commissioned in 1636 by Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642), the powerful French minister, for his château in Poitou. Its companions, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Triumph of Bacchus</span> (now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art, Kansas City) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EU0-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Triumph of Silenus</a></span> (also in the National Gallery) were painted at around the same time and hung in the same room, the Cabinet du Roi. At some point before 1741 all three bacchanalian scenes were replaced with copies (now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tours) and taken to England.</p></div>

Silenus, a naked old man with a bald head, sits slumped on a throne to the left, supported by two men. Too drunk to stand, he balances one leg precariously on a tiger. He is surrounded by revellers who remove their clothing and enjoy the festivities. The flute player stares towards us, inviting us to join the party. To the right, a shepherd seduces a female satyr, who symbolises lust. Behind them, two centaurs with human bodies and horses' legs attack an ass. The composition is complex and sophisticated, with trees and rocky cliffs framing the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was one of three bacchanalian scenes Poussin painted for the powerful French minister, Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642). The painting’s uneven finish, with some figures quite coarsely executed but objects in the foreground rendered meticulously, had led some scholars to consider this a copy after a lost work by Poussin. Recent conservation treatment and technical analysis point instead to this being Poussin’s original.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This playful scene celebrates <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Silenus</a>, companion to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a>, the Roman god of wine and drunkenness. Silenus, a naked old man with a bald head, sits slumped on a throne to the left, supported by two men. He rests his hand on a jug of wine. Too drunk to stand, he balances one leg precariously on a tiger, although he is often shown in paintings riding an ass. The garland at Silenus‘ feet and the wreath being lowered onto his head are mentioned in Virgil’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Eclogues</span>, a series of poems on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM8-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastoral</a> themes (book VI, 1:16). They were worn during Roman festivals and banquets devoted to Bacchus.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The revellers remove their clothes and enjoy the festivities as they drink and dance. The flute player in the centre stares towards us, inviting us to join the party. On the right, a shepherd seduces a female <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a>, who symbolises lust. In the background, two centaurs with human bodies and horses’ legs attack an ass. The idealised and muscular physique of the men reveals Poussin’s study of statues from classical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">antiquity</a>. The composition is complex and sophisticated, with trees and rocky cliffs framing the scene. The faded colouring of the draperies hanging in the trees was once vibrant.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The people and setting are similar to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Andrians</span> (Prado, Madrid) which Poussin may have seen in Rome. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>-like composition, with the people and trees evenly placed across the painting, is inspired by images on ancient Roman stone coffins, known as sarcophagi.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around 1636 Poussin painted three bacchanalian scenes for the home of the powerful French minister, Cardinal de Richelieu (1585–1642): a scene depicting Silenus, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Triumph of Pan</span> (in the National Gallery, London) and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Triumph of Bacchus</span> (Nelson-Atkins Museum, Kansas City).  At some point before 1741 all three of Poussin’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Triumphs</span> were replaced with copies (now in the Musée des Beaux-Arts, Tours). Despite the copy after Richelieu’s Silenus painting being identical in design to this work, most scholars since the mid-twentieth century have cast doubts over the latter’s attribution to Poussin. This was, in part, due to the painting’s discoloured varnish and uneven finish: some figures appear rather coarsely painted whilst the objects in the foreground are rendered meticulously. Recent conservation treatment and technical analysis, revealing changes made to the composition during the painting process, undermine the argument that this work is a copy and point instead to it being Poussin’s original.</p></div>
