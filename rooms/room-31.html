        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene takes place in a leafy glade. A young family enjoys a tender moment in the sunshine. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, goddess of love, holds her son <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>’s bow as his father <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a>, god of communication and wit, teaches him to read. Mercury looks down fondly at his child but Venus, leaning on a broken tree trunk, gazes dreamily towards us and smiles. Her gaze is both alluring and elusive, not quite meeting our eye.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unusually, Venus is shown with wings like her son. Her pose resembles the stance of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus Pudica</span> from classical statues, in which the goddess demurely conceals her private parts. Her weight is shifted onto one leg, accentuating the curve of her hip; her spot-lit breasts are pushed up by the sweep of her right arm that directs our attention down to Cupid.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The relationship of the figures to one another appears completely effortless and natural but is actually very sophisticated. The composition is based on a series of criss-crossing diagonals that run through the figures’ limbs and the tree trunks behind them. Venus’ and Mercury’s hands and lower legs echo each other in pose and position, and the line of their arms creates a graceful heart shape that ties the group together. Cupid, with the wings of a little bird (the colours of which are those of the painting – blue, white and gold), stands on the central vertical axis of the composition between his parents at the foot of the tree, the splintered wood at the top of the painting recalling his golden curls. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Correggio</a> has created a wonderful rhythm of soft, sunlit skin against the darkness from which the figures emerge, the careful balance of the composition with his soft, smoky brushwork evoking a deep sense of harmony.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was designed as one of a pair with <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Cupid with a Satyr</span> (Louvre, Paris), which shows Venus and Cupid lying fast asleep on the ground in a leafy glade. A grinning satyr draws back the blue cloth that has been covering them, revealing their naked bodies stretched out in the voluptuous abandon of their dreams. Correggio’s scene of the sleeping mother and child is characteristically tender and naturalistic, their fingers just touching as Cupid snuggles up to his bow on the warm fur of a lion skin. Venus‘ arm is thrown back behind her head, her pose completely open and unguarded. The scene is at once innocent and erotic, and we become voyeurs like the satyr. The Louvre’s picture represents earthly Venus and the National Gallery’s picture represents celestial Venus, and they were meant to hang together.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Originally, the paintings were almost certainly in the collection of Count Nicola Maffei (about 1487–1536) who was a close associate of Federigo <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TZV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gonzaga</a>, Duke of Mantua. A  Maffei family inventory of 1589 records that in a ground floor bedroom of their palace in Mantua was ‘a Venus and Cupid who are asleep with a Satyr from the hand of Correggio’ and ‘a Venus who guides Cupid to school with Mercury from the hand of Correggio.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of Venus with Mercury teaching Cupid to read is rare in art. The episode is described in an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a>  romance by Francesco Colonna called the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hypnerotomachia Poliphili</span> meaning ’Philo’s Strife of Love in a Dream‘. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TP8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Isabella d’Este, Marchioness of Mantua</a>, owned a bronze sculptural group by L‘Antico of Mercury teaching Cupid to read. Correggio or his patron may have had this group in mind when deciding on the subject for this painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When first made, the two paintings were the same size, but ’<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span>' is now significantly smaller than <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus with Cupid and a Satyr</span>, having been cut down. Although the paintings were both designed to be viewed from low down, the figures in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span> are smaller than those in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Cupid with a Satyr</span>, so they must have always made a slightly odd pair.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two surviving preparatory drawings for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span>, a small sketch for the figure of Cupid (British Museum, London) and a first idea for the figure of Venus (Teylers Foundation, Haarlem), suggesting that Correggio carefully planned the picture. However, X-ray images reveal that he made major alterations while painting. He changed the position of Venus’ head so that instead of looking down at Cupid she now looks dreamily at us. This way of working directly on the canvas was particularly typical of Venetian painters.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Correggio, whose real name was Antonio Allegri, was from Correggio, a small town equidistant from Mantua and Parma. His style reflects the fact that he was in the centre of the larger artistic triangle of Venice, Milan and Rome. The blurred contours, soft transitions from rosy shadows to gold and white highlights and from flesh to feather, and the elusive mood of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span> recall the work of the Venetian painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>. The influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>’s Milanese works can be detected in the dreamy smiles and in Venus’ complex pose. Correggio also learned the softness of his modelling from Leonardo’s pictures but developed his own confidence and freedom in the handling of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>, shown in his creation of a sense of living flesh emerging from the darkness of the landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It seems that <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span> was always a very famous painting. The Venetian art dealer Jacopo Strada (portrayed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>), made arrangements to have it and its pair copied in Mantua in 1567. The pose of Cupid, in reverse, seems to have been copied by Titian for the Cupid in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus with a Mirror</span> (National Gallery of Art, Washington). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span> also certainly inspired <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Annibale Carracci</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Toilet of Venus</span> of the 1580s or 1590s (National Gallery, Washington), in which the pose of Venus is reused for one of the nymphs. Even <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>, from Antwerp, quotes from the figure of Cupid in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus and Adonis</span> of about 1612 (State Hermitage Museum, St Petersburg) – he probably saw <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The School of Love</span> in Mantua during his travels in Italy.</p></div>

Psyche represents earthly beauty, while Cupid is Desire aroused by her beauty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Areas of the painting with a higher degree of finish, such as the swirling drapery and the mass of the tree, contrast with thinly painted areas; for example, Cupid’s curls and feathers, which are defined with light touches. The free brushwork and poetic rendering of a mythological story show the importance of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> for Van Dyck, an artist avidly collected by Charles I.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The intimacy and tension of the figures result from a number of simple but striking contrasts: the warmth of Cupid’s flesh tones and drapery against the coolness of Psyche’s skin and cloak; the speed and energy as he barely touches the ground next to the weight of her ’sleeping corpse'. Cupid enters like an Annunciate Angel with hope, while she assumes the form of a Dead Christ in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Lamentation</a>. The diagonals of their bodies are echoed by the dead and living tree beyond which reinforce the idea of Cupid’s touch bringing life back to the dead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/405571/cupid-and-psyche">Text adapted from the Royal Collection website</a></p></div>

A Latin inscription on the tablet hanging from a tree identifies him as ‘King of Great Britain’ – this is Charles I, surveying his kingdom. Anthony van Dyck painted several portraits of Charles, but at over 3.5 metres high and nearly 3 metres wide, this is the largest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Other details communicate the King’s status: the gold chain around his neck shows that he’s a member of an elite society called the Order of the Garter, while the baton of command he holds signals his senior military rank. In the other hand he grasps the reins to his powerful horse – a symbol of the control he has over his state, something he was to lose only a few years later during the British Civil Wars. In January 1649, he was put on trial for treason, and executed.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mounted on a large horse, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSY-0001-0000-0000.htm">King Charles I</a> surveys the landscape of England, one of his kingdoms. He is dressed in fine armour, and his hair flows loosely over his shoulders, although this, and the expensive pearl earring he wears, will be hidden when he puts on the helmet that his servant is passing to him. He is glamorous, but also ready for battle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Though Charles does not wear a crown – a clear symbol of royalty – other objects point to his status: the baton of command he holds signals his senior military rank, and the gold chain around his neck, commonly called the ‘Little George’, shows that he’s a member of an elite society called the Order of the Garter. The horse is equally finely dressed, with gold decoration and elegantly styled hair which, like the King’s, blows lightly in the breeze. Impressively muscular, it is suitable for carrying such an important passenger, who is raised to the very centre of the picture. In one hand, Charles I calmly holds the reins to the powerful animal, demonstrating his greater strength: the power to command his state. He was to lose this control to civil war a few years after this painting was made, and was eventually put on trial for tyranny and treason, and publicly executed by beheading.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As the King’s official painter, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> painted several portraits of Charles I, and while this is the largest, it was not the first to show him with a horse. In one portrait, the King sits proudly on a horse under a stately arch, attended to by his riding master; in another, he and a servant stand by his animal in a landscape, having paused during a hunt. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Equestrian portraits</a> like these have in fact been a popular way of displaying an individual’s power and grandeur for centuries, and one of the most famous early examples is a bronze statue of the Emperor Marcus Aurelius on horseback (Capitoline Museums, Rome).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A portrait of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TWK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles V</a> on a horse by Titian – a favourite artist of both Van Dyck and Charles I – probably inspired the format of this picture. Other equestrian portraits then in the Royal Collection may also have been influential, as well as ancient texts which describe similar scenes. Van Dyck has, however, also painted the horse’s legs in an elegant position, which would have been recognised at the time as a movement from the fashionable sport of horse dancing (called dressage).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A Latin inscription on the tablet hanging from the tree reads: CAROLVS./ REX MAGNAE/ BRITANIAE (‘Charles I, King of Great Britain’). Charles I’s father, James I, had been the first ruler to declare himself ‘King of Great Britain’, even though England and Scotland were not legally joined into the Kingdom of Great Britain under the same monarch until the Acts of Union of 1706–7.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 8 August 1632, Charles I authorised payment to Van Dyck for £20 for ‘One of our royall Consort’. This was perhaps the first single portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria painted by Van Dyck after his arrival in London, and it provided a type from which many variations by the artist and his assistants followed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The charm of the portrait is matched by the lightness of tone and touch with which it is painted: the silvery-grey dress, against dark green, setting off pale pinkish scarlet bows and the pink roses under her right hand. The flesh is modelled with extreme delicacy and her fashionable dress is also recorded with great care. The curtain originally projected more to the left and seems to have been altered by Van Dyck to its present form, and there are signs of alterations down the shadowed area of the Queen’s left sleeve. This painting was probably the source of the Queen’s portrait in the series of royal portraits in the Mortlake tapestry at Houghton Hall, Norfolk.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 8 August 1632, Charles I authorised payment to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a> for £20 for ‘One of our royall Consort’. This was perhaps the first single portrait of Queen Henrietta Maria painted by Van Dyck after his arrival in London, and it provided a type from which many variations by the artist and his assistants followed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The charm of the portrait is matched by the lightness of tone and touch with which it is painted: the silvery-grey dress, against dark green, setting off pale pinkish scarlet bows and the pink roses under her right hand. The flesh is modelled with extreme delicacy and her fashionable dress is also recorded with great care. The curtain originally projected more to the left and seems to have been altered by Van Dyck to its present form, and there are signs of alterations down the shadowed area of the Queen’s left sleeve. This painting was probably the source of the Queen’s portrait in the series of royal portraits in the Mortlake tapestry at Houghton Hall, Norfolk.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his early English portraits Van Dyck includes fashionable details of dress (such as the spiky lace cuffs seen here) that he later tended to omit or simplify. The queen’s bodice and skirt have been pinked with with wavy lines to produce a decorative effect in the lustrous silvery-blue silk, while the ‘carnation’ pink ribbons add warmth to the cool palette. As part of her dowry Henrietta Maria brought a pair of large teardrop-shaped pearls, probably the earrings seen here. Later known as the Mancini pearls, they still survive today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/404430/queen-henrietta-maria-1609-69">Text adapted from the Royal Collection website</a></p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Joseph and Potiphar’s wife is recounted in the book of Genesis (39:7-20). Joseph had been enslaved and purchased by Potiphar, the captain of the Pharaoh’s guard, who appointed him as steward to his household. Potiphar’s wife took a fancy to Joseph (who, we are told, was well-built and handsome) and attempted to seduce him on several occasions. One day, when they were alone, she commanded him to come to bed with her. At this moment painted by Orazio Gentileschi, Joseph escapes her advances but leaves his sumptuous yellow cloak in her hands as she leans, half-naked across an elaborate bed. Joseph’s cloak was later used as evidence in her false accusation of sexual assault, revenge for his rejection of her, and he was flung into prison.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Florentine painter Orazio Gentileschi spent the last thirteen years of his life in London as court painter to King Charles I. Though usually assumed to have been commissioned by the king, it is nonetheless thought that this painting was probably painted for Queen Henrietta Maria, to hang in the Queen’s House at Greenwich. The building accounts for Greenwich for the year 1633-4 include a record for varnishing and gilding four frames for paintings identified as the present painting, Gentileschi’s Finding of Moses (National Gallery), Artemisia Gentileschi’s lost Tarquin and Lucretia and a painting of the Muses. The painting may have hung in the Queen’s antechamber at Greenwich until the Commonwealth sale. After the Restoration in 1660 it was claimed by Henrietta Maria, together with the Finding of Moses, and take by her to Colombes, France.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene is dominated by the weighty red curtain with gold fringed edges, its stiffness and folds painted with great virtuosity to form a theatrical backdrop that frames Potiphar’s wife’s exquisitely porcelain profile. There is an oppressive abundance of heavy, rich fabrics that might muffle the sounds of a would-be seduction. The bed’s magnificent golden camel foot alludes to animal instinct, while the rumpled linen sheets and cascading hair of Potiphar’s wife suggest a struggle. Joseph himself is dressed in contemporary style; his attire recalls other Florentine narrative paintings of this moment. Gentileschi had already been in England for some years, but he clearly remained attuned to the painterly trends in Florence, his hometown. The care taken to render textiles, hangings and clothing with such virtuosity is particularly appropriate for a story focused on the evidence of a cloak.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/search#/12/collection/405477/joseph-and-potiphars-wife">Text adapted from the Royal Collection website</a></p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this vast canvas Orazio Gentileschi depicts the Old Testament story of the Finding of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EEJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Moses</a> (Exodus 2:2-10). When Pharaoh decreed that all newborn sons of Hebrews should be killed, the infant Moses was placed by his mother in a basket and hidden in bulrushes to ensure his safety. Moses’s sister Miriam hid nearby and watched as Pharaoh’s daughter came to bathe in the River Nile, accompanied by her ladies-in-waiting. Upon finding the basket, and the infant inside, Pharaoh’s daughter proposed to take him back to the palace. Miriam came forward and, having offered to find someone to help nurse the baby, fetched her own – and Moses’s – mother. Pharaoh’s daughter named the infant Moses, which means ‘to draw out’, since she had drawn him out of the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This monumental painting is composed of nine life-size female figures who crowd around the basket at the heart of the composition. Just plucked from the water, it is in this basket that we see Moses, plump and wriggling, on a crumpled white sheet. Several of the women lean forward to gaze at this surprising discovery: two at the right gesture towards the river, indicating where the basket was found. The woman in the magnificent yellow gown embellished with jewels is Pharaoh’s daughter. The diminutive figure kneeling respectfully at lower left is Miriam, and beside her – dressed in red and white, and drawing a protective arm around her – is her mother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Having enjoyed an international career, working in cities such as Rome, Genoa, Turin and Paris, Orazio arrived in London in 1626 to assume a position at the court of the newly crowned King Charles I. It was here, in the early 1630s, that he was commissioned to paint <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Finding of Moses</span> for Charles’s wife, Queen Henrietta Maria. The painting was almost certainly intended to celebrate the birth of their son and heir, the future Charles II. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Finding of Moses</span> certainly had special significance for Henrietta Maria since she reclaimed the painting as her personal property after the Restoration and kept it in her private apartments. A closely related variant – today in the Museo del Prado, Madrid – was sent by Orazio as a gift to Philip IV of Spain in 1633, probably to commemorate the birth of Philip’s own heir in 1629.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Together with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Anthony van Dyck</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Peter Paul Rubens</a>, Orazio was one of the leading international painters who came to work at the court of Charles I in England. The paintings he produced in London are characterised by their rich colouring, skilful rendering of luxurious fabrics and courtly elegance. Of all his royal commissions, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Finding of Moses</span> is the most ambitious and displays unparalleled refinement and beauty. Indeed, the women’s gowns are so exquisitely depicted here that they almost eclipse the painting’s narrative content. The idyllic landscape on the right, with its gentle slopes and lush green trees, is more evocative of the English countryside than Egypt where the story of Moses is set. This was a deliberate decision on Orazio’s part, for the painting originally hung in the Queen’s House at Greenwich, on the banks of the River Thames, where he also decorated the ceiling in the Great Hall (possibly with his daughter, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SSJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Artemisia</a>, who briefly joined him in London in the late 1630s).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was made for King Charles I of England and given to him by Rubens, who was acting as an envoy of Philip IV of Spain, in 1630.

These represent future generations, but are also portraits of the children of Sir Balthasar Gerbier, Rubens’s host. Just behind Pax, Minerva, goddess of wisdom, is protecting the group from Mars, god of war. The overall message is clear: rejecting war and embracing peace will bring prosperity and plenty. Rubens’s mission bore fruit: a peace treaty between England and Spain was signed in November 1630.</p></div>

The most famous artist in the world at the time, Rubens was also a skilled negotiator and he had come to London as more than just a painter – he was an envoy of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TNS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Philip IV of Spain</a>. The two countries had been at war for five years and both sides were keen for a peace deal. Charles was an enthusiastic art collector, and with this painting Rubens was both appealing to his connoisseurship and delivering a diplomatic message.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The message is in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> form: the figures in the painting personify different emotions, virtues or other abstract concepts, and there is a clear moral narrative. To understand Rubens’s agenda we have to identify the figures – a combination of mythological beings, Roman gods and real people – and what they stand for.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The woman in the centre represents Pax (Peace), but Rubens seems to have also given her the qualities of Ceres, goddess of the earth. She feeds the child Plutus, god of wealth, with milk from her breast. With the help of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOU-0008-0000-0000.htm">satyr</a> and a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EY8-0008-0000-0000.htm">putto</a>, she shares her bounty, a cornucopia of the fruits of the earth, with the group of children in the foreground. They suggest both the innocence of youth and the hopes of future generations. The boy holding the torch is probably intended as the god of marriage, Hymen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Just above the head of Pax, another putto carries a caduceus (a short staff with two entwined snakes), an attribute of the messenger god <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFX-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mercury</a>, whose associations included the ideals of fair exchange and reciprocation in negotiation. The putto holds an olive wreath, another reference to peace. The role of the two women on the left is less certain. They may be followers of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Bacchus</a>, the god of wine and festivity, which would explain the leopard in the foreground: Bacchus’ chariot was pulled by leopards. He was also the god of agriculture (an appropriate companion for Ceres) and was traditionally accompanied by satyrs and maenads (dancing nymphs). But while this would explain the woman with the tambourine, the other figure with her back to us, carrying a horde of gold and jewels, may simply represent prosperity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The helmeted woman behind Pax is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Minerva</a>, goddess of wisdom. She is protecting the group by pushing away the god of war, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mars</a>. The woman to his right, also being forced back, is probably a Fury, a goddess of vengeance, and to her right, in the top corner, is a harpy, another rapacious monster of classical mythology.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While there is some uncertainty about a few details, the overall message is clear and chimes with Rubens’s mission: rejecting war and embracing peace will bring prosperity and plenty. The mission ultimately bore fruit. Rubens returned to Antwerp in March 1630, having been knighted by Charles, and a peace treaty between England and Spain was signed in November.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another dimension to this picture. As well as being part of the allegory, the children have been identified as the eldest sons and daughters of Sir Balthasar Gerbier, an art dealer in the service of Charles I. Rubens stayed with him during this visit to London. George is the model for Hymen, the girl he is crowning with a floral wreath is his sister Elizabeth. The other girl staring directly at us with big, hopeful and slightly anxious eyes, is another sister, Susan.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">King Ahasuerus’s second wife, Esther, learns that the King’s chief minister is plotting to have all the Jews in the Persian Empire massacred. Esther intercedes with the King and eventually he grants her request to spare her people. The intense colours create an impression of exotic splendour, while strong light heightens the drama. This painting has recently been dated to c.1546-7, just as Tintoretto’s career was about to take off with his first major commission, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Miracle of the Slave</span> (Accademia, Venice) of 1547-8.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story is told in the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible, to which additions were made when it was translated into Greek. King Ahasuerus, or Xerxes I, ruled the Persian Empire when the Jews were captive (485-464 BC). Esther, his second wife, conceals her Jewish identity from him and learns that Haman, the King’s chief minister, is plotting to have all Jews in the Empire massacred. Encouraged by her cousin Mordecai, Esther decides to intercede with the King on behalf of her people. She fasts, puts on royal robes and approaches the King, an act full of danger as it was forbidden, on pain of death, for anyone to enter the inner court without a royal summons. In the Greek addition Esther faints when she sees his face full of anger; then ‘God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself’. Eventually Ahasuerus grants her request to spare the Jews and Haman is hung on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ahasuerus is described as ‘clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones’; in the painting his golden robe originally had more orpiment - a bright yellow pigment. Esther enters with two maids, ‘leaning daintily on one, while the other followed carrying her train’; she is ‘radiant with perfect beauty, but her heart was frozen in fear’. Tintoretto was one of the first artists to show her fainting, a motif that linked her to that of the Virgin collapsing at the foot of the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another version of the painting, on the same scale, in the Escorial, which is generally accepted as a workshop replica: in that painting two extra figures appear to the right and a kneeling boy in armour holds a banner behind the king. The same figure appears holding back a curtain in an engraving by Simon Gribelin after the Royal Collection painting made in 1712. In the present painting the boy is gone and two unfinished figures occupy the same position: a twisting man, with a long scarf around his neck, and a shadowy, turbaned figure. It seems that these two figures were part of Tintoretto’s first idea for the composition: the twisting figure could be Haman reacting to the events behind the King, his long scarf knotted about his neck alluding to his future hanging, and the turbaned figure is his companion. The artist must then have changed his mind, left these figures half-finished, and painted a boy in armour over them. Possibly at this point Haman was painted in similar costume, and his turbaned companion, with soldiers and banners, in the centre background. At some date after 1712, probably in the nineteenth century, an unknown restorer decided to remove the boy in armour (along with the curtain and a portion of the left background), presumably in order to ‘retrieve’ the two figures. Unfortunately, the unfinished turbaned figure was damaged in the process, so presumably the same restorer replaced the boy in armour (with the curtain, surrounding background and the yellow highlights of Ahasuerus’s folds of drapery). At this stage the boy was at once ‘original’ (that is, reflecting Tintoretto’s final intention for the painting) and entirely repainted. He can be seen, clearly of inferior quality compared with the original areas, in reproductions made before 1950. When the painting was cleaned in 1950 the boy was removed and the ‘twisting’ and the ‘turbaned’ figures below were reconstructed. This solution was also adopted during the 1991 conservation. The consequence is that Haman appears twice in the same painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dialogo di Pittura</span> published in 1548, a few years after this painting was completed, Paolo Pino claimed that Tintoretto had set out to combine the drawing of Michelangelo and the colour of Titian; Ridolfi later claimed that Tintoretto had this motto written on his studio wall. A series of drawings of this period show Tintoretto studying Michelangelo’s sculpture and that of his Venetian contemporaries (by this time heavily influenced by Michelangelo).

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">King Ahasuerus’s second wife, Esther, learns that the King’s chief minister is plotting to have all the Jews in the Persian Empire massacred. Esther intercedes with the King and eventually he grants her request to spare her people. The intense colours create an impression of exotic splendour, while strong light heightens the drama. This painting has recently been dated to c.1546-7, just as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PTW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tintoretto’s</a> career was about to take off with his first major commission, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Miracle of the Slave</span> (Accademia, Venice) of 1547-8.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story is told in the Book of Esther in the Hebrew Bible, to which additions were made when it was translated into Greek. King Ahasuerus, or Xerxes I, ruled the Persian Empire when the Jews were captive (485-464 BC). Esther, his second wife, conceals her Jewish identity from him and learns that Haman, the King’s chief minister, is plotting to have all Jews in the Empire massacred. Encouraged by her cousin Mordecai, Esther decides to intercede with the King on behalf of her people. She fasts, puts on royal robes and approaches the King, an act full of danger as it was forbidden, on pain of death, for anyone to enter the inner court without a royal summons. In the Greek addition Esther faints when she sees his face full of anger; then ‘God changed the spirit of the king to gentleness, and in alarm he sprang from his throne and took her in his arms until she came to herself’. Eventually Ahasuerus grants her request to spare the Jews and Haman is hung on the gallows he had prepared for Mordecai.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ahasuerus is described as ‘clothed in the full array of his majesty, all covered with gold and precious stones’; in the painting his golden robe originally had more orpiment - a bright yellow pigment. Esther enters with two maids, ‘leaning daintily on one, while the other followed carrying her train’; she is ‘radiant with perfect beauty, but her heart was frozen in fear’. Tintoretto was one of the first artists to show her fainting, a motif that linked her to that of the Virgin collapsing at the foot of the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another version of the painting, on the same scale, in the Escorial, which is generally accepted as a workshop replica: in that painting two extra figures appear to the right and a kneeling boy in armour holds a banner behind the king. The same figure appears holding back a curtain in an engraving by Simon Gribelin after the Royal Collection painting made in 1712. In the present painting the boy is gone and two unfinished figures occupy the same position: a twisting man, with a long scarf around his neck, and a shadowy, turbaned figure. It seems that these two figures were part of Tintoretto’s first idea for the composition: the twisting figure could be Haman reacting to the events behind the King, his long scarf knotted about his neck alluding to his future hanging, and the turbaned figure is his companion. The artist must then have changed his mind, left these figures half-finished, and painted a boy in armour over them. Possibly at this point Haman was painted in similar costume, and his turbaned companion, with soldiers and banners, in the centre background. At some date after 1712, probably in the nineteenth century, an unknown restorer decided to remove the boy in armour (along with the curtain and a portion of the left background), presumably in order to ‘retrieve’ the two figures. Unfortunately, the unfinished turbaned figure was damaged in the process, so presumably the same restorer replaced the boy in armour (with the curtain, surrounding background and the yellow highlights of Ahasuerus’s folds of drapery). At this stage the boy was at once ‘original’ (that is, reflecting Tintoretto’s final intention for the painting) and entirely repainted. He can be seen, clearly of inferior quality compared with the original areas, in reproductions made before 1950. When the painting was cleaned in 1950 the boy was removed and the ‘twisting’ and the ‘turbaned’ figures below were reconstructed. This solution was also adopted during the 1991 conservation. The consequence is that Haman appears twice in the same painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dialogo di Pittura</span> published in 1548, a few years after this painting was completed, Paolo Pino claimed that Tintoretto had set out to combine the drawing of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a> and the colour of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>; Ridolfi later claimed that Tintoretto had this motto written on his studio wall. A series of drawings of this period show Tintoretto studying Michelangelo’s sculpture and that of his Venetian contemporaries (by this time heavily influenced by Michelangelo). Tintoretto does not exactly quote from Michelangelo here, as he does in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">St Mark Rescuing the Slave</span> (1547-8; Accademia, Venice), but his confidently modelled, twisting and foreshortened figures clearly recall his work.
