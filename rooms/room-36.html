        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a> was a prolific painter of seascapes, and this is one of three imaginary seaports owned by the National Gallery. The subject of this painting is identifiable only by the artist’s inscription, barely visible on the stone step to the right. According to the Old Testament, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Queen of Sheba</a> went to visit King Solomon in Jerusalem (1 Kings 10: 1–2). Crowned and dressed in red, the Queen is descending the steps on the right. The meeting was often painted, but it was unusual to depict the Queen’s embarkation. In the Bible, she travels across the desert by camel, but Claude sends her by sea.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene is bathed in the soft warm light of sunrise, capturing the gentle ripples of the water, undersides of the clouds and foliage, and silhouettes of the boats. There is hurried activity involving groups of figures: in the foreground two men carry a chest, while other figures prepare to row the Queen and her companions towards the larger ships used for the voyage. The classical buildings inspired by Claude’s time in Rome create a symmetrical and balanced scene. Columns support a balcony decorated with sculptures, from which figures watch the scene below. The bystanders on the bridge behind are conveyed through single dots of paint. The variety of the shells scattered along the bottom of the painting reflects Claude’s attention to the most intricate details.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was inspired by several earlier Claudes: the composition is shown in reverse in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D75-0001-0000-0000.htm">Embarkation of Saint Ursula</a></span>, also owned by the National Gallery, and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Seaport with Ulysses restoring Chrysalis to her Father</span> (Louvre, Paris). <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba</span> and its pair, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebecca</a></span>, were painted in 1648 for the Duc de Bouillon (1605–1652), a French general in the Papal army. The patron’s name is  inscribed on the last stone step in the bottom right corner, suggesting his interest in this story. He may have meant a connection to be made between King Solomon in Jerusalem and his ancestor, Godefroy de Bouillon (1060–1100), briefly the ruler of Jerusalem at the end of the eleventh century. Although commonly found in Claude’s paintings, the round tower  included in both paintings was the principal emblem of the Duc de Bouillon, whose family name was De la Tour d’Auvergne (the Tower of Auvergne). A shield with a coat of arms is attached to the top of the tower, although it is hard to see the details. The Bouillon coat of arms was inscribed with words from the Song of Solomon, which further connects the duke with Solomon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">These paintings were among the first to be bought for the National Gallery in 1824, from the prestigious collection of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T0D-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Julius Angerstein</a> (1735–1823). Claude’s work was highly regarded by later artists: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">J. M. W.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of this painting is only identified through an inscription on the tree-stump by the group of reclining figures in the centre. It is the marriage of Isaac and Rebecca from the book of Genesis (24: 1–67). The couple are dancing with tambourines, surrounded by others enjoying the festivities. The flat landscape and expanse of water stretching far into the distance are imaginary, but inspired by the landscape around Rome. Claude spent most of his working life in the city, and made frequent trips to sketch the surrounding countryside. The mill and a town in the background and naturalistic sky are common features of Claude’s paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture, with its pair <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Seaport with the Embarkation of the Queen of Sheba</a></span>, was painted in 1648 for Frédéric-Maurice, duc de Bouillon. Unlike its pair, this painting does not include the patron’s name, although the subject of a wedding may have interested the duke as he was happily married to Eléanor-Catherine de Bergh. A round tower appears in both paintings. Although commonly found in Claude’s works, this was an emblem of the duc de Bouillon – his family name was De la Tour d’Auvergne (the Tower of Auvergne). The paintings escaped seizure during the French Revolution despite Bouillon’s successor, Jacques-Léopold Charles, being imprisoned in 1794 and his property confiscated.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the early nineteenth century, the English banker <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T0D-0001-0000-0000.htm">John Julius Angerstein</a> purchased both paintings for the very high sum of £8,400. They were among the first works to be bought by the National Gallery in 1824 from Angerstein, whose house was near to where the Gallery now stands. Claude’s renown among later artists is shown by the fact that when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">J.M.W. Turner</a> bequeathed to the Gallery his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXL-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sun rising through Vapour</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dido building Carthage</a></span>, he made it a condition that they were hung next to Claude’s two paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another version of this composition also by Claude in the Galleria Doria-Pamphilj, Rome, is known as ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Mill</span>’. The subject of the painting and identity of the patron would have been unclear to a seventeenth-century audience as this version has no inscription.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is low tide in the early morning and fishermen unload their catch from a boat beached high and dry on the shore. Some people enjoy a meal. Others prepare the catch for sale. This human activity contrasts with the stillness of the glassy sea which, like a mirror, reflects the hazy sunlight. The silvery-white sheen of the water complements the gold-tinted clouds. The pale yellow sun is not yet hot enough to burn off the sea mist – the ‘vapour’ referred to in the picture’s title – which gives the large warships in the background an almost ghostly aura. On the horizon (centre right), you can just see a faint plume of smoke as a ship fires a morning gun.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A drawing inscribed ‘Study / Calm’ in his ‘Calais Pier’ sketchbook of about 1802–5 shows that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Turner</a> settled on the painting’s theme and composition early on. A ‘calm’ (a smooth sea) was a favourite subject in Dutch marine painting – for example, van de Velde’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E65-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dutch Ships in a Calm</a></span>, also in the National Gallery’s collection. As a study of a calm, Turner’s painting was a departure from the wild storms of his earlier marine pictures such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Calais Pier</a></span>. Instead of combining dramatic action with a dynamic handling of paint, Turner used rich colours laid down as finely painted surfaces to create a tranquil, even slightly elegiac, mood. This ability to paint the sea in contrasting states further consolidated his reputation as primarily a ‘great sea-painter’. The emphatic focus on the sun as the source of light is a feature of several of Turner’s compositions, but here he also adds incidental details such as the objects on the beach, including an anchor, driftwood and stranded marine life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The work of Dutch painters, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OYR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Aelbert Cuyp</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PVF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Willem van de Velde</a>, is also evoked by the boats and figures – an influence acknowledged by the picture’s later title, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Dutch Boats</span>, when it was exhibited in Turner’s own gallery in 1810. Some of the figures, especially, resemble those painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PM9-0001-0000-0000.htm">David Teniers the Younger</a>, particularly the hunched figure wearing a red Flemish cap seen from behind. Such details imply that Turner intended to suggest a Dutch setting, but not necessarily a specific location. As one contemporary noted, Holland’s North Sea coast faced west, so it would not have been possible to see a sunrise over the open sea from the mainland.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Turner himself had great affection for the painting. It was bought by Sir John Leicester, one of his major patrons, but when Sir John’s estate was sold at auction upon his death in 1827 Turner bought it back for a higher price. In his second will, made in 1831, Turner specified that the picture, together with his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dido building Carthage</a></span>, should hang ‘in perpetuity’ in the newly built National Gallery alongside Claude’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Seaport</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with the Marriage of Isaac and Rebekah</a></span>. Turner revisited the subject when, around 1809, he painted a smaller modified version, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sun rising through Vapour</span>, which is now in the Barber Institute of Fine Arts, Birmingham.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Turner</a>’s most ambitious late mythological paintings in which he brought together a range of sources to create his own interpretation of a legend.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Hero and Leander was originally told by Musaeus, a Greek poet of the fourth or fifth century BC. Hero, a priestess of Aphrodite, lived in a tower in Sestos on the Hellespont strait, which separates Europe from Asia. She was in love with Leander, a young man from Abydos on the Asian side. Every night she would hold up a lamp to guide him as he swam through the water to be with her. One night the lamp blew out, and he was drowned. On seeing his dead body, Hero threw herself off her tower to join him in death. Although Turner cited an English translation of Masaeus as his source, he also included seven lines of his own poetry in the Royal Academy catalogue when the painting was exhibited in 1837.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A sketchbook study from 1802 suggests that Turner had planned a picture of Hero and Leander some 35 years before he produced this picture. The story had been painted by many artists during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, most notably by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a>, but Turner was most likely prompted to create his version when paintings by contemporaries, Henry Howard and William Etty, were exhibited in 1806 and 1827. A further impetus came when Lord Byron’s poem, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Bride of Abydos</span>, was published in 1813. Abydos was Leander’s home, and the poem also included reference to his and Hero’s tragic fate. Turner was a keen admirer of Byron, and had illustrated an edition of his works, so he would have known about the poem. In May 1810 Byron had also famously swum across the Hellespont from Sestos to Abydos, this celebrated feat stimulating a surge of interest in the story of the doomed couple.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The two lovers are not the largest figures in the painting. Turner breaks with the conventions of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFT-0008-0000-0000.htm">history painting</a>, which required the principal characters be in or near the centre of the picture, and places them almost hidden in shadow at the water’s edge as Leander prepares to leave. Above them on the terrace, a winged <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, who has cast his bow and quiver on the ground, holds up a lamp and a torch. Hymen stands beside him. Around them, Turner constructs an imaginary location from various classical architectural elements, a wide staircase and a large floor mosaic. On the right, an exotic ‘Moorish’ tower, representing Abydos on the Turkish coast, is just visible behind the large, jagged rocks upon which ghostly sea nymphs have gathered.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As Turner’s verse states, the night is ending, as ‘love yet lingers'. Although dawn is just breaking, a crescent moon is still visible in the turbulent blue-black sky. Turner uses the darkness and deep shadows to heighten the drama of the scene and to perhaps hint at the tragedy about to occur, as Leander leaves Hero, never to return.</p></div>
