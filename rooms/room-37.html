        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this striking portrait, a young man stands with one hand placed firmly on his hip, magnificently dressed in a red fur-lined cape, a luxurious silver silk waistcoat and red breeches. He looks forward with pursed lips and no hint of a smile. This is Richard Milles of Nackington, who sat for this portrait when he was in Rome during his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Grand Tour</a>. He points to a map which lies next a classical sculpted bust; the map is inscribed with ‘Grisons’, the name of a Swiss Canton that he probably visited on his way to Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Milles was a Member of Parliament for Canterbury from 1761 to 1780. He commissioned <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OY6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Batoni</a> to paint several other works: a three-quarter length portrait (location unknown) and a miniature on ivory (Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge). The artist’s portraits are highly finished, with facial features and fabrics vividly and precisely evoked – here, Batoni has confidently imitated the soft fur of the cape and the ruffled linen of the shirt. The swaggering pose appears frequently in Batoni’s portraits and in the work of earlier artists, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Dyck</a>, as a way of establishing the sitter’s commanding presence and their self-assurance. The mood of this portrait is one of self-assurance and ease, created by the artist to dignify his sitter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Batoni often used antiquities to establish both a sitter’s location and their status as a learned, cultivated gentleman. He became extremely well-known for his portraits in which a casually posed sitter is surrounded by classical statuary. Here, the classical columns at the right form the backdrop not only for the sitter but also for a bust of the Roman Emperor Marcus Aurelius, which only features this once in Batoni’s work. This is a depiction of a real sculpture, now in the Capitoline Museum in Rome. Marcus Aurelius was famed for his success as a military leader and as a philosopher who wrote extensively on stoicism. On the table beside the bust are several books, perhaps travel notebooks or philosophical treatises. In the background, we catch a glimpse of a classical building and mountainous Italian landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rome was one of the essential stops for a gentleman in search of education and cultural exploration in Europe during the eighteenth century. Batoni was established there as the most sought-after portraitist of his day, and painted this portrait in around 1759, when he was at his most prolific. His popularity continued throughout the 1760s and 1770s, during which time another Englishman in Rome commissioned <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E97-0001-0000-0000.htm">a portrait</a>, also in the National Gallery’s collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Sharp and angular, the Saxon fortress of Königstein is silhouetted against a pale sky. It sits atop a rocky outcrop about 25 miles south-east of Dresden, in present-day Germany, overlooking the Elbe valley. The artist, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P0B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellotto</a>, was from Venice, and he has applied the traditions of Venetian view painting – a high level of detail, the large scale – to this northern landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He seems to have relished the challenge of painting this imposing site. He has treated the crumbling stone walls with miniaturist precision, and each window and scaffolding pole is highlighted. Soldiers created with just a few dots of paint stand guard on the ramparts. The clouds on the horizon give way to a shimmering light which warms the rocks and walls, and casts shadows which emphasise their angular geometry.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We move from the careful detail of the craggy rocks and rising walls to a broad panorama, the sweeping landscape softening the military presence of the fortress. Peasants and bystanders are dotted about the scene, creating an idyllic pastoral atmosphere. Sunlight falls on the curving path, gently sloping fields, trees and figures, picking out the men in a grassy glade, and a woman and her young children. A little higher, a slice of intense light illuminates the livestock perched on a craggy ledge and a horseman descending into the valley beyond. Higher still, it touches a small group of adventurers navigating the steep terrain, dwarfed by the cliff face that towers above them. The cattle, and the cowherd leaning against one of his animals in deep shade on the far right, recall pastoral motifs found in earlier art, particularly the seventeenth-century Dutch Italianate genre painting. Such models could be found in etchings after artists like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5U-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Nicolaes Berchem</a>, whose work was in high demand in Italy throughout the eighteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bellotto trained in his uncle <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a>’s studio. As a young artist, he produced <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDX-0008-0000-0000.htm">capricci</a></span> scenes and views of Venice, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D1Y-0001-0000-0000.htm">Venice: Upper Reaches of the Grand Canal facing Santa Croce</a></span>. He was called to Dresden in 1747, and appointed Court Painter to King Augustus III of Poland and Elector of Saxony in 1748, receiving the highest annual salary ever paid by that court to an artist. North of the Alps, he worked independently and started to produce work on a grander and more ambitious scale. The large scale and distinctive subject of this painting shows that change, and it provides a striking contrast to Canaletto’s work. Bellotto leaned towards a lighter tonality and a cooler palette; his figures are more characterised, and - particularly in this work - more skilfully integrated into the landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Commissioned by Augustus III in 1756, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Fortress of Königstein from the North</span> is one of five paintings of Königstein, each from a different viewpoint – two, now in Manchester Art Gallery, show the castle from within the walls, and the other two, in The National Gallery of Art in Washington and in a private collection, are of exterior views. The fortress had served as a refuge during times of conflict, as well as a treasury and store for the royal art collection; it had been immensely important for Saxon kings and electors since its construction in 1589. All of these pictures are characterised by panoramic compositions, strongly contrasted light and shadow, and meticulous attention to detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The five Königstein pictures were almost certainly intended to complement Bellotto’s 17 views of Dresden and 11 of Pirna that decorated the royal palace in Dresden (many of which are now in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden). However, the escalation of the Seven Years’ War and invasion of Dresden by Prussian troops just after the series was commissioned meant that the paintings were never delivered. King Augustus III fled to Warsaw, and the royal picture galleries were emptied and the works moved to the fortress at Königstein for safekeeping. Bellotto received a payment for the pictures in 1758; we are not sure what happened to them after this. That same year he left Dresden for the safety of Vienna, though he returned a few years later. In 1766 he settled in Warsaw, where he spent the rest of his career. All five of the pictures were imported into Britain during the artist’s lifetime, and until 1993 all of them were in British collections.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are a significant number of Italian view paintings in the National Gallery’s collection, mostly of Venice, but Bellotto was one of the few Venetian view painter to work north of the Alps. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Fortress of Königstein from the North</span> is an outstanding example of his work, painted at the peak of his career.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This intriguing picture is Boilly’s painted imitation of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">print</a> after one of his own compositions (possibly now lost). Although Boilly was an expert in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FDA-0008-0000-0000.htm">trompe l’oeil</a>, it is unlikely that he intended here to trick the viewer into thinking they are looking at an actual print, as the painting does not include any of the usual clues that would reveal the image to be a deception – for example, a turned-up corner, a tear or crease in the paper or a supposedly broken sheet of glass over the print. Instead, this is an exercise in illusionism, as Boilly demonstrates how one <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0LTF-000A-0000-0000.htm">medium</a> (oil painting) can look like another (printing).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here we see a girl in a fine white dress and bonnet sitting on a stone window ledge. On the wall behind her hang a bird in a cage, a plant and a bunch of carrots. On the window ledge itself is a bowl containing two goldfish, a small bottle filled with dark liquid, and a telescope. The girl holds a eyeglass in her right hand and, just to the left, there is another telescope, through which a young boy in the shadows is looking. Below the window is an antique stone <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8P-0008-0000-0000.htm">frieze</a>, which is partly covered by the fabric that spills out from inside the window.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is painted almost entirely in tones of black, grey and white, and is intended to imitate the look of a monochrome print. As there are no lines in this ‘print’ (as we might expect, for example, in an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGD-0008-0000-0000.htm">etching</a>), it is likely that Boilly intended to imitate a mezzotint, which can produce subtle effects of light and dark without using lines, and is particularly effective for reproducing paintings. Boilly enhances the illusion by painting a grey-blue mount with his signature around the image.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture shows Boilly’s technical virtuosity with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a> as he depicts objects with the meticulous detail of a miniaturist. Not only does he paint a diverse range of materials and surfaces, including stone, glass, satin and skin, but several objects – for example, the clear glass bowl filled with water and the bright metal telescope – highlight his skill in painting reflective surfaces. The smooth painting technique is indebted to the ‘fine painters’ (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">fijnschilders</span>) of seventeenth-century Holland, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q5G-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gerrit Dou</a> (with whom Boilly was compared) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PMY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Casper Netscher</a>. These painters used the framing device of a figure sitting at a window in their paintings and often included a carved bas-relief below the windowsill.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his picture Boilly, who was fascinated by optics, emphasises the activity of looking by including several optical devices, encouraging the viewer to consider what they are in fact seeing. When exhibited at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1799, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Girl at a Window</span> was praised for being ‘astonishingly true to life’. The phrase ‘true to life’ had a different significance at that time and could mean not only truth to reality but also, as here, truth to another medium – in this instance, an oil painting that looks like a paper print.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view is from the bank of the River Thames, looking across a sprawling meadow towards Eton College on the horizon. Most of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a>’s English views overlook the Thames in the heart of London, in the same way that his most engaging Venetian scenes are never far from the Grand Canal. But here he has captured the river’s peaceful, meandering journey through the countryside.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A shady glade gives way to a softly lit river bank, with folk enjoying the fine summer’s day – away from the hustle and bustle of city life, they fish, boat and picnic. There’s a family group just in front of us, the smartly dressed man carrying a basket. They may have been brought up river by the boatman emerging over the riverbank and carrying an oar nearby. On the far side of the river, you can just make out groups of people out for a stroll.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dominant building is the chapel, finished in 1482, and to its right the red-brick buildings of Eton College, a school founded by King Henry VI in 1440. There are a number of inaccuracies in the depiction of these buildings and many of those that surround them, which suggests the artist had little knowledge of the view. He perhaps relied on a sketch made on the spot at an earlier date, or an inaccurate drawing or engraving by someone else.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A finely painted tree frames the scene and leads the eye towards the middle distance, as do the layers of landscape and river bathed in subtle variations of light and shadow. These were well-established features of landscape painting, present in the work of the seventeenth-century Italianate landscapists – see <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F3N-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with Narcissus and Echo</a></span> or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ORX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gaspard Dughet</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Landscape with Abraham and Issac</a></span> – as well as that of contemporary English view painters, like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Richard Wilson</a> in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Holt Bridge on the River Dee</a></span>.

The light and airy atmosphere and the broad, fluid brushstrokes which make up the figures, foliage and still water, are typical of the artist’s late style – look at his Italian views of the late 1750s, for example <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0COI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Piazza San Marco and the Colonnade of the Procuratie Nuove</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know who commissioned the picture, though the subject would have appealed to any of the school’s affluent former students.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting shows the inside of the famous rotunda at Ranelagh Gardens in Chelsea. Ranelagh opened in 1742 as one of London’s most prestigious pleasure gardens, and its main attraction was this vast circular building in which fashionable society could attend balls and listen to music (the young Mozart even performed there in 1764). Despite the popularity of these grand pavilions and formal gardens during the eighteenth century, they fell out of fashion as the century progressed; the rotunda closed in 1803 and was demolished in 1805.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Made almost entirely of wood, the rotunda had an internal diameter of 150 feet and contained 100 private supper-boxes. Concerts were performed on a grand stage – and here, to the right, an orchestra plays, filling the cavernous space with music. They catch the attention of a small crowd while other visitors sit around tables, enjoying refreshment under the colonnade (admission fee included a cup of tea or coffee). Small groups stroll around the central column, which is exquisitely painted and gilded with Rococo  motifs, and encases a huge fireplace that would entice visitors during wet and chilly weather.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We look down on the elegant clientele, which, along with the light that floods the space, emphasises the building’s loftiness. While sunlight peeks through a doorway on the left, it’s not strong enough to fill the room, and is too low to light the walls and central column in the way we see. Instead, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Canaletto</a>’s theatrical lighting comes from the upper left corner, highlighting the smooth curvature of the roof, archways and windows, and sparkling on the delicate chandeliers. We are not just watching the concert – we watch the men, women and children scattered across the scene, as if on an enormous stage. They too provide a sense of the building’s scale.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An inscription in Italian on the back states that the picture was painted in 1754 during Canaletto’s stay in England, during which he dominated the London market for view paintings – no other artist, native or foreign, could compare to him. This is one of six views commissioned by Thomas Hollis, a close friend of Joseph Smith, Canaletto’s loyal patron, and one of many British travellers who had likely become captivated by the artist’s work during their trips to Venice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view relates closely to a print by Nathaniel Parr, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Inside View of the Rotunda in Ranelagh Gardens</span>, published in 1751 – around the same time as Canaletto’s earlier version of this subject taken from the opposite side of the interior (Compton Verney, Warwickshire). One other painting in our collection dates from Canaletto’s time in England: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Eton College</a></span>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Pierre-Joseph-Victor de Besenval (1721–1791) was a soldier and art collector who from 1764 lived in part of what is now the Swiss embassy in the rue de Grenelle in Paris. He fought in numerous campaigns as an officer in France’s Swiss Guards and, just prior to the French Revolution, had been their commander-in-chief. Made a chevalier de l’Ordre royal et militaire de Saint Louis in 1744, he was awarded the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Louis in 1766. His highly successful military career culminated in his appointment in 1781 as commander-in-chief of all French troops of the interior except Paris. The baron had also belonged to the circle close to Queen Marie Antoinette. His association with such an unpopular figure prompted his flight to his native Switzerland soon after the fall of the Bastille in 1789, but he was arrested while fleeing. Through luck and a good legal defence, he avoided the guillotine and was released from prison in 1790. He died the following year in his home, surrounded by his collection of furniture, objets d’art and paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait was probably painted by Danloux in 1791, the year the baron died. Although his salon (a living or drawing room) is extremely well furnished, the furniture and fittings do not represent current fashions but instead reflect <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Rococo</a> styles that had been fashionable around the mid-eighteenth century. Funded by inheritances and by generous salaries, awards and pensions, the baron had spent lavishly throughout his life. In addition to his collection of paintings, some of which we see here, he collected oriental porcelain. A Japanese Arita carp is shown behind his left shoulder and vases in Rococo gilt-bronze mounts stand on the mantelpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Besenval himself wears a stylish version of a plain cutaway English coat, probably made of a silk/wool cloth with a velvet collar. Danloux paints the different textures of skin, fabric, porcelain, wood and marble with great dexterity, creating subtle colour harmonies from the dark greens of the chair and damask wall covering, the grey coat and the glimpse of red waistcoat set against the gilt mounts and picture frames. The painting’s own French Louis XVI giltwood frame may be original.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A preparatory drawing shows the baron seated with his legs crossed, but with his face and upper body turned towards the viewer instead of the profile view we see here. By changing the pose from full frontal to profile, Danloux focuses the viewer’s attention less on Besenval himself and more on the objects in the room; the baron, in effect, becomes part of his own collection. In the drawing he may be wearing a decoration on his chest, which would have been the Grand Cross of the Order of Saint Louis. However, this does not appear in the painting, as it would have been unwise, in the political climate of 1791, for the baron to display his association with the Swiss Guards and Ancien Régime.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Having lived an eventful life in which he risked death both on the battlefield and due to his connection with the royal court, the baron is shown as a reflective man relaxing in an environment stamped by his style and personality. Danloux presents him as a collector of refinement and taste in a painting that is itself an object of consummate skill.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Goya adds a satirical twist to this supposedly innocent scene, set in an idyllic landscape. It appears that a romantic outing has gone terribly wrong. The remains of a picnic lie on the tablecloth: pieces of bread, two almost-empty plates and bottles of wine. To the right, a man appears to be unwell, presumably from drinking too much, and he cradles his face in his hands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the centre, a man holding a full glass of wine tries to flirt with the woman sat near him.

The works explore a number of themes in countryside settings – hunting, music and dance, playing games and eating – inspired by light-hearted scenes of daily life in Madrid. These subjects reflected the King’s own desire to understand the lives of working-class people. Only one tapestry, that depicting a game of blind man’s bluff, was finally woven (and is now in the Museo del Prado, Madrid). Perhaps the scene we see here was deemed too disturbing for the princesses' bedrooms.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1775 Goya had started working for the Royal Tapestry Factory and he continued to produce designs on and off for the next two decades. During this time, he established his career as court painter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture is typical of Goya’s style in the later 1780s: the paint is applied softly, with a light touch, creating hazy lighting effects and visible, lively brushstrokes. It was among a group of works by Goya sold to the Duke of Osuna, one of the artist’s most loyal supporters and patrons, in about 1799. The painting remained with the Osuna family until the National Gallery bought it in 1896, together with <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FT0-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Scene from El Hechizado por Fuerza</a></span>.</p></div>

In this painting Goya may be protesting against the Spanish Inquisition, which promoted the Catholic faith and persecuted Jews and Muslims, for here he makes fun of folklore and the Church-led return to medieval fears.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was a private commission, one of six scenes of witchcraft and sorcery painted for the Duke and Duchess of Osuna in 1798 and exhibited together at the Royal Academy in Madrid the following year. The Osunas were Goya’s most loyal patrons between 1785 and 1799. Their palace in Madrid and country house on the outskirts of the city served as meeting places for artists, actors and musicians, and Goya probably attended the private theatre the couple owned. The Duchess was a keen reformer of Spanish society, critical of the Church’s corruption and the superstition of people who still believed in witchcraft.</p></div>

One woman breastfeeds an infant, while another holds up a second baby for a kiss. A woman to the left is busy arranging bedding in a wooden cradle. The open loggia and warm light suggest that the scene takes place in a southern climate. To an eighteenth-century audience, the women’s clothing would have been understood as antique Roman dress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shares similarities with a series of eight paintings by Lagrenée at Stourhead in Wiltshire. It may be Lagrenée’s painting formerly at Stourhead, described as ‘Maternal Affection – a beautiful group’. The subject was of special interest for a contemporary audience as motherhood, and particularly the practice of breastfeeding one’s own children rather than sending them out to a wet nurse, was much discussed in both France and England at the time.</p></div>

Leafy trees and blue skies dominate the top third of the picture space. Purple drapery is hung from the wall, providing a backdrop to the tender scene in the foreground. In the centre, a woman breastfeeds an infant, while an attendant or companion next to her holds up a second baby for a kiss. A woman to the left is busy arranging bedding in a wooden cradle. The open loggia and warm light suggest that the scene takes place in a southern climate. To an eighteenth-century audience, the women’s clothing would have been understood as antique Roman dress. The semi-transparent pieces of cloth over the women’s breasts may have been added later, presumably for the sake of modesty, as the paint is different from that used for the rest of their clothing.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shares similarities with a series of eight paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SZR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lagrenée</a> at Stourhead in Wiltshire. One of these, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Indulgent Mother</span>, which is also painted on copper and of almost the same dimensions, shows three women who look very similar to those here. Similar tiles, columns and drapery are depicted in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Spartan Mother</span> also at Stourhead, although that picture is painted on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> and much larger. The painting at Stourhead most like our one is <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Contented Old Age</span>, another small-scale painting on copper, in which an elderly man, a nursing mother and two infants crowd around a crib strikingly similar to the one in our picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has been suggested that the National Gallery’s painting may be either <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Candeur</span> (Candour) or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Douceur</span> (Sweetness), which Lagrenée exhibited at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1775. The pictures belonged to William Petty, Earl of Shelburne until he was made 1st Marquess of Lansdowne in 1784. The owner of Bowood, he commissioned several paintings from leading artists in Paris in 1774–5. However, our painting does not match the description of either <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Candeur</span> or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">La Douceur</span> at the sale of Lansdowne’s possessions after this death. Another painting by Lagrenée appears in Lansdowne’s second posthumous sale, which is described as ‘Maternal Affection – a beautiful group’ and does seem to match the subject matter of our painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We do not know whether the subject was chosen by Lagrenée himself or by his patron (possibly Lansdowne). However, it was of special interest for a contemporary audience as motherhood, and particularly the practice of breastfeeding one’s own children rather than sending them out to a wet nurse, was much discussed on both sides of the Channel during the second half of the eighteenth century. Many artists responded to these new ideas of maternity and childhood, and depictions of motherhood in both <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEX-0008-0000-0000.htm">genre scenes</a> and portraiture became more frequent. It is typical of Lagrenée that he chose to treat the subject of motherhood in neoclassical guise. This is idealised motherhood, as flawless as the women’s rosy cheeks and skin like marble. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Maternal Affection</span> is an intimate picture of an intimate scene, exquisitely painted with meticulous detail and beautiful colouring, which translates physical closeness into emotional warmth.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Lottery in Piazza di Montecitorio</span> shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QGJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Panini</a>’s gift as both a master of architectural perspective and a painter of picturesque scenes of everyday life. In this monumental painting, a large crowd awaits the results of a lottery draw, which is taking place on the balcony of the Palazzo di Montecitorio, Rome. The lottery was held nine times a year from 1743, around the time this work was painted, until 1870. The proceeds were used for charitable and religious purposes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has depicted this popular event in a highly theatrical way. A man standing on the balcony of the palazzo’s facade has released the winning ticket into the air – you can just make out a small piece of paper to the right of the building’s entrance fluttering towards an excited group beneath. But the foreground activity is in many ways more intriguing and captivating than the main event. The animated throng plays an equal role with the architecture. Touches of vivid colour make up the clothing of the figures, contrasting with the warm, pinkish tones of both the buildings and the earthy ground, and bright sunlight accents some of the details of gesture and dress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Panini seems to have relished the opportunity to depict a wide variety of characters. Some of the people watching may be too poor to participate in the lottery, while others are so wealthy they don't need to. Elegantly dressed ladies and gentlemen enter the scene from either side, on foot or in horse-drawn carriages. While they show little interest in the lottery, several men in black robes at either side of the scene study their tickets. In the left-hand corner, a market seller stands next to a cart full of produce as a number of men climb on the masonry beside him. On the far right, a mother and child sit at the base of the column of Antoninus Pius – which had been excavated nearby and moved to this square – alongside a group of men who drink merrily. Behind this we see the column of Marcus Aurelius, the greatest ancient monument in the area; in reality it would have been just out of view, but Panini has altered the perspective a little in order to include it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work was painted for Cardinal Domenico Orsini according to an inscription on the preparatory drawing now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. His reason for commissioning it is unclear; he was not associated with the lottery and his great-uncle, Pope Benedict XIII, condemned the lottery as an immoral practice in 1725.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Panini was the greatest view painter in eighteenth-century Rome, whether depicting real settings, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOB-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Interior of St Peter’s</a></span> or imaginary scenes like <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FF6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Roman Ruins with Figures</a></span>. This is considered to be one of his most accomplished works and is a rare depiction of this contemporary event in Rome.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two ladies, both dressed in gowns with swagged overskirts that were fashionable in the 1770s, have been brought down to the shore by a man. He is drawing their attention to something, but it is unclear whether he is pointing towards the large ship about to enter the harbour or to the women with their skirts hitched up gathering shrimps. The shrimp women’s undignified poses and muscular physiques form a contrast with the elegant ladies on the shore. The man wears a cylindrical military hat, fur-lined cloak and long leather boots. His scarlet uniform and large moustache identify him as an imagined Hungarian hussar. He carries a walking stick, suggesting that he is retired from active service. The ladies are followed by two other more modestly dressed women, one apparently comforting the other, and by a dark-skinned Moor wearing a turban. As in many of his other paintings, Vernet has placed several figures in the middle distance and background, and even on the three-masted ship near the horizon.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This Italian coastal scene bathed in soft sunlight is clearly influenced by the port scenes of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>, though much of the effect in Vernet’s painting depends upon its picturesque human detail. Commissioned by the comte du Luc and signed and dated 1776, the picture represents an imaginary harbour view. The lighthouse is loosely based on one that Vernet drew near Naples in about 1750 (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Harbour and Lighthouse</span>, Albertina, Vienna) and appears in many other views by him. Although Vernet had on other occasions used the motif seen here of the corner of a fortified wall topped by a turret, the octagonal fort is unusual in his paintings. The decorative frieze of festoons on the fort is echoed in the skirts of the ladies wearing the plumed hats.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the painting contains a variety of figures, its main subject is the atmospheric effects of light, air, cloud and water. The figure group on the left, balanced  by the trees to the right, is silhouetted against the sun and overshadowed by the dark cloud that stretches over the lighthouse.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Marine</span> (sold in Paris on 9 December 1999), which Vernet painted for the comte du Luc in 1772, both formed a single lot in the comte du Luc’s 1777 sale, and remained together until sold in 1825. It has often been assumed that Vernet painted them as a pair and intended them to hang together as pendants. Although both pictures are painted on <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1R-0008-0000-0000.htm">copper</a> – a support used relatively rarely by Vernet – they are slightly different in size and it is not certain whether he intended them as pendants. The gesturing hussar in the group on the left of the National Gallery’s painting echoes a gesturing woman towards the right of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Marine</span>, but there is some difference in the figures’ sizes, and the two paintings do not work as a pair compositionally. Whether or not intended as a pendant for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Marine</span>, the clear bright colours and very smooth surface of the National Gallery’s painting were probably exactly what the comte du Luc expected when he commissioned it to be painted on copper.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This view is taken from the west bank of the Tiber looking towards the Castel Sant’Angelo. The projecting stone platform on which the uniformed musicians play appears in paintings by other artists, so probably existed, whereas the arcaded building with the canopied balcony over it has not been identified and may have been the product of Vernet’s imagination. The ruined remains of the ancient Pons Neronianus (Nero’s Bridge) can be seen in the middle of the river.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The clock on Castel Sant’Angelo reads 8 a.m. but the light would suggest that it is actually mid-morning. The specific event depicted has not been identified but river jousts were a popular entertainment associated with important births and marriages and the visits of monarchs to cities. As Vernet shows, such events attracted crowds of spectators.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The flag at the stern of the boat at the left bears the arms of the then pope, Benedict XIV, incorporating the three vertical red stripes of his family, the Lambertini. Four large Lambertini pennants also fly from poles attached to the Castel Sant’Angelo. There is no coat of arms on the white flag of the right-hand boat, or on the blue flag of the smaller boat in between. The caps worn by the seven rowers in each boat suggest that they are artisans.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the Trumbull sale catalogue of 1797, it was said that the painting included portraits of Vernet, his wife and her father. If so, these may be the three brightly lit figures in the right foreground. Vernet had married Virginia Cecilia Parker, the daughter of the Irishman Mark Parker, a captain of the papal navy, in November 1745. Vernet also included himself in several of his other paintings. However, the man in the rich blue costume said to be Vernet’s father-in-law looks considerably younger than Parker would have been in 1750 and the lady arm-in-arm with the gentleman in red does not resemble Mme Vernet as depicted in Vanloo’s portrait of her of 1768 (Musée Calvet, Avignon).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It has also been suggested that the man in blue is Pierre-Charles de Villette, the first recorded owner of the painting, introducing the Vernets to his elder brother, but there is no evidence that either the Marquis de Villette or his brother was ever in Rome. It is more likely that he is Louis-Jules Barbon Mancini Mazarini, Duke of Nivernais, French ambassador to the Vatican from 1748 to 1752, who commissioned two paintings from Vernet in 1750. The Duke’s extensive household included two Swiss Guards and four trumpeters, who may be those included on the platform and to the left of Vernet’s painting. If this is so, then the woman accompanying Vernet may be Hélène-Françoise-Angélique Phélypeaux de Pontchartrain, who had married the Duke in 1731.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This was one of four paintings sent from Rome by Vernet to the Paris <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1750. Vernet’s work was influenced by the seventeenth-century painters <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Claude</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Poussin</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ORX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dughet</a>, who had established the classical landscape tradition.</p></div>
