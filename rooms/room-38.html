        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The key figure in this painting’s narrative is Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa (63?‒12 BC), general, statesman, architect and close friend to Augustus Caesar, who reigned as the first Roman Emperor from 27 BC. Agrippa moves up the stairs of his impressive villa and away from the petitioners making their requests below, and the objects assembled on the landing. The details of the image are painstakingly represented, from the dramatic fall of Agrippa’s red cape, the wide expanses of marble, to the objects laid over the tiger skin. The crowd of people on the right demonstrate the artist’s abilities in capturing variations of emotion.

This underscores Alma-Tadema’s desire for his work to be current and historically accurate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The arm of the statue gestures above the offerings and draws the viewer’s eye to the atrium above where the soldiers, or servants, hold fasces. These were bundles of sticks bound together with an axe head protruding. It was a symbol of Ancient Rome that had survived into the modern world, as a representation of collective power, law, and governance. In the distance the visible blue sky indicates the open nature of the villa.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was created to impress Sir William Armstrong, a wealthy Newcastle engineer and industrialist, who had admired Alma-Tadema’s earlier work <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Audience with Agrippa</span> when it was exhibited to great acclaim at the Royal Academy in 1876. Rather than repeat the composition, the artist chose to represent the moment at the end of the ‘audience’ with the figure of Agrippa walking up the stairs away from the landing, rather than towards it, as in the earlier painting. This later work is more complex and ambitious.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was very well received when it was first exhibited at the Royal Scottish Academy in 1879.</p></div>

The view looks out through a barred window onto a blue sky streaked with wisps of white cloud, with no features of town of country visible. On the grey stone windowsill a few stalks of straw are scattered. To the right the first few links of a heavy chain are set in the wall. The artist has portrayed a spider’s web just beyond the bars, its delicate threads stretching from top to bottom. Every damage and crack are rendered, from the deep fissures caused by the bars themselves to chips along the front of the ledge. Yet for all the detail, the work is thinly painted with the pale ground showing through throughout.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of views from windows onto townscapes or landscapes has a long tradition, notably in religious works of the Northern Renaissance. During the Romantic era Friedrich established such images as subjects in their own right, the window depicted as a gateway to the world beyond, often combined with a contemplative figure seen from the back. But here Carus was not aiming to paint the scene through the window, but the window itself, its frame and bars. And it is no studio or domestic window. The patch of sky seen from behind bars, the thick wall, the chain and the blades of straw, perhaps from the floor or escaped from bedding all evoke a prison cell. The artist’s signature incised into the stone perhaps evokes the scratchings by prisoners onto the walls of their cells. And this sense of imprisonment is echoed in the web beyond, a symbol of life or a trap waiting on the other side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Carus is possibly remembering his own views of the barred windows of church ruins. Such a subject also reflects recent events of the Napoleonic Wars, Dresden itself being the site of Napoleon’s last major victory in August 1813. It is perhaps even a reference to Beethoven’s opera <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fidelio</span>, performed in Dresden in 1823, which recounted the story of the rescue of a political prisoner from prison. More universally, the window here is not the means through which to observe and depict a view of the outside world, instead it functions as a boundary between interior and exterior, dark and light, imprisonment and liberty. Ultimately the picture addresses the dialogue between fear and hope, captivity and freedom, both physical and psychological.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait is one of the first painted by Jacques-Louis David (1748–1825) when he chose exile in Brussels in 1816 following the fall of Napoleon, whom he had supported, and the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy. Isolated from Paris, David relied mainly on painting portraits of Brussels citizens and fellow Napoleonic émigrés to earn a living.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">David rarely painted portraits of families and children. Here he captures the affection between the Comtesse, Sophie, and her five-year-old daughter, Marie-Louise, but without sentimentality or idealisation. This restraint and realism are echoed in the plain background and absence of lavish accessories or furnishings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Comtesse Vilain XIIII had formerly been a lady-in-waiting to the Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon’s second wife, and had attended the baptism of their son, Napoleon II, the King of Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are only two paintings by David in Britain – this, and the National Gallery’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of Jacobus Blauw</span>.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacques-Louis David painted portraits throughout his career, but family portraits, including those of mothers and children, are rare. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of the Comtesse Vilain XIIII and her Daughter</span> dates from 1816, the first year of David’s exile in Brussels following the fall of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TO5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Napoleon</a>, whom David had supported. Images of motherhood and maternal affection had been popular in French art since the 1780s. However, unlike such precedents, David’s picture does not depict a full embrace or kiss, but is an unsentimental scene of restrained affection rather than overt emotion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Comtesse, Sophie, and her five-year-old daughter, Marie-Louise, form a simple triangle set within a shallow space. A number of subtle echoes and contrasts are at work within this basic format: mother and daughter have almost identical hairstyles and wear similar dresses. The seated Comtesse is static and contemplative, her gaze focused on a distant point beyond the viewer. Marie-Louise’s pose, however, hints at movement. Standing, she leans back into her mother’s lap while tilting her head slightly in the opposite direction. Unlike her mother’s, her gaze directly meets our own. This combination of complementary active and passive elements is particularly evident in the hands. As Marie-Louise clasps her mother’s right hand with her right hand, the gesture is reversed on their left where it is Marie-Louise’s hand that is being held.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the physical connection between mother and daughter, their interaction is subdued. David reinforces the impression of the Comtesse supporting her young daughter by draping the orange cloak over the chair and around the Comtesse’s right arm. The orange cloth complements the deep Prussian blue of the dress and brings warmth to the picture. These vivid and intense areas of colour, laid down in thin glazes, also reflect the impact of David’s renewed acquaintance with Flemish painting during his Belgian exile. David includes a variety of materials and fabrics, such as lace, linen and velvet. However, the absence of jewellery is noteworthy. Tellingly perhaps, given the political climate after Napoleon’s fall, the Comtesse does not wear the lavish necklace he had given her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like David, the Comtesse Vilain XIIII was connected to the Napoleonic cause. Her husband, Philippe Vilain XIIII had been Mayor of Ghent and was ennobled by Napoleon in 1811 (the numerals XIIII originated from an ancestor who had presented the keys to  Ghent to Louis XVI). The Comtesse herself had formerly been lady-in-waiting to the Empress Marie-Louise, Napoleon’s second wife, after whom she named her daughter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Comtesse most likely commissioned the portrait directly from David, and five letters she wrote to her husband between May and July 1816 provide a rare insight into David’s working method. Complaining about the long sittings, typically over four hours, in the painter’s studio and of David’s meticulous approach, the Comtesse – who was pregnant with her fourth child – noted, ‘I must admit that the whole things is becoming boring’ and that she did not find the ‘wretched’ David appealing. Significantly, the letters make no mention of her daughter. Close examination of the painting reveals that she was a late, but easily accommodated, addition. Despite the lack of rapport between sitter and artist, the Comtesse declared that she was very pleased with the finished picture.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delacroix depicts a moment from the Crucifixion, recounted in the Gospel of John (19: 25–30), when Christ speaks to his mother, the Virgin Mary, and one of his disciples, John, just before he dies. Christ’s mother, dressed in blue and yellow robes, collapses into the arms of Mary Cleophas and John. At the foot of the cross, Mary Magdalene prays as she looks up at Christ. Unusually, Delacroix also includes Judas Iscariot  in the lower right corner.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delacroix places us among the group at the foot of the Cross, as we too look up at Christ’s body. The use of colour is especially powerful as the greenish-grey pallor of Christ’s body is echoed by the greys and pinkish-browns of the stormy sky. The agitated brushwork combines expressive energy with the immediacy of a sketch.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Delacroix</a> depicts a moment described in Gospel of John, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> addresses his mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, and one of his disciples, John, just before he dies (John 19: 25–30). Christ’s mother, dressed in distinctive blue and yellow robes, collapses into the arms of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Cleophas</a> and John. At the foot of the cross, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> prays as she looks up at Christ. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas Iscariot</a> is not normally shown in such scenes, but Delacroix includes him in the lower right corner. Judas now understands the consequences of his betrayal of Christ. Two Roman soldiers in the mid-distance on the left observe the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite the relatively small size of the canvas, Delacroix achieves great dramatic effect by placing the viewer at the same level as the figures compressed together in the lower right-hand corner as we, too, look up at Christ’s body. By reducing the landscape to a narrow band, Delacroix gives further emphasis to the human drama of their reactions. The greenish-grey pallor of Christ’s body is particularly striking and is amplified by the greys and pinkish-browns of the stormy sky that fills most of the picture. The red robes echo the blood flowing from Christ’s wounds. In many of Delacroix’s later paintings, rigid distinctions between a sketch and a finished painting can be blurred. In this picture, the agitated quality of the brushwork – which ranges from thin wisps to thick clots of paint – gives the painting the immediacy of a sketch and an expressive energy that animates the entire canvas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Throughout his life, Delacroix studied and made copies of Old Master paintings. Most pertinent to this picture was the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> The Coup de lance</span> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q6P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rubens</a> (1620, Musée Royal des Beaux-Arts, Antwerp) which Delacroix copied twice from memory, possibly following his second trip to Belgium in 1850. This admiration for Rubens was part of Delacroix’s wider appreciation of the often deeply expressive religious paintings of Northern European artists,  including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacob Jordaens</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PZF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rembrandt</a>. The critic Théophile Gautier also noted a more contemporary reference, to <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ on the Cross</span> (Louvre, Paris) by Pierre-Paul Prud‘hon, that had been exhibited at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1822.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delacroix depicted stories and incidents from the Bible many times, but the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> was a subject to which he often returned, especially in his later years. He had previously exhibited a larger version of the Crucifixion, showing Christ between the two thieves (Musée des Beaux-Arts, Vannes), at the Salon of 1835 and had exhibited another Crucifixion at the Salon of 1847 in which a more centrally placed Christ is the primary focus (Walters Art Museum, Baltimore). Several oil and pastel sketches were also produced in the late 1840s. This version of the Crucifixion shows that Delacroix was still exploring new ways of rendering the subject in the 1850s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The critic and poet Charles Baudelaire, Delacroix’s greatest champion and most perceptive contemporary viewer, claimed that Delacroix created genuinely authentic religious art because of the affinity between his temperament and the true sentiment of Christianity: ’perhaps he alone, in this century of nonbelievers, has created religious paintings that were neither empty nor cold, like some works created for competition, nor pedantic, nor mystical, nor neo-Christian ... the genuine sadness for which he had a flair was perfectly suited to our religion, a profoundly sad religion.'</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lady Jane Grey reigned for just nine days as Queen of England following the death of Edward VI in July 1553: she was deposed by the faction supporting Edward’s half-sister and heir, the Catholic Mary Tudor. Tried for treason, the 17-year-old Lady Jane was beheaded at Tower Green on 12 February 1554.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the catalogue for the 1834 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a>, where the painting was first exhibited, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PGJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Delaroche</a> quoted from a text about Protestant martyrs, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Martyrologe des protestants</span>, which was published in 1558. Describing her final moments, the excerpt tells how the blindfolded Lady Jane pleaded, ‘What shall I do? Where is the block?’ It is this moment that the painting shows, as the helpless Lady Jane is guided to the execution block by Sir John Brydges, Lieutenant of the Tower. Her outer clothing has already been removed and is gathered in the lap of a lady-in-waiting, who has slumped to the ground. Behind her, a second lady-in-waiting stands facing the wall, unable to watch. To the right, a fifth figure, the executioner, stands waiting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delaroche uses a dark monochrome background of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Romanesque</a> architecture as a foil for the illuminated life-size figures – in particular the group in the centre-right – and the rich reds, browns and blacks of their clothing. Lady Jane is the visual focus of the painting, as the bright sheen of her satin petticoat (its radiant whiteness symbolising her innocence), pale skin and gleam of her wedding ring stand out from the oppressive gloom. No one in the picture looks at us, and nothing, except for the brightly-lit straw laid down to soak up the blood, comes between us and what is about to happen. The smooth finish of the paint and its lack of visible brushwork further enhance the illusion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The early decades of the nineteenth century saw the spread of new forms of visual spectacle. These included panoramas, in which enormous paintings that completely surrounded the viewer were displayed in rotundas, and dioramas, where paintings were shown within a rotating cylindrical auditorium with the added drama of spectacular light effects. Delaroche was almost certainly aware of these immersive optical experiences when he composed this picture. He had also previously explored the techniques of creating visual spectacle himself when he made preparatory models while planning his paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another popular entertainment in French theatres, which Delaroche would have seen, was the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tableau vivant</span> – ‘a living picture’ in which actors, appropriately costumed and theatrically lit, silently held poses. Delaroche had close connections with Paris theatres, and the small cast of life-size figures, raised platform and historical props give this painting the look of a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">tableau vivant</span>. The likely model for Lady Jane was a famous actress from the Comédie–Français, Mademoiselle Anaïs, who was well known for her blonde hair and slight figure, and with whom Delaroche was romantically involved. Delaroche creates a highly theatrical stage-like space at which we have a front row seat. Forced to acknowledge what is about to happen, we must make a choice between looking or looking away. This choice is already taking place in the painting itself, as the three women either turn away or are unable to see, leaving only the two men as witnesses.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delaroche’s extensive preparatory drawings reveal how he reduced the composition to its core elements, trying out a variety of poses. These include seated, standing, kneeling and leaning figures who are variously presented frontally, half-turning or else fully turned away, displaying a range of emotional responses – horror, fear and pity. The drawings show how Delaroche was particularly preoccupied with Lady Jane and the executioner. Taking his cue from the historical source he cited in the catalogue, Delaroche specifically focuses on Lady Jane’s moment of faltering hesitation as, ‘crying piteously,’ she tentatively searches for the block, her outstretched arms gently guided by Sir John’s hands. Hands play an important role in the picture, as Delacroche uses expressive gestures to give insight into the psychological state of each character. In a highly finished watercolour sketch of 1832, a stockier version of the executioner, who holds a large broadsword, stands to the side, as if merely waiting to complete his task. However, in the painting the sword has been replaced by an axe, and the figure of brute state authority had evolved into one whose pose and facial expression suggest some degree of compassion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When first exhibited at the Paris Salon of 1834, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Execution of Lady Jane Grey</span> was an immediate sensation. Although not historically accurate in many details – for example, the execution actually took place outdoors not inside, as shown here – the painting’s combination of intense melodrama and realism proved extremely popular with the public. Crowds gathered in front of the picture and pressed forward, eager to get close to it. Some critics were less enthusiastic, however, claiming it was too theatrical and that Delaroche had based the composition on another painting, John Opie’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mary Queen of Scots</span>, which he knew from an engraving. This division between public and critical responses shows the mixed reception the painting has always received. Despite its original fame, the picture was forgotten for much of the twentieth century. For decades, it was thought to have been destroyed in the Thames flood of 1928. Following its chance rediscovery in the basement of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PIC-0001-0000-0000.htm">Tate Gallery</a> in 1973, it was exhibited two years later at the National Gallery, where it continues to be one of the most popular paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Delaroche’s choice of British subject matter reflects the French fascination with English culture in the 1820s and 1830s. He had visited Britain at least twice before 1834, and in 1831 had painted a violent episode from English history that took place in the Tower of London: the murder of the two young sons of Edward IV on the order of Richard III in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Children of Edward</span> (Louvre, Paris). Contemporary French viewers would also have been alert to the parallels between Tudor history and relatively recent events in France after the Revolution of 1789 – most obviously, the similar fates of Lady Jane Grey and the French royal family (including Marie-Antoinette), who had faced the guillotine in 1793. Delaroche turns an event from British history into a compelling visual spectacle that also served as a commentary on France’s recent and bloody past.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jean-Louis-André-Théodore Géricault was a keen horseman, and his passion for horses was matched by his expert understanding of their anatomy. Unlike England, France did not have an established tradition of horse painting. However, there were French artists who specialised in painting horses – such as the fashionable Carle Vernet, himself an avid horseman and with whom the young Géricault had trained – and a market for these pictures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Géricault painted this picture in 1813 or 1814, soon after he had successfully exhibited a huge canvas, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Charging Chasseur</span> (also known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Officer of the Imperial Horse Guard Charging</span>, Louvre, Paris) at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Salon</a> of 1812, for which he was awarded a gold medal. In 1813 he produced a number of oil studies and finished paintings of horses at the Imperial stables at Versailles, possibly including this one, showing them either in groups or individually. In contrast to the action and movement of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Charging Chasseur</span>, these paintings are characterised by close observation and detailed naturalism.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this picture we see a fine thoroughbred, possibly of Arabian stock. Géricault has shown the moment it reacts to a bolt of lightning (in the upper right corner), and presumably the accompanying clap of thunder. He avoided the more dramatic, and perhaps rather clichéd, image of a horse rearing, instead showing the animal in profile as it freezes in fear. Only its startled eye – the white just visible – and the trace of drool from its mouth suggest its terror. Géricault brilliantly captured the sheen of its dappled coat as it is momentarily lit up against the near blackness of the night sky. He used short, staccato strokes of liquid paint, which precisely follow the contours of the horse’s body, to create an effect of nervous energy that ripples across its silky surface.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike the pictures of horses in their stables at Versailles, Gericault has excluded any human presence or incidental detail, such as riding equipment or an identifiable location. Instead, his attention – and ours – is entirely focused on the horse. Filling the picture space, it exists beyond passing changes in fashion and style. Like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PRA-0001-0000-0000.htm">George Stubbs</a>’s masterpiece <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Whistlejacket</a></span>, Gericault’s painting is a portrait of a specific horse, with its own distinct characteristics, rather than a generic study of a type or breed. Although showing a frightened animal, Géricault has avoided sentimentalism. Nor has he humanised its reaction to the lightning. But like Stubbs’s picture, his precise observation of this particular horse also draws upon classical precedents. The side view recalls classical friezes, whose impact upon Géricault’s paintings of horses and of horse racing was to become more pronounced when he visited Italy between 1816 and 1817.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Andrés del Peral sits proudly on a simple chair and looks out at us with a penetrating stare. This is an intimate portrait and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Goya</a> shows Peral as he really was, with a receding hairline and grey hair. He looks as if he’s sneering at us, but his facial droop suggests he may have suffered a stroke. He places his left hand on his hip and the right is tucked into his waistcoat, a gesture commonly found in portraiture at this date.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A friend and contemporary of Goya, Peral was an accomplished <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilder</a> – like Goya’s father – and he worked in that capacity for the royal court in Madrid from the late 1770s to the early 1820s. Peral was a collector and he even owned a few small paintings by Goya of bullfighting and genre scenes. In 1798 the two of them were employed – as gilder and court painter respectively – in decorating the royal chapel of San Antonio de la Florida, on the outskirts of Madrid. Goya was commissioned to paint <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> and Peral to gild the altars and frames.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait probably dates from that time, and may have been intended as a gift for Peral. It was exhibited at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid in summer 1798, where it was highly praised for its sense of immediacy. In a review in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Diario de Madrid</span> an anonymous art critic wrote that this portrait ‘would be enough by itself to bring credit to a whole Academy, to a whole nation, to a whole contemporary period with respect to prosperity, so sure is its draughtsmanship, its taste in colouring, its freedom...’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Goya’s use of colour is subtle and delicate, his brushstrokes confident and at times even flamboyant. Our eye is drawn to the luxurious sheen of Peral’s silvery coat, and the striped waistcoat decorated with flowers beneath it. The coat is thinly painted, and Goya allows the brown priming to show through in places to convey the texture of the cloth’s shimmering surface. The flowers on his waistcoat are painted with swift strokes of blue pushed into the still wet paint of the fabric.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Goya’s masterful painting technique and his very truthful representation of Peral make this one of his most memorable portraits.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a portrait of Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, one of the leading military and political figures in nineteenth-century Britain, who served twice as Prime Minister. In 1808, the French army invaded Spain and installed a new king: Joseph I, brother of the French emperor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TO5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Napoleon</a>. The Peninsular War (1808–1814) followed, a period of brutal conflict between the French and the Spanish, Portuguese and British troops. This portrait was painted shortly after Wellington’s victorious entry into Madrid in August 1812, following his defeat of the French forces at the Battle of Salamanca; a turning point in the war which eventually led to Napoleon’s exile and the restoration of the Spanish monarchy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Goya</a> was clearly the portraitist of choice for such a prestigious sitter, for he had been employed as court painter for some years. Wellington must have sat for Goya shortly after his arrival in Madrid, and the artist produced a large portrait of the Duke on horseback (Apsley House, London), a drawing (British Museum, London) and our painting on panel. The equestrian portrait was publicly exhibited in September 1812 at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Madrid, where Goya was director. The drawing and this head-and-shoulders portrait may have been painted in preparation for the larger work, though they might also have been made independently.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Wellington was a short man and Goya paints him in an upright pose with his head held high, as if wishing to appear taller. The simplicity of the composition focuses our attention on Wellington’s face. This is not the look of a triumphant man: his face is gaunt and exhausted from battle, contrasting with his impressive array of medals and the bright crimson military uniform he wears.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although this portrait was probably painted directly from life, Goya later altered Wellington’s pose and made significant changes to the composition as the Duke was awarded the different medals and military orders he wears here. On his chest we see the badges of the Order of the Bath (top), awarded in 1804; the Tower and Sword of Portugal (lower left), received in 1811; and the San Fernando of Spain (lower right), bestowed a year later. Across his right shoulder he wears the blue sash of the Tower and Sword with the pink sash of the Order of Bath over it – these were added during painting and forced Goya to make several adjustments (including moving some of the medals and his gold buttons).  Wellington wears the Order of the Golden Fleece (a prestigious chivalric order) around his neck, which must have been added after the portrait was begun: the Duke only heard that he had been awarded this in August 1812. Finally, he wears the Military Gold Cross with a three-clasp brooch, suspended on a pink and blue ribbon. This decoration was only introduced in October 1813 – well after Wellington had sat for this portrait – and the gold clasps represented the battles in which the officer had fought. Wellington went on to earn nine clasps in all, but here he is shown with just three – those that he would have earned by the summer of 1812, when he supposedly sat for Goya.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait appears to have been painted with extraordinary speed and energy. Goya has left a brown priming layer exposed to create a contrast between lighter and darker areas in some parts of the painting; this is especially obvious in the eyes and mouth. The medals and decorations the Duke wears are very freely painted but easily identifiable. The lion at the centre of the Military Gold Cross, for example, is just hinted at with a single stroke of yellow paint but we can make out its shape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are other portraits by Goya in our collection, including that of his friend <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FL1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Don Andrés del Peral</a></span>, as well as a female portrait, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Doña Isabel de Porcel</a></span>, long thought to be by the artist.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">William Holman Hunt was one of the founders of a group of English painters called the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood. The group was influenced by the bold colours, intricate compositions and complex messages of Italian fifteenth-century art. In the lower right of this painting, Hunt has added the initials PRB for Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a scene from the life of Nicola Gabrini (1313–1354), known as Cola di Rienzo (or Rienzi). He was an Italian politician from Rome. In 1344 he led a revolt in Rome and declared himself its leader, the Tribune of Rome. He styled himself as the natural child of the Holy Roman Emperor. In fact, he was from a humble background. It was his revolt against an aristocratic elite, and his demands for the end of the powers of the Pope and for the reunification of Italy, that made him a liberal hero in the nineteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is based on <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Rienzi, The Last of the Tribunes</span> (1835), a novel by the British writer Edward Bulwer-Lytton. It is dedicated to Alessandro Manzoni, the father of the historical novel in Italy. Rienzi is holding his fist to the sky. He is vowing revenge for the death of his brother whom he holds on his lap. During a skirmish with their enemies, the Orsini family, he has been killed accidentally by his allies, the Colonna. In Lytton’s novel, this moment puts Rienzi on the path that leads to him becoming the ruler of Rome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Hunt started the picture in 1848. It was a year that saw largely unsuccessful revolutions across Europe. The family of Hunt’s friend and fellow artist, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, had fled from Naples because of their advocacy of Italian unification. In his memoirs, Hunt would claim that at this time he was inspired by the ideals of freedom against oppression that swept Europe. This painting, therefore, has a revolutionary message about the overthrow of tyranny and the power of people to decide their fate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The futile death of this young man, and its inherent tragedy, is also a theme. Rienzi’s brother lies on his sword. The hilt points out of the painting towards the viewer. He has a garland of flowers around his wrist. Flowers held meanings for nineteenth-century artists. Hunt has included two flowers, a red anemone and a blue hyacinth, that were symbols of tragedy. Also in the bouquet are daisies, which symbolised innocence. The misery of the scene is emphasised by the mourning woman and children on the hill to the left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was also revolutionary in its creation. Hunt painted much of the landscape from nature, working out of doors on Hampstead Heath. Rienzi’s face is based on drawings of Dante Gabriel Rossetti. The knight on the far left is based on drawings of his brother, William Michael Rossetti. These both link the painting to ideals of Italian reunification as well as to the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene shown here is taken from the sixteenth-century epic poem <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Orlando Furioso</span>, by Ludovico Ariosto. Published in full in 1532, the poem is an epic tale of chivalric romance set against the struggle between Charlemagne’s Christian warriors and the Saracen army invading Europe. Its central story tells of the unrequited love of a Christian knight, Orlando, for a pagan princess, Angelica.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ingres has depicted an episode from Canto X when a heroic knight, Ruggiero (translated as Roger or Rogero in English), discovers Angelica, who has been abducted by barbarians. Stripped and chained to a rock on the Isle of Tears, she has been left as a sacrifice to a sea monster. Riding a hippogriff – a legendary half-horse, half-griffin beast that can both gallop and fly – Ruggiero saves Angelica by plunging his lance into the monster’s open jaws.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ingres had previously painted this scene in a larger painting (now in the Louvre, Paris) that he submitted to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5F-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paris Salon</a>of 1819. In this later version, he recreates the fantasy landscape of jagged rocks and foaming sea illuminated by moonlight and by a small beacon at the top of the picture. However, here he gives greater focus to the principal action by reducing the width of the picture, removing much of the seascape backdrop on either side, and by placing the monster between Ruggiero and Angelica. Although the canvas is small, Ingres paints specific areas – such as the gold armour, silk cloak and griffin’s feathers – in meticulous detail. This, combined with an emphasis on pattern and outline, recalls the style and flat design of icon paintings (religious works made for the Eastern Orthodox Church). The echo is reinforced by the fact that Ruggiero is a Christian knight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bathed in moonlight, Angelica’s pale skin stands out against the dark sea and rocks. Ingres creates an almost tactile contrast between her exposed and vulnerable body and the various hard surfaces – the armour and rocks – and the sharp objects – the lance, griffin’s beak and talons, and monster’s teeth – that surround her. Angelica’s sinuous outline is modelled on a classical <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>. However, Ingres exaggerates the length of her limp arms and the backward tilt of her neck and swollen throat for greater expressive effect.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story of Ruggiero and Angelica had parallels with other classical and Christian stories, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Perseus and Andromeda</a> (Ingres’s initial idea for the painting) and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQV-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint George</a> and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EE3-0008-0000-0000.htm">dragon</a>. However, the picture’s narrative of a chivalric knight also had contemporary political resonance. The original painting had been commissioned for Louis XVIII to hang in the Throne Room at Versailles. It served there as a reminder of the authority of the French monarchy and of Christian values in response to a resurgent Muslim Ottoman Empire. But Ingres’s decision to paint additional versions of the original picture, including this one, suggests that the image of a heroic knight rescuing a defenceless woman also had personal significance for him.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Ingres was commissioned to paint this portrait in 1844, two years after the sitter, Marie Clotilde-Inès de Foucauld, had married the wealthy banker, Sigisbert Moitessier. He was initially reluctant to accept the commission, but changed his mind after meeting the 23-year-old Madame Moitessier, whom he described as ‘beautiful and good’. Nonetheless, it took him 12 years to complete the painting. The delay was partly caused by the need to finish other commissions and by the death of Ingres’s wife in 1849. The death of Madame Moitessier’s father, also in 1849, and her pregnancy with her second child further extended the delay.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During this time the painting underwent major revisions, often with the active collaboration of Madame Moitessier. The initial plan was to include the sitter’s four-year-old daughter, Catherine, leaning against her mother’s knees. Frustrated by the child’s inability to keep still, Ingres removed her from the composition and also moved Madame Moitessier to the picture’s centre by realigning the canvas on its stretcher. While these extensive changes were being made, Ingres painted a second portrait. Completed relatively quickly in 1851, this is a more solemn picture of Madame Moitessier wearing a black ball gown as she stands at a mantelpiece (now in the National Gallery of Art, Washington).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Despite these delays, it’s likely that Ingres decided upon Madame Moitessier’s pose right from the start. It is adopted from a Roman mural, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Herakles finding his son Telephos</span>, which includes the goddess of Arcadia seated upon a throne. The mural had been discovered in Herculaneum in 1739 and was subsequently moved to the Museo Borbinico in Naples. Ingres almost certainly saw it when he visited the city in 1814, and he also owned engravings of it. In the portrait, he uses the gesture of Arcadia’s right hand, with its index finger raised, supporting her head. Preparatory drawings show how he gave great attention to the precise positioning of Madame Moitessier’s right arm, hand and fingers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Women’s fashions had undergone significant changes in the time it took to complete the portrait, and Ingres had to make several revisions to Madame Moitessier’s clothes to prevent the portrait from looking dated when he finished it. Having first selected a dark and then a yellow dress, he finally chose one of lavish floral chintz made from Lyonnaise silk. Its pinkish-reds and blues are echoed in the vase on the left, and its distinctive floral design repeated in the ornate flowers, buds and leaves of the picture’s elaborate gilded frame. The dress is supported by a crinoline – a stiffened or structured petticoat that increased its volume. A radical innovation in women’s fashion that had only been introduced the previous year, the crinoline spread the dress out, enabling Ingres to fully display the material. Madame Moitessier’s hairstyle, with the hair pulled back off the brow to reveal her full face, was also new and, by revealing a glimpse of the ear, provocative too. Ingres skilfully depicts the tones and textures of different fabrics, while the impression of opulence is amplified by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> – and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a>-style jewellery. Ingres paints these jewels in meticulous detail, the purple and red of the amethysts and garnets in the bracelets, brooch and headpiece echoing the reds and pinks used throughout the picture. Here, especially, the oil paint has the smoothness and brilliance of enamel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Madame Moitessier’s fashionable dress and hairstyle are complemented by the room’s furnishings. A revival of the highly decorative earlier <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Rococo</a> style was at its height in mid-nineteenth century France. This was the era of the Second Empire, which saw the restoration of the imperial throne and an extravagant display of wealth. The room has the ambiance of a luxurious eighteenth-century salon with its Japanese Imari vase, silk hand-screen, ornate fan, Louis XV console table, gilded mirror frame and padded damask sofa (with a tiny cupid peeking over Madame Moitessier’s left shoulder). This is a picture of flowing lines and curves, as the sinuous line extending from Madame Moitessier’s right elbow to her seemingly boneless hand and fingers is echoed by the table leg, just as its contour is repeated by the curved back of the sofa. Her languid left arm is echoed by the ribbons that spill down the dress.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Madame Moitessier herself is placed high within the painting. This not only allows Ingres to fill almost a third of the picture with her sumptuous dress – and display his virtuoso skill in painting it – but it also gives her an aura of majesty as, self-assured and serene, she calmly gazes upon us. By posing her against a dark mirror, Ingres also offers us a double portrait: one that is frontal and one in profile. However, closer inspection of the mirror reveals some oddities. The reflection is not entirely consistent with her actual position. It also lacks the detail and luminosity of the figure, its dull surface contrasting with the opulence of Madame Moitessier and her surroundings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Further scrutiny reveals other inconsistencies in the picture’s construction. The area containing the mirror, sofa and table is too cramped for them, while the reflection does not match what we would expect to see. For example, the small cupid has no mirror image, but the decorative carving on which it is mounted does. The reflection of the room’s doors and panels and, yet more confusingly, the reflection of the mirror facing Madame Moitessier in the mirror behind her, further add to this ambiguity. These ‘distortions’ are part of Ingres’s deliberate manipulation of pictorial space.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Madame Moitessier is a fine example of Ingres’s late style in its combination of sumptuous visual display, extraordinary technical skill, compositional complexity and psychological presence. However, Ingres often complained about the numerous requests he received for ‘wretched portraits’, claiming they prevented him from pursuing what he thought was more important – historical and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F2R-0008-0000-0000.htm">allegorical</a> paintings. Madame Moitessier presented a possible solution to this dilemma, as the painting enabled him to combine contemporary portraiture with elements of history painting, in particular its classical forms and references. Indeed, for Ingres, Madame Moitessier was a living embodiment of the classical ideal. A modern-day goddess enthroned in luxury, she sits impassively, fully confident of her place in society.</p></div>

He is presented  as a reserved, even forbidding, figure who closely scrutinises us as we look at him. Norvins’ loyalty to Napoleon is indicated by the gesture of placing his left hand inside his jacket, just like the Emperor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, following Napoleon’s fall from power in 1814 and the restoration of the monarchy, any overt evidence of loyalty to him would have been potentially damaging to both Norvins and Ingres, which led Ingres to make some changes. He added a length of red drapery to conceal what was probably a bust of Napoleon’s infant son, the King of Rome, which you can now see as a ghostly presence if you look closely at the left of the picture. As if to compensate for the lost bust, Ingres added a bronze sculpture of the Roman goddess, Minerva, on the right.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At first glance, the rather formal pose and opulent setting might suggest this is a portrait of a wealthy individual or perhaps an aristocrat. But as is often the case with Ingres, there is more going on in this painting than might at first appear. The sitter, Monsieur de Norvins, had been appointed Chief of Police in Rome (then under French rule) in January 1811, the year in which the portrait was painted. However, subsequent political events led him to make changes to it. Clues to these changes are visible in the picture – but only if we look closely.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monsieur de Norvins is presented as a reserved and rather forbidding figure. Leaning on a chair, his pose is immovable, its rigidity echoed by the vertical line of the curtain on his right. His arms are held tight against his body, and he does not smile. Instead, his thin lips, framed by a hint of stubble, are slightly pursed, as if he is thinking or coming to a decision. His large eyes look directly at us, holding us in his sidelong gaze. Norvins’ black suit further adds to the severe mood of the painting, but it also creates a sharp contrast with the brilliant white of his collar and shirt cuffs. The only colour on his clothing is from the vivid band of red ribbon indicating he is a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour. This flash of red also picks up on the deep maroon of the damask fabric on the wall and chair. Ingres confidently displays his skill in rendering the qualities of different materials, such as the shadows in the folds of the jacket’s black cloth and the ribbon’s sheen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Norvins was a supporter of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TO5-0001-0000-0000.htm">Emperor Napoleon</a> – and later wrote a very successful four-volume biography of him – and his political allegiance is shown by the Napoleonic gesture of placing his left hand inside his jacket. Following the fall of Napoleon in April 1814 and the return to power of the Bourbon monarchy, any evidence of overt loyalty to the former Emperor would have been potentially harmful to Norvins’ political career and to Ingres, as an ambitious young artist. Ingres responded to this new political situation by repainting parts of the canvas. In addition to minor reworking around Norvins' collar and head, which was originally slightly higher, he painted a length of red drapery, which spills over the chair, on the left of picture. This was to hide a bust, resting on a tall pedestal, which had originally been placed in the upper left corner. The bust was most likely of the King of Rome, the infant son of Napoleon, born in March 1811. Because oil paint thins over time, the bust is now visible as a ghostly presence beneath the drapery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As if to compensate for the lost bust, Ingres added a bronze sculpture – copied after a marble in the Vatican – of the Roman goddess, Minerva, on the right of the picture. On the pedestal beneath it, the letters ROM refer to Norvins’ position in Rome. As Ingres painted within the limited space available, both the bust and inscription are awkwardly cropped. The red wallpaper is also now clearly visible through the thin overpainting.</p></div>

Abraham and his son make their way to the place of sacrifice. Abraham strides up the mountainside with steely resolve, his eyes on the path ahead. Isaac carries a bundle of wood for the altar fire on his back, while his father holds a lighted torch and a knife. When Isaac asks his father where is the lamb to be sacrificed, Abraham replies that the Lord will provide.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the next episode of the story, Abraham places Isaac on the altar and is about to kill him when an angel appears and tells him not to harm the child. God sends a ram in a thicket to be sacrificed as a burnt offering instead of Isaac and the boy is saved. This episode in the Old Testament is frequently interpreted as a precursor for God’s sacrifice of his own son, Jesus, recounted in the New Testament.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The style of the painting is deliberately old fashioned, with precise outlines and odd disparities in scale, while the figures of Abraham and Isaac recall the simplified forms of a medieval <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPC-0008-0000-0000.htm">woodcut</a>.

The distant mountain peak may perhaps be the Watzmann, to the south of the city. However Olivier’s approach to depicting the landscape, with slim feathery trees and pink tinged clouds in the blue sky, also recalls the backgrounds of Italian <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> paintings, such as those by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1817 Olivier became a member of the Brotherhood of Saint Luke, an artistic brotherhood (later known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nazarenes</a>) founded in Vienna in 1809 by Friedrich Overbeck and Franz Pforr.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject of this painting is taken from the Old Testament Book of Ruth. The youthful widowed Moabite Ruth is gleaning (gathering up grain left after the harvest) to support her widowed mother-in-law, Naomi. The landowner Boaz has come to show his admiration for her support for her family. He has heard of her situation and instructed his workers to leave lots of grain for her to gather. He encourages her to work in his fields throughout the harvest.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Behind Ruth a woman cuts grain with a scythe and watches the conversation. Other workers tie the sheaves while another group of figures – one of them drinking from a flagon – rest in the shade of some trees in the distance. On the far left are the walls of Bethlehem. Ruth holds out a handful of grain to Boaz, whose palm is open in a rhetorical gesture to show that he is speaking to her. The colours are pure and clear and the painting is very precise and highly finished, giving it a polished, porcelain-like quality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Naomi told Ruth that Boaz was a close relative, who under Jewish law had the right to marry her now that she was widowed. They eventually married, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FA0-0008-0000-0000.htm">King David</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Jesus</a> were among their descendants. Ruth’s meeting with Boaz has been regarded as a prefiguration of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Based on drawings made a few years earlier in Italy, the picture was actually painted in Munich, where from 1828 <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q9B-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schnorr von Carolsfeld</a> was a painter at the court of King Ludwig of Bavaria. Schnorr had spent ten years in Italy, and was a leading figure in a group of German and Austrian artists called the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FKJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nazarenes</a>, who sought to invest modern painting with the purity of form and spiritual values that they saw in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> and Northern European art. Their inspiration was the art of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8I-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pintoricchio</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Francia</a> and the young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>. The group was named after an early Christian sect made up of Christ’s first followers who came from Nazareth – Jesus’s home town. It was founded by Johann Friedrich Overbeck (1789–1869) and Franz Pforr (1788–1812) and later joined by Peter von Cornelius (1784–1867). The artists were originally called the Brotherhood of Saint Luke (after the patron saint of artists) but came to be known as the Nazarenes because of their religious devotion. In England the Nazarenes were part of the inspiration for the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, formed in 1848, which widely admired Schnorr’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">prints</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture was <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIC-0008-0000-0000.htm">engraved</a> as Plate 85 of Schnorr’s best-known work, the collection of prints known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bilderbibel</span> or ‘Bible in Pictures’.</p></div>
