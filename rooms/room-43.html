        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dancers in Degas’s painting are clouded in a mist of tulle, but two striking heads of red hair seem to anchor the blurred forms moving in space. Arms and legs curve and stretch, delicate white skirts toss and sway. The white tutus depicted here are the practice dress worn by the younger dancers at the Paris Opéra in the late nineteenth century. They are a recurring feature in Degas’s many paintings of graceful and seemingly weightless dancers, whether in the rehearsal salon or on the stage.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas had access to all parts of the theatre at the Opéra, and this painting displays his detailed knowledge of a dancer’s training. These young women are shown in class, in the moments between preparatory exercises at the barre and the real, demanding steps included in a stage performance. The dancer closest to us rests her foot on the bench to adjust the ribbons of her shoe. Even in an ungainly pose she is elegant, displaying her strong, expressive back. Directly behind her, other dancers move from one undefined position to another, although one clearly rises on pointe in arabesque, her leg stretched behind her, her fingers lightly touching the wall to steady herself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The texture of the paint on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP6-0008-0000-0000.htm">canvas</a> seems almost as ephemeral as the dancers‘ costumes – it is delicate, almost cobweb-like, and the canvas support shows through in places. In the late 1880s Degas began to use <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pastel</a> with which he could ’draw with colour‘, and although this picture is painted in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a>, it has the dry, powdery look of pastel and, as with pastel, the colours are subtly layered and blended.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While Degas spent many hours in the theatre and probably made sketches and drawings on the spot, most of his work was done in his studio, where dancers came to pose for him. But he also believed that drawing from memory was essential in the creative process. The scenes, set either in the salon or on stage, and with their distinctive atmospheres, were created using drawings but also through the filter of memory.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist once wrote that ’it is necessary to do a subject ten times, a hundred times. Nothing in art must seem an accident'. Since they were small children, the dancers would have trained daily in the steps and positions that are the vocabulary of classical ballet, performing them over and over again. Even in repose during a class or waiting in the wings during a performance, dancers repeat themselves – they practice a difficult step, adjust their costumes, scratch their backs, slump in a moment of exhaustion and constantly bend and stretch to keep warm.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas repeats these characteristic movements in many of his pictures, perhaps not entirely for aesthetic reasons: repetition is exactly what the dancers do. It also seems connected to his own committed work ethic – he practised his craft tirelessly, making countless drawings and preparatory studies for every painting. It’s as if he recognised an affinity with these ethereal creatures whose life was dedicated to the hard, often grinding, practice and effort of producing any work of art that appears impromptu and effortless.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Cirque Fernando was built in 1875 near the Place Pigalle in Paris, close to where Degas lived. He saw Miss La La perform there several times. Born Anna Albertine Olga Brown (1858-1945), she was a mixed heritage circus performer famous for her feats of strength. Olga is especially known as the inventor of the ‘Iron Jaw’ act, where she holds herself up by clenching a leather mouthpiece between her teeth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the painting, she is seen during one of her famous Iron Jaw performances. She is suspended from the ceiling as she is hoisted up to the roof by a rope. In one of her other acts she even carried a firing cannon, while dangling upside down from a trapeze. Degas places us among the audience, looking up at the spectacle above.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Painting an acrobat allowed Degas to combine his interest in modern life with his fascination for complicated poses. He made several preparatory studies for Miss La La’s portrait, paying particular attention to the complex construction of the roof, which covers most of the canvas. After it was finished, the painting was shown at the Fourth Impressionist Exhibition in Paris in 1879.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Hanging from the ceiling by her teeth, is trapeze artist and aerialist Miss La La. She performed at the Cirque Fernando, which was built in 1875 near the Place Pigalle in Paris, not far from Degas’s studio. Miss La La was born Anna Albertine Olga Brown (1858-1945) to an African-American father and a white mother, in Kupfermühle, Prussia (current Poland). She began performing at age nine and travelled with different companies and acts throughout Europe. From 1879, she began using her stage name Miss La La and became well-known for her famous ‘Iron Jaw’ act. The performance, in which she was lifted to the roof of the circus, hanging by her teeth, gained much admiration for her incredible feats of strength. Together with her circus-partner Theophila Szterker (1864-1888), professionally known as Kaira la Blanche, Miss La La performed as the acrobatic duo ‘Olga and Kaira’, holding up Kaira from a trapeze between her teeth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In his only circus painting, Degas shows Miss La La in the middle of her signature Iron Jaw act. She is depicted while clenching a leather mouthpiece, which was made specifically for her act. The painting shows her hoisted up into the air by a pulley, extending her arms in opposite directions, as if mid-flight. Her purple-coloured leotard is decorated with golden adornments and a white fringe, which contrasts with her brown skin and tights. The upwards view of Miss La La conceals her face and expression, seemingly hiding her identity from the audience.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas made several preparatory studies for the painting, sketching Miss La La in different positions and outfits. His studies show a few adjustments to Miss La La’s pose, experimenting with the placement of her limbs. Still, it was mainly the background with which Degas struggled most. He had trouble finding the correct way to depict the perspective of the high sealing, as well as the architectural lines of the arcades, windows and roof trusses. According to his friend, British artist Walter Sickert, Degas needed the help of an architecturally skilled draftsman to assist him with sketching the ceiling. Miss La La is placed in the upper left corner of the composition, so it is the structure of the roof itself – the paired windows, beams, girders and gild decoration – that mostly fills the painting. Her pose is clearly integrated within the structure: the lines of her arms and lower legs form a parallel with the diagonal lines of the angled green girders, just as her thighs echo the vertical supports.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Miss La La at the Cirque Fernando</span> differs from other 19th-century paintings of circuses. In most works, the composition is focused on either the circus ring or the audience. Degas’s composition, however, is aimed upwards, towards the ceiling of the building. The post-impressionist Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, one of Degas’s contemporaries, made numerous depictions of circuses, in which he almost exclusively focused on the circus ring. His compositions are often seen from above, as if looking down from one of the top seats. To emphasize the performances, Toulouse-Lautrec eliminated the audience in most of his works and left the bleachers empty. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDW-0001-0000-0000.htm">Georges Seurat</a>, another post-impressionist, depicted various circus members in his work Les Cirque (1890-1), including a female performer on a white horse, some tumbling clowns and a neatly coiffed ringmaster.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In painting a highly foreshortened figure suspended in space and seen from below, Degas may have been seeking to emulate the expansive ceiling paintings by Italian Baroque and Rococo artists such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PYG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Battista Tiepolo</a> and Giovanni Battista Piazzetta. Degas would have known these works from his early years in Italy in the 1860’s and visiting again in 1873, a few years before he painted Miss La La. Our view of the skilled trapeze artist directly reproduces a viewpoint often used by Tiepolo, such as in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Allegory with Venus and Time</span> (ca. 1754-8), also found in the National Gallery collection. The upwards view of the goddess Venus and Time, mirrors the angle in which Miss La La is depicted. By ascending her to an orange-green ceilinged heaven, Degas compares Miss La La’s godlike strength to the Venus in Tiepolo’s allegory.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>While Degas sketched seascapes on the coast of Normandy in summer 1869, this unfinished, heavily reworked painting combining elements from those earlier studies probably was executed several years later in the artist’s studio in Paris. Bold in composition and unusual in technique, it reveals Degas’s willingness to experiment.</p><p>The girl’s dark silhouettes cut across the picture surface, their naked bodies assailed by invigorating waves. Clutching hands like a chain of paper dolls, they enter the sea in a jerky yet choreographic movement, facing the setting sun. With its unconventional appearance, shifts in scale and broad treatment the picture counts among Degas’s most progressive works of the mid-1870s. The painting appears in the catalogues of the second (1876) and third (1877) Impressionist Exhibitions in Paris but as no critic in either year comments on what would have been one of the most daring works on view, at the last minute the artist may have chosen not to submit it. It remained with him for the rest of his life.</p></div>

Like many members of Degas’s family they lived in Naples, which Degas himself returned to in the winter of 1873–4, when he accompanied his dying father there. He was in Naples again in 1875 for the funeral of an uncle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This portrait was either painted during one of these visits – being in mourning may explain Elena’s black dress – or when Elena was in Paris. Degas had previously painted Elena with her younger sister, Camilla, around 1865–8. In that portrait, she also looks directly at us.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas originally planned to show Elena facing towards the right, with a more pensive look.

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Elena Carafa was Degas’s first cousin, although some 20 years younger than him. Her mother, Stefanina, the Duchessa Montejasi-Cicerale, was the youngest sister of Degas’s father,  Augustin De Gas. Augustin had been born in Naples, and many members of the Degas family were still living in the city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas had previously painted Elena with her younger sister, Camilla, around 1865–8. In that portrait, Elena also looks out directly at us. Degas returned to Naples in the winter of 1873–4, when he accompanied his dying father there. He was in Naples again in 1875 for the funeral of his uncle, Achille. This portrait of Elena was either painted during one of these visits or when she was visiting Paris. She would have been about 20 at the time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Instead of sitting upright, as in a more formal portrait, Elena leans back into an armchair, its curved outline echoing the shape of her shoulders.  Her torso falls diagonally across the picture and her head, set at a slight tilt, is a little off-centre. Her hands rest on a book or magazine, and she holds open the page she is reading with one finger. Despite the relaxed pose, her expression is more inquisitive than openly welcoming, as she looks up having been interrupted while reading. However, any sense of wariness, or even challenge, towards us is offset by the pose and by the painting’s warm colours, especially the deep pinks of the upholstery and the vermilion reds behind her dark hair. Wrapped in a pale emerald shawl that covers her black dress – she may be in mourning for Achille – Elena has no jewellery or other accessories. This further enhances the informality, even intimacy, of our encounter with her.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pose we see here was not the one originally planned by Degas. Technical examination of the canvas shows that Elena was initially facing towards the right, with a more pensive and distant look. In the finished painting, Degas turned her face towards the centre so that she now looks at us directly. He also increased the volume of Elena’s hair, which is held up by a hairpin indicated by a tiny dab of white paint, and moved her left shoulder to position her upper body more towards us. Although altering the position and expression of the face significantly modified the portrait, the changes were relatively simple to make. If you look closely, you can see some of these alterations – for example, the original line of Elena’s left shoulder is visible underneath the shawl. As is often the case with Degas, he uses varying degrees of finish in the painting. Greatest attention is given to the face and hands but, as our gaze moves away from these, there is a reduction of focus and detail. The background in the upper right area especially is only sketched in very broadly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas was to paint Elena at least one more time when, around 1876, he painted both sisters again, this time with their mother.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gauguin painted this still life soon after he had arrived in Tahiti for his second and final stay in 1895. Exotic red bougainvillea and hibiscus, white and yellow frangipani, white tiare and large blue leaves burst out of a dark clay pot. They look as though they are slightly past their best, and some blossoms have fallen onto the table top. What seems to have interested Gauguin is the pattern of decorative shapes and the delicate interweaving of reds, creams and blues against the gold background rather than the horticultural detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gauguin may have started this extravagant bouquet as a study of an actual floral arrangement but finished it from imagination, as it has the same dream-like quality as his Tahitian figure paintings. In 1899, when the dealer Ambroise Vollard asked Gauguin to send him some flower paintings for sale, the artist replied that he had ‘done only a few’ because  ‘I do not copy nature – today even less than formerly. With me, everything happens in my exuberant imagination.’</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Flower paintings were popular in late nineteenth-century French art, and when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gauguin</a> began to paint floral studies in the 1870s, while he was still an amateur artist, there were several possible sources of inspiration. His earliest still lifes of bunches of flowers in vases recall the compositions of Fantin-Latour and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a>. Later on he came into intimate contact with what are now the most famous nineteenth-century flower paintings of all: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a>’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sunflowers</span>. The Dutchman painted four pictures of sunflowers to decorate Gauguin’s bedroom in the house they shared in Arles for a few months in 1888. One of these, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GE6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sunflowers</a></span>, is in the National Gallery’s collection. Van Gogh’s still lifes evidently made a long-lasting impression of Gauguin, as he painted four of his own still lifes of sunflowers over a decade later, when he was in Tahiti. The seeds may have been sent to him by his friend George-Daniel de Monfried, since Gauguin had written to de Monfried in 1896 asking him to send flower bulbs and seeds suitable for a hot climate: ‘I would like to embellish my little plantation, and as you know, I adore flowers.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The flowers in this picture are exotic blooms that would have flourished in the Polynesian climate. Red bougainvillea and hibiscus, white and yellow frangipani, white tiare and large blue leaves burst out of a dark clay pot. They look as though they are slightly past their best, wilting in the vase, and some blossoms have fallen onto the table top. What seems to have interested Gauguin is the overall pattern of decorative shapes and colours – the delicate interweaving of reds, creams and blues that glow against the golden background – rather than the horticultural detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1899, when the dealer Ambroise Vollard asked Gauguin to send him some flower paintings for sale, the artist replied that he had ‘done only a few’ because ‘I do not copy nature – today even less than formerly. With me, everything  happens in my exuberant imagination. And when I’m tired of painting figures (which I prefer) I start a still life which I finish without a model.…Besides, this is not really a land of flowers’. It is possible that this is what happened with this painting, which was perhaps begun with a study of an actual floral arrangement but ended up as an almost hallucinogenic extravaganza with the same dream-like quality as the Tahitian figure paintings. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PUT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Odilon Redon</a> greatly admired Gauguin’s work, and the floral arrangement in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFY-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ophelia Among the Flowers</a></span> of 1905–8 echoes this painting in its glowing colour and otherworldly quality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Degas bought Gauguin’s painting from de Monfried in 1898. Degas had helped Gauguin organise an exhibition in Paris of his Tahitian paintings four years earlier, and eventually acquired eleven of his paintings for his personal collection.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One of Gauguin’s favourite paintings was Cezanne’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Still Life with Fruit Dish</span>, (1879–80, Museum of Modern Art, New York), which he acquired for his own collection around 1880.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This still life is a homage to that picture, and repeats many of its elements: the fruit, the pottery, the rumpled tablecloth and the angled knife at the lower right. The truncated diagonal brushstrokes and the flattened perspective, in which foreground and distance are collapsed together, are also reminiscent of Cezanne’s work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The narrow strip at the top of the painting – a dense arrangement of buildings – is something of an enigma. The inclusion of a frame suggests that it is a view from a window, but there is no continuity between the clearly defined larger scene and the smaller blurred image next to it. No specific view has yet been identified, and it looks more like a cityscape than rural Brittany, where Gauguin was spending extended periods of time when this was painted.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Around 1880, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gauguin</a> was enjoying some prosperity as a stockbroker in Paris, he bought six paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P84-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cezanne</a>, of which  <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Still Life with Fruit Dish</span> (1879–80, Museum of Modern Art, New York) seems to have been his favourite. He described it as ‘an exceptional pearl, the apple of my eye’. Even when he left most of his collection in Copenhagen in 1883 when he parted from his Danish wife, he took this picture back to Paris with him, and he refused to sell it until he was desperate for money towards the end of his life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gauguin spent extended periods of time in Brittany in the late 1880s and early 1890s in search of a more ‘primitive’, simpler way of life than that offered by Paris, and new sources of inspiration.  When he travelled to Brittany in 1890 he brought along his Cezanne picture, and included it in the background of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Portrait of a Woman</span> (Art Institute of Chicago) painted that year. He probably painted this still life at about the same time as a further homage to Cezanne. It repeats many of the elements in Cezanne’s still life, such as the fruit, the pottery, the rumpled tablecloth and the angled knife at the lower right, which is almost a direct quotation from that picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By the 1880s, Cezanne was emerging as the leading French avant-garde artist, and other aspiring artists needed to show that they understood and had absorbed his work. At the time Gauguin was moving away from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>, with its emphasis on painting techniques that captured transient natural phenomena, and searching for a more structured approach to his work. He may have felt that Cezanne pointed the way towards an art with more rigour. The truncated diagonal brushstrokes and the flattened perspective, in which foreground and distance are collapsed together, certainly seem to be taken from Cezanne. The curiously two-dimensional tankard may be one that was made locally; it looks like the kind of drinking vessel used by the Breton peasants and fishermen among whom Gauguin was living.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The thin strip at the top of the picture – a dense arrangement of roof tops – is something of an enigma. The inclusion of a frame suggests that it is meant to represent a view from a window, but there is none of the continuity between the clearly defined larger scene and the smaller blurred image next to it that one would expect.  Furthermore, the  buildings look more like a cityscape than a small Breton village.  No specific location has yet been identified, however, and this assembly of geometrical shapes may even have been a purely imaginary tribute to Cezanne’s landscapes, which often feature buildings closely packed together.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist’s characteristic signature ‘P Go’, which he began to use around this time, is placed upside down in the lower left corner. There is no obvious reason for this, but perhaps Gauguin intended to make it seem as though it were carved into the table top.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>In 1891 Gauguin travelled to the South Pacific islands, where he stayed for nearly the rest of his life, mostly on the island of Tahiti. The title of this painting is almost certainly a misunderstanding on the artist's part of the Tahitian word 'fa`ai`ei`e' which means "to beautify, adorn, embellish", in the sense of making oneself beautiful for a special occasion.</p> <p>In common with many of his other paintings of the period, for example 'Where Do We Come From? What are We? Where are We Going?' of 1897 (Boston, Museum of Fine Arts), Gauguin has used a horizontal format inspired by Javanese sculptured friezes. Some of the individual figures, such as the central woman, are also taken from such friezes. The three women on the left and the horseman reappear in 'Rupe Rupe (Luxury)' of 1899 (Moscow, Pushkin State Museum of Fine Arts).</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On 25 June 1889, just one month after he admitted himself as a patient at the psychiatric hospital of Saint-Paul de Mausole at St-Rémy in the south of France, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> wrote to his brother Theo: ‘The cypresses still preoccupy me, I’d like to do something with them like the canvases of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GE6-0001-0000-0000.htm">sunflowers</a> because it astonishes me that no one has yet done them as I see them. It’s beautiful as regards lines and proportions like an Egyptian obelisk. And the green has such a distinguished quality. It’s the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">dark</span> patch in a sun-drenched landscape.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh produced several versions of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">A Wheatfield, with Cypresses</span>. Allowed out of the hospital’s grounds if accompanied by a guardian, he painted his first version on site in late June 1889. He viewed that picture (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) as a first impression or preliminary study for the final painting. In September, while temporarily confined to his room due to a relapse, Van Gogh painted the National Gallery’s picture. The same scale as the initial study, this is the final version, which Van Gogh judged to be one of his best summer landscapes. He also made a smaller copy for his mother and sister (now in a private collection).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Devoid of visible human presence, this landscape includes typically Provençal motifs – a golden wheat field, tall evergreen cypresses, an olive bush and a backdrop of the blue Alpilles mountains. This landscape had a special, even symbolic, meaning for Van Gogh. In particular, the cycle from sowing to harvesting wheat – often represented by the figures of the sower and the reaper – was a metaphor, based on biblical parable, for life and death. Writing to his sister on 2 July regarding people’s responses to events we do not control or understand, he observed, ‘What else can one do … but gaze upon the wheatfields. Their story is ours, for we who live on bread, are we not ourselves wheat to a considerable extent, at least ought we not to submit to growing, powerless to move, like a plant, relative to what our imagination sometimes desires, and to be reaped when we are ripe, as it is?’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh wrote of painting outdoors during the summer mistral, the strong, cold wind of southern France. Here we can sense the wind animating not just the wheat and trees but the clouds too, and even the distant mountains, as everything is depicted with powerful rhythmic lines. By painting the landscape again, Van Gogh was able to make this second version slightly more stylised than the first. In this, he was responding to the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Gauguin</a> and Emile Bernard. Noting in his letters that his work was ‘comparable’ in purpose to theirs, their move towards abstraction further encouraged his own break with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh also cited <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monticelli</a>’s use of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a> as an influence, although he has not applied the paint as thickly here as in the first version. His signature swirling brushstrokes nonetheless both energise and bind together every part of the landscape and convey his abiding sense of nature’s vitality. This dynamic sinuous line has similarities with the serpentine line of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Art Nouveau</a>, which was emerging at this time. However, Van Gogh’s line is never merely decorative but is used for expressive ends.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh painted this view from his window at the asylum in Saint-Rémy, following a severe epileptic attack which had prevented him from painting. Typical of his work at this date, the scene is based on direct observation but is laden with personal meaning. The hardworking ploughman, tilling the soil at dawn, becomes a symbol for the artist himself: in October 1889, Van Gogh wrote to his mother, ‘I am ploughing on my canvases as they do in their fields’. The heightened colours and animated, loaded brushwork also demonstrate Van Gogh’s increasing recognition that colour and surface had expressive potential, independent of the objects they described. This painting is one of many Van Gogh completed in the final two years of his life that celebrated the work of manual labourers, set in landscapes awash with vitality and movement.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After suffering a prolonged period of psychological ill health, Van Gogh admitted himself to a psychiatric hospital in the town of Saint-Rémy, Provence, in May 1889. Prohibited from leaving the hospital grounds without a chaperone, Van Gogh took inspiration from the view he could see at his window: a walled-in wheatfield below, a small hut to the side, and the Alpilles mountain range emerging ahead. The vista formed the basis of this painting and eight others, all completed during Van Gogh’s year-long stay at the hospital, which develop the motif of the enclosed field in states of sunshine, harvest, moonlight, and rain.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">Landscape with Ploughman</span> is thought to have been the first work Van Gogh produced after suffering a severe epileptic attack in 1889 which had prevented him from painting. In the August of that year, he wrote a letter to his brother, Theo, saying, ‘yesterday I began to work a little again,’ and included a small sketch of what would become this painting. Typical of Van Gogh’s work at this date, the scene was based on direct observation but laden with personal and aesthetic meaning. The hardworking ploughman, tilling the soil at dawn, becomes a symbol for the artist himself: in October 1889, Van Gogh wrote to his mother, ‘I am ploughing on my canvases as they do in their fields.’ The artist felt deeply about the earth’s natural order – the way its rhythms and cycles are maintained by the harvest – such that the ploughman’s immersion in the landscape comes to represent a celebratory symbiosis between man and nature. That aspects of the painting have an imaginative, perhaps allegorical dimension is also evident in the artistic licence Van Gogh took with the composition: he inserted two trees in the upper left-hand corner and diminished the size of the mountains.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Fields populated by labourers and peasant life more broadly appear throughout Van Gogh’s oeuvre. While some of his earlier paintings engaged with a realist style, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Peat Boat with Two Figures</span> (1883, Drents Museum, Assen) or <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Potato Eaters</span> (1885, Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam), Van Gogh’s output in Saint-Rémy reveals a more expressive quality and a greater intensity of feeling. In this work, elongated brushstrokes applied at crooked, sloping angles give the impression of an animated and undulating land, while concentric marks around the sun sharpen the power of its light. The muddy earth is rendered in a palette of luminous blues, broken up by yellow farming tracks, as two sets of flowers – visible in dabs of red paint in the bottom right-hand corner and golden additions in the centre – suggest a delicacy within the hardy landscape. The heightened colours and loaded brushwork demonstrate Van Gogh’s increasing recognition that colour and surface had expressive potential, independent of the objects they described.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A few weeks after painting this work, Van Gogh made a variant with the same title (Museum of Fine Arts, Boston), in which a serene blue strip, painted in lighter brushstrokes and more muted tones, replaces the earlier version’s blazing sun and tightly cropped sky. By contrast, the density of paint in the National Gallery loan accentuates the surface of the canvas, allowing us to see part relate to whole, as distinctive individual strokes accumulate into an entire landscape.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">From May 1889 to May 1890, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> was a patient at the psychiatric hospital at Saint-Paul de Mausole, near the village of St-Rémy in the south of France. He was initially restricted to working within the hospital’s precincts, although he was pleased to find these included ‘abandoned gardens’ in which ‘the grass grows tall and unkempt, mixed with all kinds of weeds’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Among the works Van Gogh produced while at the hospital were a number of sketches and paintings that look down at small areas of meadow or undergrowth. Although these patches of nature may have been shaped by human intervention – crops have been sown, grass has been cut, or there may be the suggestion of a path – there is no obvious human presence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Writing to his brother Theo around 4 May 1890, Van Gogh stated ‘the work is going well, I’ve done 2 canvases of the newly cut grass.’ He provided a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EX8-0008-0000-0000.htm">sketch</a> of one and the other is presumed to be this painting. The sketch shows a meadow filled with flowers, with two large tree trunks in the left foreground – the view in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Pine Trees and Dandelions in the Garden of the Saint-Paul hospital</span> of 1890 (Kröller-Müller Museum, Oterloo). In the National Gallery painting, however, Van Gogh has focused almost exclusively on the grass and some white butterflies. It is as if this picture is an enlarged detail of one of the grassy areas in the Kröller-Müller painting or a detail from one of the enclosed meadows that Van Gogh also painted while at the hospital, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Field of Wheat Spring at Sunrise</span> (1890), also in the Kröller-Müller Museum.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although there is no horizon or sky, an effect of spatial depth is created by a path near the top of the picture, which runs almost parallel with the upper left edge of the canvas. The bases of several trees or bushes and the smaller size of the blades of grass in the distance, which are perhaps part of a separate meadow that fills the upper third of the picture, add to this depth. In contrast to the boundary formed by the path, the remaining space is open and potentially extends beyond the other three edges of the canvas. Van Gogh has painted the grass itself using tones of green, yellow, ochre and white interspersed with blue, lilac and purple. He painted the grass with distinct brushstrokes of varying length, laid down in clusters like the clumps they describe. In the distance, these strokes become shorter dashes and dots.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh’s interest in depicting nature in detail may have been encouraged by what he had read about Japanese culture. Writing to Theo in September 1888, he explained that the ‘wise Japanese man’ was not interested in astronomy or politics: ‘No, he studies a single blade of grass. But this blade of grass leads him to draw all the plants – then the seasons, the grand spectacles of landscapes, finally animals, then the human figure … isn’t what we are taught by these simple Japanese, who live in nature as they themselves were flowers, almost a true religion?’ Pictorially, however, Van Gogh’s detailed studies of nature, especially of vegetation and flowers, had important precedents in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> art, notably studies by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a>, and in seventeenth-century Dutch painting.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">‘The sunflower is mine’, Van Gogh once declared. Soon after his death he became known as the painter of sunflowers, an identification that endures to this day. No other artist has been so closely associated with a specific flower, and his sunflower pictures continue to be among Van Gogh’s most iconic – and loved – works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is one of five versions of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sunflowers</span> on display in museums and galleries across the world, although <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> painted seven versions in total between 1888 and 1889. Of the seven, one is in a private collection and has not been exhibited for generations. The other, bought by a Japanese collector in 1921, was destroyed during the Second World War. In addition to the National Gallery’s painting, the four other versions on public display are in the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam, the Neue Pinakothek in Munich, the Philadelphia Museum of Art and the Sompo Museum in Tokyo.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The seven pictures were made in two groups: four were painted in August 1888 and three replicas were painted in January 1889, which Van Gogh described as ‘absolutely equal and identical copies’. These copies, along with the original paintings, were to be used as side panels to versions of his portrait of Madame Roulin, the wife of the Arles postman. Van Gogh painted the first four versions of his sunflowers in just one week. He worked quickly before the flowers faded, writing to his brother Theo, ‘I am painting with the gusto of a Marseillaise eating bouillabaisse ... If I carry out this idea there will be a dozen panels. So the whole thing will be a symphony in blue and yellow.’ The first two paintings to be completed were the one now in a private collection and the painting destroyed by bombing. The second two paintings – <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Fourteen Sunflowers</span> (Munich) and the National Gallery’s picture – are the most important of the series. Van Gogh considered both good enough to hang and signed them ‘Vincent’, using his first name only as people found it difficult to pronounce his last name. They were also among the few works he felt confident enough to exhibit in Brussels in November 1889.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh had previously painted sunflower <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still lifes</a>, but was prompted to paint this series by the imminent arrival of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Gauguin</a>, his friend and fellow artist, at the ‘Yellow House’, his rented home in Arles. Van Gogh was anxious to please his guest, who arrived on 23 October, and he knew Gauguin liked his sunflower pictures. As he explained to Theo, ‘I would like to do a decoration for the studio. Nothing but large Sunflowers’ (although he changed his plans and hung two pictures – this one and the Munich painting – in the guest room which Gauguin was to use). Van Gogh hoped that Gauguin’s arrival would be the first step in forming a new ‘association’ of like-minded artists, a ‘Studio in the South’. However, following a fight on 23 December, when Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a knife and then cut off part of his own left ear, Gauguin returned to Paris. Although the friends never saw each other again, they continued to write, and in one letter Gauguin asked Van Gogh to make a sunflower painting for him. While living with Van Gogh, Gauguin painted the portrait <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Van Gogh Painting Sunflowers</span> (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam). The scene was imagined, as the sunflower season was over and Van Gogh did not work on his sunflower pictures at all during the two months Gauguin was in Arles.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gauguin may have admired Van Gogh’s sunflowers – in 1887 he had exchanged one of his Martinique landscapes for two of Van Gogh’s small sunflower studies – and yellow may have been his favourite colour, but the flower also had significance for Van Gogh himself. In this painting the 15 sunflowers are in different stages of their life cycle, from young bud through to maturity and eventual decay and death. The bud in the lower left corner has yet to reach full flower, seven flowers are in full bloom and the other seven have lost their petals and are turning to seed. Van Gogh has brilliantly captured the textures of the flowers in these various stages. Long strokes follow the direction of the petals, leaves and stems, whose sinuous lines echo those of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Art Nouveau</a>; small raised dabs of stippled paint imitate the bristling seed heads. Here, especially, Van Gogh exploited the stiff consistency of the new <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paints</a> introduced in the nineteenth century to create thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a> effects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sunflowers’ life cycle follows the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FI8-0008-0000-0000.htm">vanitas</a></span> tradition of seventeenth-century Dutch flower painting, but the sunflower had also been associated with love, both sacred and profane, since the sixteenth century. This was because just as the sunflower turns to follow the sun, so the true believer follows Christ and the lover follows the object of their affection. This idea could be extended to other instances of devotion, such as the subject who follows a leader or to the notion of art following nature. For Van Gogh, the sunflower’s association with art and love may have included the idea of artistic friendship or partnership, which he hoped to forge with Gauguin. The sunflower may also have had even more personal meanings for him. In February 1890 he wrote to the critic Albert Aurier, suggesting that the two sunflower pictures he was exhibiting in Brussels (the Munich and London versions) might ‘express the idea symbolising "gratitude".’ Symbolism aside, sunflowers were also visually striking examples of the beauty and vitality of nature, with which Van Gogh had always had a strong bond.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The paintings were also important artistic statements, not least because they were among the first paintings Van Gogh produced in Arles that show his signature expressive style. In this painting Van Gogh limited his palette to just one primary colour – ‘a picture all in yellow’ as he described it – although yellow here ranges from rich orange ochre to the pale greenish yellow of the background. Yellow could signify happiness for Van Gogh, and it was also the colour of Provence and a tribute to the Provençal painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQG-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monticelli</a> who ‘depicted the south [of France] all in yellow, all in orange, all in sulphur’. Van Gogh, too, has created a similar effect of incandescent heat, particularly with the circular seed heads, which seem to stand in for the sun itself.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p>This is thought to have been painted soon after Van Gogh's release from hospital in Arles in January 1889. On 7 January he wrote to his brother Theo: 'I am going to set to work again tomorrow. I shall start by doing one or two still lifes to get used to painting again'. He was probably also inspired by a woodcut by Hokusai, 'Crabs', which was reproduced in the May 1888 issue of 'Le Japon Artistique', sent to Vincent by Theo in September of that year. In a related painting in the Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam, the crab is shown lying on its back. Here it is probably the same crab shown both on its back and upright. The artist has used varied brushstrokes to convey texture. Parallel strokes sculpt the creature's form on an exuberant sea-like surface.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting of a simple chair set on a bare floor of  terracotta tiles is one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a>’s most iconic images. Straight-backed and with no armrests, the chair is made of plain unpolished wood painted yellow and has a rush seat. Entirely functional, its construction could not be more basic. Although it appears sturdy, it is also crudely made – the legs, for example, are not quite properly aligned. It recalls the rustic peasant chairs in Van Gogh’s Dutch paintings from the 1880s, and two very similar chairs appear in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Bedroom</span> of 1888 (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam). Van Gogh has placed his pipe and tobacco pouch on the seat. Behind the chair, to the left, is a low box signed ‘Vincent’; it contains some sprouting bulbs, possibly onions. To the right, part of a blue door is visible, its large hinge echoing the line of the chair’s legs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting was a pair to another picture, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Gauguin’s Chair</span> (Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam). Writing to his brother Theo in December 1888, Vincent described the paintings: ‘the last two studies are odd enough. Size 30 canvases, a wooden rush-bottomed chair all yellow on red tiles against a wall [daytime]. Then Gauguin’s armchair, red and green night effect, walls and floors red and green again, on the seat two novels and a candle, on thin canvas with thick impasto.’ As the letter reveals, the two paintings were pendants intended to be hung together, with one chair turned to the right, the other to the left. Van Gogh had begun working on them in November 1888, soon after <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OVH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Paul Gauguin</a> had joined him in Arles, where they lived together in the Yellow House. Indeed, the chairs may have been among the dozen he had bought in September to furnish the house ready for Gauguin’s imminent arrival. Van Gogh had recently read Maurice de Fleury’s article, ‘The House of a Modernist: The Architecture of Tomorrow’ and decorated and furnished the rooms of his own ‘artist’s house’ with a view to them reflecting the character of its residents.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Van Gogh hoped that Gauguin’s presence would be the first step in forming a new artistic ‘association’, a ’studio in the south‘. However, following a fight on 23 December when Van Gogh threatened Gauguin with a knife and then cut off part of his own left ear, Gauguin returned to Paris, never to see his friend again. On returning to the house after a fortnight in hospital, Van Gogh slightly reworked the picture of his own chair. Gauguin’s departure added a poignancy to the two images of empty chairs, but the motif may already have had significance for Van Gogh. He had previously written of weeping at the sight of his father’s vacant chair after he had died in 1885 and had also sent Theo the lyrics of an anonymous popular song, ‘The Little Chairs’, which described an elderly couple sitting by a fireplace looking at the chairs their three dead children once occupied. As he observed to Theo, ‘Empty chairs – there are many, more will come.’ Van Gogh was also very attached to an engraving by the British artist Luke Fildes titled ’The Empty Chair'. Published in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Graphic</span> in 1870 (a copy of which Van Gogh owned), it commemorated the death of the novelist Charles Dickens by showing his deserted study on the day he had died. Fildes had recently been commissioned by Dickens to illustrate his last (and unfinished) novel, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like Fildes’s engraving, neither of Van Gogh’s two chair paintings includes a sitter; instead, he chose specific objects and visual effects to represent the personalities and distinct artistic outlooks of himself and Gauguin. In effect, these are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FB1-0008-0000-0000.htm">still lifes</a> that function as surrogates for portraits. While Van Gogh’s chair is functional and artisanal, Gauguin’s is an elegant and more finely carved armchair. Van Gogh’s chair is shown in the bright daylight of southern France, the natural lighting reinforced by the presence of the sprouting onions, which are also a reminder of the importance of nature for him – a connection emphasised by the name ‘Vincent’ on the box. The pipe and tobacco pouch perhaps represent simple, homely comforts, and he had previously sketched his father’s pipe shortly after his death. Pipe smoking had also been a symbol of transience in seventeenth-century Dutch painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Gauguin’s chair, on the other hand, is shown at night and includes both a lit candle on the chair and, in the upper left corner, a gas light. The candle is a reference to the collaboration between Dickens and Fildes – in the illustration for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Mystery of Edwin Drood</span> titled ‘Sleeping It Off’ a candle on a chair illuminates the gloom of an opium den. This ‘night effect’ with its unnatural lighting may be a comment on Gauguin’s taste for night life, but it also suggests Gauguin’s more mystical conception of artistic creation that drew upon a symbol or an idea, often prompted by literature (represented by the two novels placed on his chair). Colour has an important role in establishing these differences, the yellow and blues of Van Gogh’s chair contrasting with the reds and greens of Gauguin’s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At Arles Van Gogh increasingly used colour for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0008-0000-0000.htm">symbolic</a> effect, and he urged his brother and mutual friends to study colour theory, particularly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Delacroix</a>’s use of colour, noting of his own chair painting: ‘I have tried for an effect of light by means of pure colour.’ Van Gogh’s emphatic use of colour outlines – including red lines to highlight the sunlight on the back of his chair and the blue edging around its yellow legs and below the seat – relate to his experiments with Cloisonnism, a style of painting derived from popular prints and Japanese woodcuts, in which flat areas of colour were bounded by a dark outline. Van Gogh communicated extensively and exchanged paintings with artists associated with Cloisonnism, such as Emile Bernard, as he sought to move away from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a>. Vigorously painted directly from the motif in vibrant colours using thick <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">impasto</a>, Van Gogh’s chair has a physical presence and expressive immediacy that affirmed his artistic breakthrough in Arles.</p></div>

The family cat, Zizi, was drawn many times by the artist, and also appears in watercolour sketches in his letters sent from Bellevue.<br/><br/>This portrait was probably painted after the Manets' return from their summer residence at Rueil, west of Paris. It is considered unfinished, and it is possible that Manet was working on it when he died in 1883. <br/><br/>The vibrant slashes of paint in red, blue and white across the sitter's breast are typical of the artist's sketch technique.<br/><br/>This painting was in the collection of <a href="/artists/hilaire-germain-edgar-degas">Degas</a>, who obtained it from the dealer Ambroise Vollard in exchange for a <a href="/paintings/glossary/pastel">pastel</a>.</p></div>

It is hard to overstate quite how glamorous and influential she was: the local newspapers dubbed her the 'Queen of Paris’.  A talented pianist, she associated with nearly all the most famous artists, writers and musicians in the city and sat for portraits by Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Pierre Bonnard and Edouard Vuillard. Renoir painted her portrait seven or eight times, each of which required three day-long sittings per week for a month. This is one of the best known. It is dated 1904, the year she turned 32 and divorced her first husband. Renoir has captured her shimmering glamour and poise but also perhaps something of her emotional turmoil – she seems to be looking directly at the viewer yet not quite focusing on us.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sitter in this portrait is Misia Sert, née Godebska, who was the darling of the highest artistic circles in France at the turn of the twentieth century. It is hard to overstate quite how glamorous and influential a figure she was. At a time when the city was the art capital of the world, the local newspapers dubbed her the ‘Queen of Paris’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The granddaughter of a famous Belgian cellist and daughter of a Polish sculptor, Misia (a diminutive of Maria) was an accomplished pianist in her own right and was always surrounded by creative people. The composer and pianist Franz Liszt was a friend of the family and as a teenager she took piano lessons from Gabriel Fauré, also an extremely influential composer. She decided against a professional career, but often played at private soirees, once accompanying Enrico Caruso, the most famous singer of the day.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1893, aged 21, Misia married Thadée Natanson, who was from a wealthy banking family and was a director of the influential literary and artistic review, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Revue blanche</span>. The couple moved from Belgium to Paris, where Misia’s charm and beauty intrigued some of the greatest artists, writers and musicians in the city. She sat for Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec (who portrayed her playing the piano), Pierre Bonnard and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q1E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Edouard Vuillard</a> as well as Renoir. The novelist Marcel Proust used her as a prototype for two characters in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Á la recherche du temps perdu</span> (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">In Search of Lost Time</span>’) and the poet Mallarmé wrote poems in her honour. Maurice Ravel composed at least two pieces for her, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Le Cygne</span> (‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Swan</span>’), and it was to her that Éric Satie dedicated the piano music for the avant-garde ballet <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Parade</span>. She was instrumental in persuading Diaghilev, founder of the Ballets Russes, to stage the production, which was written by Jean Cocteau, with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Picasso</a> designing the set.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to Misia’s memoirs, Renoir painted her portrait seven or eight times, each of which required three day-long sittings per week for a month. This is one of the best known. It is dated 1904, when she turned 32 – this was also the year in which she divorced her first husband. She married the wealthy Anglo-French newspaper baron Alfred Edwards the following year.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Renoir has captured the shimmering glamour and poise of Misia as she leans against the bolster of her chaise longue, the society hostess at home and at ease. However, there is a strange tension in her posture. The lower half of her body seems sinuous and relaxed, and she cradles the head of her sleeping dog affectionately against her thigh. But there is also an awkwardness to the pose. It is not clear how her legs are supported – they seem too far forward from the front edge of the chaise longue. The upper half of her body leans slightly stiffly to one side, although she holds her head upright and alert. Her gaze is also hard to interpret – she seems to be looking directly at the viewer yet not quite focusing. Perhaps Renoir had captured something of her emotional uncertainty in the face of her divorce.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Her marriage to Edwards failed and in 1920, after an 11-year affair, she married the Spanish painter José-Maria Sert. Coco Chanel, the fashion designer, was one of her closest friends and joined them on their honeymoon in Venice. When Misia died in 1950, the portrait was still in her possession.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jan Toorop was a Dutch-Indonesian artist, born to a Dutch father and Chinese-Indonesian mother. After travelling to the Netherlands as a young boy, he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in 1883, where he met many influential artists such as James Ensor and Théo van Rysselberghe.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Toorop joined the Brussels-based Les XX group in 1885 and participated in many of their annual exhibitions. He was greatly influenced by his fellow members of Les XX, adopting a more colourful, Neo-Impressionist palette. Taking inspiration from the pointillists in the group, Toorop became one of the most important pointillist painters in the Netherlands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This work is a prime example of Toorop’s paintings of rural fishing communities in the south of the Netherlands. He was especially interested in the ‘simplicity’ of their daily lives. Toorop portrayed the fishermen at work on the coast, weaving an emphatic social criticism throughout his paintings. He painted many of the fishermen and women seating in the dunes, hauling in their boats, or mending their nets.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A fisherman battles through the waves at high tide, hauling his fishing boat ashore. With the sea swirling around his thighs, he strains forward, pulling a thick rope. The boat is not visible, we see only the fisherman’s effort. Dragging boats to shore was a recurring evening practice in small Dutch coastal fishing villages. The flat bottoms of the fishing boats made it easier for the fishermen to pull them onto the beach at high tide, as shown in this picture. While living in the seaside town of Katwijk aan Zee, Toorop must have witnessed the ritual on a daily basis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Toorop was a Dutch-Indonesian artist, born to a Dutch father and a Chinese-Indonesian mother, on the formerly colonised island of Java. After a failed attempt to study at the University of Delft, Toorop enrolled at the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Amsterdam, where he studied under Dutch artist August Allebé from 1880 to 1882. The following year, he enrolled at the École des Beaux-Arts in Brussels, where he met many influential artists including James Ensor and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QVZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Théo van Rysselberghe</a>. He became an active member of Brussels avant-garde circles and visited both Paris and London.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1883, Belgian lawyer and art critic Octave Maus founded the anti-academic Les XX group consisting of 20 Belgian artists. The group organised yearly exhibitions between 1884 and 1893 to counteract the more conservative Salon exhibitions. Toorop joined Les XX in 1885 as the only Dutchman among its four foreign members – the others being the French artists Auguste Rodin and Paul Signac and the Greek Périclès Pantazis. His involvement with Les XX inspired Toorop to work in a more colourful, Neo-Impressionist palette. As a result of his collaboration with the pointillists Paul Signac and Théo van Rhysselberghe, Toorop became one of the most important pointillist painters in the Netherlands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">After travelling widely throughout Europe, Toorop moved to Katwijk aan Zee with his English wife Annie Hall in 1890. He knew the area well, having lived there already in 1887. Like the French artists Jean-François Millet and Jules Breton before him, Toorop was interested in the ‘simplicity’ of daily life in the rural villages. He painted the fishermen carrying out their heavy work on the coast, expressing a certain emphatic social criticism he had been exploring in recent years – a notion often found in Neo-Impressionist artworks. He portrayed many of the Katwijk fishermen and women seated in the dunes, hauling their boats, or mending their nets, displaying their hardship as a key element to his paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The yellow colour and thick impasto of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">High Tide</span> are reminiscent of a work by one of Toorop’s contemporaries: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GE6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Sunflowers</a> (1888) by the Dutch artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Vincent van Gogh</a>, who tragically died the year before. Toorop knew Van Gogh’s works well, as they both exhibited with Les XX in 1890 and (Van Gogh posthumously) in 1891. The yellow colours of the foaming waves in Toorop’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">High Tide</span> are strikingly similar to the yellows in Van Gogh’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Sunflowers</span>, which he exhibited in the 1890 show. The rough application of paint and swift brushstrokes in <span class="dokuwiki_italic">High Tide</span> reveal Toorop’s admiration for Van Gogh. After the latter’s death, Toorop was the first to organise a solo exhibition dedicated to the artist at the Kunstkring in The Hague in 1892. In collaboration with Johanna van Gogh-Bonger – widow of Vincent’s brother Theo and custodian of Vincent’s oeuvre – Toorop selected 45 paintings and 44 drawings. At the time of the exhibition, Van Gogh was still relatively unknown in his native the Netherlands and his avant-garde style was seen as rather controversial. As a result, Toorop’s efforts marked the first significant introduction of Van Gogh’s works to the Dutch public.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Toorop painted in his colourful Neo-Impressionist manner for several years, working mainly in the southern Dutch provinces of Zuid-Holland and Zeeland during the late 1890’s and early 1900’s. He gradually moved into a more <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6J-0008-0000-0000.htm">symbolist</a> approach, taking inspiration from the Brussels <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Art Nouveau</a> style. However, Toorop never fully committed to a single style until halfway through his career. He easily moved between different styles, alternating between Neo-Impressionism and Symbolism. Ultimately, he decided on his characteristic symbolist Art Nouveau style. Toorop designed many lithographs using the decorative linework typical of the Art Nouveau, including his famous poster for Delft Salad Oil (1894). The design became immensely popular in the Netherlands, securing Toorop’s position as one of the leading Dutch Symbolists and contributing to Art Nouveau’s Dutch moniker as ‘Salad Oil Style’.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A young woman is seated in a garden. Although her upper body is turned slightly towards us, her face is in profile, and she does not engage with us. Her clothing is restrained, and her plain white blouse is fully buttoned up to her neck. Her expression, too, is subdued, as if she is preoccupied and her thoughts are elsewhere.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec made a number of half-length <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFY-0008-0000-0000.htm">plein air</a> portraits of female friends, shop assistants and prostitutes. This half-length portrait was exhibited during his lifetime with the title <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Woman Seated in a Garden</span>. The sitter is thought to be a dancer and model who we know only as Gabrielle. She appears in several other pictures by Toulouse-Lautrec. Amongst others, in a work in the Oskar Reinhart Collection, Winterthur, she is portrayed on the arm of Cha-U-Kao, an entertainer who performed at the Moulin Rouge and the Nouveau Cirque in the 1890s. In another (Musée Toulouse-Lautrec, Albi) she is alone. The garden, which Toulouse-Lautrec used for other portraits, was probably that of the retired photographer, Père Forest, who was Toulouse-Lautrec’s neighbour in Montmartre, an area in northern Paris known for its nightlife and bohemian locals.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Toulouse-Lautrec arrived in Paris to train as an artist in 1882, the year of the Seventh Impressionist exhibition. Although he worked mainly as a graphic artist and printmaker, and is perhaps best known for his posters advertising venues such as the Moulin Rouge, this <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> painting on millboard shows the influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionism</a> upon his work. This is particularly evident in the loose brushwork of the clothing and the foliage. Like the Impressionists, Toulouse-Lautrec is alert here to the play of light and to the way surfaces reflect light and colour from their environment. For example, the green tinge around Gabrielle’s throat and chin, together with the streaks of dark green in her jacket, echo the foliage behind her. The blue outline around her face gives definition to her profile and echoes the touches of blue in her clothing and background, integrating Gabrielle with her surroundings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although painted, this is almost a drawing in paint. Toulouse-Lautrec has made great use of outline, especially around Gabrielle, and for the trees and foliage. Outlined shapes have been filled in using a variety of brushstrokes, which range from short strokes (visible in the face) to long thin ribbons of paint (which can be seen in the jacket). The picture has little perspectival depth or volume. Instead, the use of line and the overall effect of decorative flatness show clear affinities not only with the posters Toulouse-Lautrec created in the 1890s but also with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Art Nouveau</a>, which was at its height at this time.</p></div>
