        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Between late August or early September 1890 and February 1891, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> painted a group of twenty-five compositions of grainstacks. Conceived as a decorative ensemble rather than individual pictures, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Stacks of Wheat</span> are the first of his “series” paintings – a practice that would mark a breakthrough in his career.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet found this motif in a field near his studio in Giverny. Over the course of the seasons, he depicted this rural landscape repeatedly, experimenting with different viewpoints, compositions and light conditions. Here, a monumental grain stack dominates the left side of the canvas. Set against a hilly backdrop, with a few houses scattered in the distance, it is bathed by the warm light of the setting sun.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Through a stunning array of hot oranges, pinks, purples and light blues, Monet revels in rendering the atmospheric effects surrounding the objects – what he called the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">enveloppe</span>, “the same light diffused over everything”. “To me, the motif itself is an insignificant factor”, he wrote, “What I want to reproduce is what exists between the motif and me”. Yet, the stacks of wheat bore a specific meaning to late 19th century viewers:  a source of income for the farmers, who carefully arranged the wheat in these characteristic conical shapes, they were a key feature of the French countryside, symbolising prosperity and the fertility of the land.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet likely begun working on the canvas <span class="dokuwiki_italic">en plein air</span> on a winter day, then finished it over multiple sessions in his studio. Some <span class="dokuwiki_italic">pentimenti</span> – changes to the composition – as well as the crusty paint, thickly applied in heavy layers, testify to the artist’s relentless experimentation. At some point, Monet modified the stack’s position, making its top coincide with the line of hills in the background. The geometrical quality of this arrangement, which sets it apart from most pictures of the series, was praised by the critic Camille Mauclair, who saw in it “a surety of execution that is almost mathematical”.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In May 1891, Monet exhibited for the first time fifteen Stacks of Wheat at Durand-Ruel’s in Paris. Prefacing the exhibition catalogue, Gustave Geffroy considered the series a “victorious artistic demonstration” conveying “the sensation of the ephemeral instant that comes into existence and never again returns”. Unanimously acclaimed, the show will mark a pivotal moment in Monet’s career, establishing his fame as one of the most successful artists of the day.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">By the late nineteenth century hybridisation had created almost 200 different varieties of iris. The flowers had originated in Japan and featured in the Japanese prints Monet so admired –  we know that he owned a print of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Irises</span> by the Japanese artist Hokusai. He would also have been familiar with the paintings of irises that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Van Gogh</a> made in the year before his death in 1890. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> cultivated many different varieties of iris, and in 1913 his head gardener even published an  article in a horticultural magazine detailing the different types that grew in the garden, including one that was named ‘Mme Claude Monet’, after Monet’s wife.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Irises were planted beneath the trees in the ‘Clos Normand’ flower garden in front of Monet’s house and around the banks and along the paths of the lily pond in his water garden. Clumps of them can be seen bordering the pond in an earlier view of the water garden, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CLG-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Water-lily pond</a></span>. The irises made an impressive sight. Georges Truffaut, a great horticultural expert who visited Giverny, wrote: ‘The edges of the pond are thickly covered with irises of every kind. In the spring there are <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Iris sibirica</span> and Virginian irises with their long petals and velvety texture; later on the Japanese irises and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Kaempferi</span> irises grow here in quantity.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is one of approximately 20 views of  irises in the water garden that Monet painted around 1914–17. One striking characteristic of these canvases is the experimentation with unusual and unexpected viewpoints.  It looks as though the bird’s-eye view here is painted from a vantage point on the Japanese bridge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Most of the iris pictures of this date are exactly two metres high, the same height as<span class="dokuwiki_italic"> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Water-Lilies</a></span>, the large panel also in the National Gallery’s collection. The pictures were painted in the large studio Monet had built at Giverny in order to work on huge canvases of his water garden. The National Gallery’s iris painting was rapidly executed, with the garden path laid in first and the flower border worked over its edges. The most fluid section is the swirling blues and greens in the lower right corner. Like <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Water-Lilies</span>, it is painted on a luminous white ground, which is left uncovered in places, particularly in the lower right corner and along the lower edge, and the brushwork is very loose and open at the right edge of the picture. Monet applied thick purples, blues and greens using bold, even crude strokes. The effects may have been partly the result of the double cataracts which were altering his vision by this date.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is not clear whether Monet regarded the picture as finished since it remained in his studio (along with <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Water-Lilies</span>) at his death.  It is possible that the large pictures of irises were intended as studies, and that Monet may at one point have been thinking of including irises in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grandes Dėcorations</span> series of paintings of the water-lily pond. The final series, which he donated to the French state, and which is now on show in the Musėe de l’Orangerie in Paris, does not include irises, but a photograph taken in 1920 of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grandes Dėcorations</span>  in progress suggests that Monet may have considered featuring them in the scheme.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p>Although dated 1890, this work was actually painted the following year. In the spring of 1891 Monet began work on a series of 23 paintings depicting the poplars which lined the left bank of the river Epte, near Limetz, south of Giverny. On 18 June the town decided to auction off the trees. Monet persuaded a wood merchant to buy them jointly with him, on the condition that they were left standing for a few more months to enable the artist to finish his series.<br/><br/> The works were painted from a flat-bottomed boat which Monet borrowed from fellow artist Gustave Caillebotte. From this low vantage-point the trees are viewed silhouetted against the sky and their formal qualities are stressed.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1893 Monet bought a plot of land next to his house in Giverny. He had already planted a colourful flower garden, but now he wanted to create a water garden ‘both for the pleasure of the eye and for the purpose of having subjects to paint'. He enlarged the existing pond, filling it with exotic new hybrid water lilies, and built a humpback bridge at one end, inspired by examples seen in Japanese prints. The water garden became the main obsession of Monet’s later career, and the subject of some 250 paintings.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, the bridge spans the width of the canvas but is cut off at the edges so that it seems to float unanchored above the water, its shape reflected in a dark arc at the bottom of the picture. The perspective seems to shift; it is as though we are looking up at the bridge but down on the water lilies which float towards the distance. The vertical reflections of the trees provide a counterpoint to the horizontal clumps of the lily pads.</p></div>
      </div>
      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">For <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>, gardens offered a refuge from the modern urban and industrial world, although he and his fellow garden enthusiasts benefited from modern advances in botanical science that were creating new hybrid flowers in a wide choice of shapes and colours that could be produced on an almost industrial scale. He made modest gardens in the homes he rented in Argenteuil and Vetheuil in the 1870s, but from 1883, when he moved to a rented house in Giverny, about 50 miles to the west of Paris, he had more scope to indulge his passion for plants. He became a dedicated gardener with an extensive botanical knowledge, and sought the opinions of leading horticulturalists. As Monet’s career flourished his increasing wealth enabled him to fund what became a grand horticultural enterprise: by the 1890s he was employing as many as eight gardeners.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet began by refashioning the garden in front of the house, the so-called ‘Clos Normand’, replacing the existing kitchen garden and orchard with densely planted colourful flower beds that were filled with blooms throughout the seasons. He was able to buy the house in 1890, and three years later he purchased an adjacent plot of land next to the river Epte beyond the railway line at the edge of his property. The plot had a small pond with arrowhead and wild water lilies, which he wanted to turn into a water garden with a larger lily pond ‘both for the pleasure of the eye and for the purpose of having subjects to paint’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The idea may have occurred to him after he had seen the water garden at the 1899 Exposition Universelle in Paris created by the grower Joseph Bory Latour-Marliac, who bred the first colourful hardy waterlilies. Monet began by requesting permission from the Prefect of the Eure to dig irrigation channels from the Ru – a branch of the Epte – to feed his pond, but the Giverny villagers objected, fearing it would contaminate the water and that the foreign plants would poison their cattle. Monet was furious, but three months later permission came through and he began to enlarge the existing pond, replacing the wild water lilies with Latour-Marliac hybrids available in yellows, pinks, whites and violets.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pond was enlarged on further occasions – in 1901 and 1904 – tripling the size of the water garden. Together with the flower garden on the other side of the railway track it became the principal preoccupation of the last 26 years of Monet’s life. While the Clos Normand garden was laid out along fairly traditional lines, harking back to the formal French gardens of seventeenth-century Europe, with a central alleyway and geometrically arranged beds, the water garden was more Eastern in inspiration. Its less regimented, more natural design and more muted colours created a quieter, meditative atmosphere. Monet erected a Japanese bridge over the western end of the pond that took its inspiration from the bridges in ukiyo-e Japanese prints. He was a keen collector of these prints and he owned a copy of Hiroshige’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Wisteria at Kameido Tenjin Shrine</span> (1856), one of the many prints that features a curved bridge. In a more general sense, the water garden reflected Monet’s admiration for the Japanese appreciation of nature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet had to wait for his water garden to mature before he could begin to paint it in earnest. As he later recalled: ‘It took me some time to understand my water-lilies. It takes more than a day to get under your skin. And then all at once, I had the revelation – how wonderful my pond was – and reached for my palette. I’ve hardly had any other subject since that moment.’ In total, Monet painted 250 canvases of his water garden.  Around 200 of these represent water lilies floating on the surface of the water, while the remainder also show the Japanese bridge, the weeping willow trees and wisteria and the irises, agapanthus and day lilies on its banks. In all these pictures Monet was painting a subject that was already ‘pictorial’ – a landscape that had been carefully composed according to his personal aesthetic. The National Gallery has three further paintings of the water garden :<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0J57-0001-0000-0000.htm">Water-lilies, setting sun</a></span>; <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CL3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Irises</a></span>; and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Water-lilies</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet painted three views of the Japanese bridge in 1895, not long after it had been constructed, but then took a break from the subject, only returning to it in 1899. By now the pool was overhung by vegetation and surrounded by plants, but to judge from contemporary photographs it was never as enclosed as Monet painted it, and he exaggerated the feeling of claustrophobia. In December 1900 he exhibited 12 paintings at Durand-Ruel’s gallery in Paris, all of which showed more or less symmetrical views of the Japanese bridge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting, as in the others in the series, we are looking down onto the surface of the water, where the lily pads float into the distance, meeting the dense foliage on the far bank. Weeping willows are reflected in the pond and clumps of iris border its banks. The perspective seems to shift so that it is hard to find a single focal point; it is as though we are looking up at the bridge but down on the waterlilies. The picture, like the water itself, seems to oscillate between surface and depth. The mainly vertical reflections provide a counterpoint to the horizontal clumps of the lily pads. Different colours, applied with thick brushstrokes, are placed next to each other. This way of painting has more in common with Monet’s early <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F06-0008-0000-0000.htm">Impressionist</a> works than his more recent paintings of mornings on the Seine, where he had used softer, more blended strokes to convey hazy atmospheric effects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Japanese bridge series marked a turning point in Monet’s art. From now on his subjects were painted from an increasingly confined  viewpoint, conveying the sense of an enclosed world. In later paintings of the pond, he would dispense with the banks and bridge altogether to focus solely on the water, the reflections and the water lilies. The culmination of Monet’s water lily paintings were the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Grandes Dėcorations</span>, 22 enormous canvases each over two metres high and totalling more than 90 metres in length, which he completed months before his death and donated to the French state. These are now on permanent display in two oval rooms in the Musée de l’Orangerie, Paris.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1883 Monet rented a house in Giverny, to the west of Paris. In 1890 he was able to buy the house, and in 1893 additional land which he transformed into water gardens.  Towards the end of the 1890s Monet started to paint these.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1883 Monet rented a house in Giverny, to the west of Paris. In 1890 he was able to buy the house, and in 1893 additional land which he gradually transformed into water gardens.  While these gardens took form, throughout the 1890s Monet focussed on series paintings, including views of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CQG-0001-0000-0000.htm">poplars bordering the river Epte,</a>  and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0BZQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">depictions of grainstacks</a> under different light effects. His last series, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mornings on the Seine</span>, was exhibited at the Galerie Georges Petit in 1898.  It was around this time that Monet turned attention to his gardens as subjects for painting. At first he concentrated on such motifs as the Japanese bridge, as in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CLG-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Water-Lily Pond</a></span>, but later moved towards more immersive treatments of the water itself, exploring the play between flowers punctuating its surface and reflections of the unseen sky and trees.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Following a series of personal tragedies, between June 1912 and August 1914 Monet hardly worked at all, but after the outbreak of the First World War in 1914 he returned to painting, believing it his patriotic duty to produce pictures.  These included a planned series of large-scale decorations featuring the water-lily pond, to accommodate which he had a new studio built in 1915-6. The day after Armistice on 11 November 1918, he pledged to present a group of these to the French State as a monument to peace. In 1927 twenty-two works were installed in the Orangerie, Paris. Other large-scale decorations, including <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CRV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Water-Lilies</a></span>, remained at Giverny until after the Second World War.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet painted his decorations during the winter in his new studio, often working on several canvases at once. During the summer he painted outdoors on smaller canvases such as this. Here he is looking over the pond’s surface at an angle. At the bottom left a strip of bank is marked by a diagonal line of bright green paint; at top right a row of trees is evoked in dark green. The same green is used for the water, on the surface of which float oval lily pads, rendered schematically in shades of blue and purple. The decorative effect is heightened by circular brushwork used to create their ethereal forms, intensified by reinforcing of outlines with lighter or darker paint. Their abstract patterning is interrupted by three creamy-yellow water-lilies, tangible shapes which stand proud of the flat surface of water and leaves.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1916 Monet  had a new studio built at his home in Giverny in order to work on huge canvases of his water-lily pond, each of them more than two metres high. These monumental paintings were intended to form an entire decorative scheme, and he donated 22 of them to the French state after the First World War. They are now housed in two oval rooms in the Musėe de l’Orangerie in Paris. The rest of the large-scale water-lily canvases, of which this is one, remained in Giverny until after the Second World War.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Orangerie canvases tend to have recognisable details of trees and foliage which act as compositional anchors and help locate the viewer in the scene. However, this painting lacks any of these; distance and perspective are abolished and a limitless expanse of water occupies our entire field of vision. The huge pale picture offers an immersive experience, its surface alive and shimmering with trails of green, ochre, violet, yellow, sky blue and pink.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the years before he painted this canvas <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a>  experienced some tragic events that had led to a relatively fallow period in his artistic output.  His wife Alice died in 1911 and his son Jean in 1914, not long after he himself was diagnosed with cataracts that affected his vision. But in the summer of 1914, on the brink of the First World War, he began to paint again, refusing to join the ranks of people fleeing from Paris and Giverny. Apparently feeling it was his patriotic duty to continue working, he concentrated on his water garden – a subject that was to preoccupy him until his death 12 years later.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It seems that Monet had long had it in mind to paint an entire decorative scheme consisting of a continuous panorama of water and flowers in a circular room, but he did not begin to put his plan into practice until 1916, when he had a new studio built at his home in Giverny in order to work on the huge canvases, each of them more than two metres high. These monumental paintings, which show close-up views of the water, have long sweeps of canvas dominated by a single colour.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet worked concurrently on many of them for several years. From an early stage he envisaged presenting them to the French nation, and he was encouraged in this by his friend Georges Clemenceau, who was Prime Minister of France from 1917 to 1920. In 1918, the day after the Armistice was signed, the painter promised a group of the paintings to the French nation as a particularly personal war memorial that honoured victory and peace and offered an immersive experience that enabled the viewer to forget the outside world. He originally intended 12 canvases to be hung in the Hôtel Biron in Paris, which the French government planned  to open as the Musėe Rodin, but later agreed that they would be housed at the Orangerie. Twenty-two of his water-lily canvases were installed there in 1927, the year after his death, in two specially designed oval rooms. The rest of the large-scale water-lily canvases, of which this is one, remained in Giverny until after the Second World War.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The canvases on show in the Orangerie tend to have recognisable details of trees and foliage which act as compositional anchors and help locate the viewer in the scene. However, this painting lacks any of these; distance and perspective are abolished and a limitless expanse of water occupies our entire field of vision. The water lily pads seem to play a secondary role, floating outwards towards the edges, leaving a space in the centre. It is not clear whether this shows the reflections of willows, sky or cloud. The huge pale picture surface is alive and shimmering with trails of green, ochre, violet, yellow, sky blue and pink.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When the painting went on display at the National Gallery in 1963, one commentator noted ‘It is a great area of drifting, nebulous colour with which it is very difficult to establish any consistent relationship. The only proper reaction would be to dive into it and drown.’</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">During the final two decades of his life <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Monet</a> devoted himself to painting the water garden he had created at his home in Giverny, producing around 250 innovative canvases. Around 200 of these represent just the water-lilies floating on the surface of the water, while the remainder show the Japanese bridge at the northern edge of the pond, the weeping willow trees, wisteria, irises, agapanthus and day lilies on its banks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">From 1902 to 1908 Monet concentrated on an extended series of views of the water-lily pond that marked a radical departure in his work. He gradually did away with the banks of the pond and the traditional horizon line and abandoned the depiction of the Japanese bridge and trees (which can be seen in earlier paintings such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CLG-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Water-Lily Pond</a></span>) in order to concentrate on the subtle modulations of light as it transformed the water and the reflections of foliage and clouds. The exercise was challenging and at times frustrating, and Monet even destroyed some of the canvases because he was dissatisfied with them. But in May 1909 he exhibited 48 paintings at Durand-Ruel’s gallery in Paris with the title ‘Water lilies: Series of Water Landscapes.’ The critical response was overwhelmingly positive, and by the end of the year 19 of the pictures had been sold. One commentator wrote that ‘Monet has reached the final degree of abstraction and imagination allied to the real that his art of the landscapist allows.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In this painting we are looking down on the surface of the pond. We see reflections in the water, but not the sky and trees that are being reflected. The only hint to help situate us is the clump of plants in the bottom left corner, which indicates the approximate position of the bank. These plants may have been added after the main body of the painting was completed in about 1907, as a photograph taken in Monet’s studio at around that date shows the picture without them. The leaves are sketched in with quickly applied, almost calligraphic brushstrokes that recall Japanese brush painting. Pink and yellow light from the setting sun shimmers on the still surface of the water in which the water lilies float. Monet conveys the flatness of the water surface while at the same time indicating its depth. There is an intriguing interplay between the horizontal lily pads and the dark vertical  reflections of the weeping willows.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another person who saw the exhibition at Durand-Ruel’s was Marcel Proust, who was starting his monumental 12-part novel <span class="dokuwiki_italic">In Search of Lost Time</span> (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">A la Recherche du Temps Perdu</span>). His description of the waterlilies on the river Vivonne in the first volume, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Swann’s Way</span>, is based on Monet’s pictures: ‘…the heavy shade of the trees gave the water a background which was ordinarily dark green, although sometimes, when we were coming home on a calm evening after a stormy afternoon, I have seen in its depths a clear, crude blue that was almost violet, suggesting a floor of Japanese cloisonné. Here and there, on the surface, floated, blushing like a strawberry, the scarlet heart of a lily set in a ring of white petals.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Monet kept this painting in his studio until 1923, when he may have reworked it.</p></div>
