        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin Mary has collapsed with grief after learning that Christ, her son, has accepted his inevitable death as the will of God and is making to leave for Jerusalem. The episode is not recorded in the Bible, but it appears in a fourteenth-century German devotional text as well as in Passion plays, specifically one performed in the town of Augsburg. The Augsburg play included a series of exchanges between Christ and his mother, with Christ reassuring her that he must accept his fate as she makes emotional pleas for him to avoid it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Altdorfer’s fascination with nature reflected a growing trend for depicting the natural world in detail and abundance, leading eventually to the emergence of landscape painting as an independent subject, rather than just a background. This panel is dominated by an enormous tree depicted in a wild and unruly state. Beyond the arch, a great swirling cloud glows red in the evening light – an allusion to the blood Christ shed at the Crucifixion.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, who had accepted his inevitable death as the will of God, comforting his mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. Her grief is so intense that she has collapsed to the ground, where she is supported by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>. The women’s draperies are painted with such fluidity that they have the quality of rippling waves, mirroring the women’s anxiety and anguish. The Virgin’s white veil is the most disturbed of all the fabrics, drawing attention to her grim expression. Christ, however, serenely blesses his mother with his right hand. To the right of the scene is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a>, equally calm, his expression compassionate as he gazes at the women. Next to Saint John is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a>, shown as an elderly man, raising his hand in agitation, or perhaps farewell as the apostles separate.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The episode is not recorded in the Bible, but it is found in two fourteenth-century devotional texts: one Italian (Pseudo-Bonaventura’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Meditations on the Life of Christ</span>) and the other German (Brother Phillipp the Carthusian’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Marienleben</span>, which dates to about 1330). Both reflect a type of spirituality which emerged in the fourteenth century, encouraged by figures like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis of Assisi</a>, which emphasised empathy with Christ’s suffering. Intimate stories of personal grief, like that of Christ taking leave of his mother, were appropriately relatable.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Marienleben</span>, this episode was followed by Christ’s entry into Jerusalem. Riding on a donkey to emphasise his humility, Christ approached the city knowing that he would be arrested and killed. The event was reenacted on Palm Sunday in churches across Europe, but in Regensburg, where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P2T-0001-0000-0000.htm">Altdorfer</a> lived, the wooden sculpture of Christ riding a donkey was preceded by two scholars (who were, at this time, always men) dressed as the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Evangelist. Their role was to read lamentations beneath a reconstruction of Christ’s Crucifix.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Altdorfer may have been inspired by these liturgical rituals as well as the even more theatrical Passion plays (dramatic recreations of Christ’s trial and death at the Crucifixion). We know that in the town of Augsburg, the Passion play featured emotional exchanges between Christ, Mary and her companions: as the women lament and plead with Christ to evade death, he responds that he ‘must fulfil the Scriptures and also my father’s will’ by dying. He blesses his mother, as in Altdorfer’s painting, and instructs Peter and John the Evangelist to prepare for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FS8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Last Supper</a>. Altdorfer probably had both the Passion play and the Palm Sunday procession in mind when making this work. Indeed, Christ’s dress and appearance resemble those of the sculpted Christs used in the processions – only his hands and feet are visible beneath a long simple tunic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Altdorfer’s fascination with nature reflected a growing trend in painting for depicting the natural world in detail and abundance, leading eventually to the emergence of landscape painting as an independent subject, rather than just a background. This panel is dominated by an enormous tree, depicted in a wild and unruly state. The rocky foreground is painted in great detail – each stone is defined, with some cast in shadow by the women’s figures. The women themselves are grouped beneath an abandoned archway overgrown with foliage; it is as if the forest is taking over. On the rounded column topped by the spiked cone is a scene of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Flagellation</a>, a foretaste of Christ’s torture before his death: his fate is so inescapable that it is carved in stone. Beyond the arch, a great swirling cloud glows red in the evening light – an allusion to the blood Christ shed at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The group of comparatively minute kneeling figures at the bottom right corner are most likely members of the family that commissioned the painting, but they are, as yet, unidentified.</p></div>

The identity of the artist has not yet been discovered but other works have been connected with this one, and the painter is sometimes known simply as the Master of the London Throne of Mercy.</p></div>

The large fur collar of his coat, the jewel on his cap and the two gold chains around his neck show off his wealth. The longer chain bears two badges: the Virgin and Child within a crescent moon and surrounded by rays, and a bird of prey and a fish facing each other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While the badge of the Virgin and Child is not worn here with one of a swan (as it is in a portrait of a lady by an anonymous German artist that is now in the Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum, Madrid), it is recognisable as the emblem of the Order of Our Lady of the Swan, a religious group that only admitted members of the nobility. Founded in the 1440s by the Elector Frederick II of Brandenburg, the Order was at the height of its popularity in the late fifteenth century, when this portrait was made. The other emblem is the insignia of the elite Society to the Falcon and Fish, a group that organised jousting tournaments for the noblemen based in the southern German region of Swabia.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The white semicircles to the bottom right are part of the sleeve of the man’s shirt; the portrait was cut down at the bottom at some point before it entered the National Gallery’s collection. When it was bought by the Gallery it included the monogram used as a signature by the celebrated German painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Albrecht Dürer</a>, in whose studio Baldung Grien may have worked. When this was discovered to be fake it was removed. The date inscribed above the sitter’s head was, however, confirmed by technical analysis to be original.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The designs of the badges are drawn in black over a gold background. Their two-dimensionality contrasts with the illusionism of the rest of the portrait, for example where Baldung Grien has applied white highlights to the strands of the man’s long hair to convey its sheen or painted the natural whorls in the fur collar.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cupid, the god of erotic love, is complaining to his mother, Venus, the goddess of love: he has been stung by bees after stealing a honeycomb. Venus directs her attention towards the viewer instead. Her narrowed gaze appears flirtatious and she clutches the branch of an apple tree, evocative of the biblical temptress Eve.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a morality tale, based on a Greek poem from the third century BC – though Venus wears a velvet hat and jewelled choker in the style of those worn at the Saxon court where Cranach worked from 1505. The poem describes how life’s pleasures are mixed with pain, as the inscription at the top of the painting observes. Venus explains to her son that the wounds of love he inflicts with his arrows are far worse than any physical pain he may be experiencing.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cupid</a>, the god of erotic love, is complaining to his mother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, the goddess of love: he has been stung by bees while stealing a honeycomb from their hive. Venus has little sympathy for her son’s plight. When he asks her how something so small can inflict so much pain, she points out that the suffering Cupid causes by firing his arrows of love is worse and lasts far longer than a bee sting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The subject is based on a poem, ‘Idyll 19‘ (<span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Honeycomb Stealer</span>), by the Ancient Greek writer Theocritus. Two Latin translations by German scholars, dating from 1522 and 1528, are known. This moralising poem was popular in the humanist circles in which <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cranach</a> moved, and lines from it appear in Latin in the sky at the top of the picture. This inscription translates as: ’Young Cupid was stealing honey from a hive when a bee stung the thief on the finger. So it is for us: the brief and fleeting pleasure we seek/ is mingled with sadness and brings us pain.’</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Venus stands in the centre of the composition, nude apart from the gold jewelled choker and chain around her neck and the wide-brimmed red velvet hat with ostrich feathers on her head. A gold hairnet can be glimpsed underneath the hat. Her jewellery and hat reflect the fashion of the Saxon court where Cranach worked; he routinely dressed female figures from biblical history or classical mythology in contemporary accessories. Cupid stands next to Venus clutching the honeycomb he has just stolen. Bees buzz around his face, and more emerge from the hole in the tree – presumably, this is where he found the comb in the first place. His hand is raised towards his forehead and he looks distressed as he whines to his mother.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Venus’ body is turned at a subtle three-quarter angle, her left leg bent at the knee as she steps over a tree branch. She reaches up to grab a branch from the apple tree behind her – evocative of the Old Testament temptress, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eve</a>. With her right hand, she reaches out towards Cupid. Her stretched pose opens her upper body towards the viewer and emphasises the long limbs and the curves of her silhouette. Her pale skin is illuminated against the dark background of the forest backdrop and her smooth porcelain complexion contrasts with the rough bark of the tree. Her flirtatious gaze is directed towards the viewer. Cranach often depicted his female nudes with this expression; the theme of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">weibermacht</span> (the power of women over men) was popular in Germany in the sixteenth century. Cranach’s erotic portrayal of the goddess is both a warning about the pains of love and a temptation in itself.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The density of the forest behind Venus and Cupid contrasts with the open expanse of water in the distance. A stag and hind hide in the thick vegetation, a detail which would have appealed to Cranach’s princely patrons, as hunting was a popular pastime among the elite. On the other side of the lake, a rocky crag crowned with a castle rises from an outcrop of land. Cranach has paid close attention to detail: we can see the delicate reflections of the houses and swans in the water, and two tiny figures walking down the steep hill. The vivid blue of the sky lightens and fades into warm peach and yellow hues, suggesting that the sun has just set. The water mirrors these colours, obscuring the line of the horizon and giving the location a sense of other-worldliness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was painted around 1525 when Cranach produced a series of important, high-quality commissions. The artist’s insignia can be seen on a rock face by Venus’ raised foot. Cranach adopted this signature, a winged serpent with a crown on its head and a ring in its mouth, after being granted his own coat of arms by Elector Friedrich the Wise in 1508.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don‘t know the identity of this woman dressed in sumptuous fabrics and heavy gold jewellery, but her clothing is like that worn by the elite of society and ladies of the Saxon court. Her outfit is, in parts, physically impossible: the rings she wears under her gloves are higher up her fingers than the ones she wears over them. Cranach has manipulated reality to emphasise her wealth and beauty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The letter ’M' is fashioned in pearls across her bodice, suggesting that this is a portrait of a real person, but her facial features follow a generic, idealised perception of beauty. It has been suggested that this woman could have been a mistress of one of the electors of Saxony, and her features were deliberately generalised by Cranach.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cranach</a> only painted a handful of portraits showing women of the Saxon court during his time as court painter to the electors of Saxony, and this is one of them. The black background contrasts with the woman’s pale complexion, and her red dress draws out the pink blush on her cheeks.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dressed in the fashion of the sixteenth-century German elite, she wears a red velvet dress and a wealth of jewellery, including heavy gold chokers around her neck, pearls and gold thread on her headdress and an abundance of rings on her fingers. This part of her outfit is physically impossible: the rings under her gloves, just visible through the slashes, are higher up her fingers than the ones over them. Cranach has manipulated reality to emphasise her wealth and beauty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The letter ‘M’ is embroidered across the woman’s bodice, likely alluding to her name, although she is yet to be identified. Her facial features lack individual characterisation and instead display an idealised beauty, which is emphasised by her low-cut bodice and the high collar that draws attention to the subtle bulge of her breasts. The woman’s body is positioned at a three-quarter turn, but her gaze is directed towards the viewer. The women in Cranach’s portraits of identifiable people generally avert their gaze, keeping their heads in line with their bodies. This woman stares at us with a look of superiority. Cranach often adopted this expression in his portrayal of classical goddesses, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a>, or biblical temptresses, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eve</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cranach painted a number of portraits in a similar style to this picture around the year 1525. In this group of pictures, individual female figures wear red velvet dresses and jewellery in the contemporary German style, with their bodies turned at a three-quarter angle and their gaze directed towards the viewer. Although the identities of some of these women are unknown, some are thought to represent women from biblical history, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>. Depictions of cunning, sensuous nude women were produced frequently in Cranach’s workshop, and the theme of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">weibermacht</span> (the power of women over men) was particularly popular in Germany in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting makes up the right panel of a portrait diptych (a painting made of two parts) that depicts two future electors of Saxony, Johann the Steadfast and his son, Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Johann Friedrich was six years old when this portrait was made. Against convention, he was portrayed higher up and closer to the viewer than his father, making him appear larger. He faces the viewer straight on, instead of at a quarter-turn to the frame, as was common in many of Cranach’s portraits (and is demonstrated in the left panel of this diptych).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cranach painted Johann Friedrich’s portrait throughout his life, although his depictions of the Elector as a thickly set man with receding dark hair bear little resemblance to the angelic blonde child in this portrait.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Johann Friedrich the Magnanimous was Elector of Saxony from 1532 until 1547. In this portrait he is a six-year-old child, but <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8X-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cranach</a> has depicted him higher up and closer to the viewer than his father appears in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0COK-0001-0000-0000.htm">accompanying portrait</a>. He is positioned close to the edge of the frame, dominating most of the composition.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The portrait presents Johann Friedrich as the ruler he will become, rather than the child he is. His elaborate clothes emphasise his status: set against a black background, he wears a vibrant tartan coat, a heavy gold chain and an elaborate hat adorned with gold brooches and a plume of ostrich feathers. He clutches the hilt of his sword with both hands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cranach continued to paint Johann Friedrich throughout his life, and these portraits show how the angelic blonde boy in this picture grew into a portly man with receding short dark hair and a curly moustache. He was committed to the Protestant cause and a dedicated follower of the teachings of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Martin Luther</a>. His support of Luther led to an escalation of tensions with the Holy Roman Empire and, at the Battle of Mühlberg against Catholic <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TWK-0001-0000-0000.htm">Charles V</a> in 1547, Johann Friedrich was defeated and sent into exile. He was wounded during the battle, and portraits Cranach made after it emphasise the scar that ran from his eye socket down his cheek.</p></div>

The woman reclining on the grass appears unaware of – or unconcerned by – the fighting behind her, as if Cranach is implying that violence is a common occurrence. The two standing men are separated from the rest of the figures by their darker skin tones and long beards; their weather-beaten appearance and unkempt facial hair could suggest they are the most wild of all the figures. The two other men, lying on the ground with their arms raised defensively, are in positions of vulnerability.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Since the twentieth century it has been assumed that the origin of the subject lies in a classical source, and there are a number of texts that Cranach could have used as inspiration. The Ancient Greek author <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Hesiod</a> wrote about the evolutionary ages of man – the Golden Age, Silver Age, Bronze Age and Iron Age – and described the people of the Silver Age as weak and uncaring (hence why the painting has been given this title). Cranach most likely knew Hesiod’s work through an adaption of the text by a contemporary German humanist writer. In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Metamorphoses</span>, Roman poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EM7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ovid</a> sets out the deterioration of man from the Golden Age, and describes forest dwellers who live away from the rest of society during the Bronze Age and Iron Age. Despite the similarities with these two texts, Cranach was likely drawing on a number of literary and visual sources, as well as contemporary ideas about and perceptions of earlier civilisations.</p></div>

She was an early Christian virgin martyr, born in the third century. Her father intended her to be a pagan priestess, and surrounded her with gold statues of pagan idols – she destroyed them after being visited by an angel who told her to embrace Christianity. When her father discovered her conversion to Christianity, he had Christina tortured: she was grilled by fire, tortured on a wheel and shot by arrows. God thwarted all of these attempts to harm her, but she was eventually beheaded. Cranach depicts her standing on the stone to which she was tied before being thrown in a river (she miraculously floated).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Ottilia was born into a noble family, but her father discarded her for being a blind girl; she was taken away and raised by peasants. When she was taken to a monastery aged 12 and baptised into the Christian faith, her eyesight was restored. On discovering this, her brother brought her back to the family home, so enraging their father that he accidentally killed the boy. Ottilia miraculously revived him and then left the family once again. When her father later fell ill, she returned to him and nursed him. She is the patron saint of good eyesight and the region of Alsace. Cranach depicts her in the black robes of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictine</a> abbess; she was abbess of the convent of Hohenburg and also founded a number of monasteries.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Genevieve, born in the fifth century, is the patron saint of Paris. She was a nun, and helped protect the city from attack from the Huns and the Franks. Here, she holds the candle that miraculously relit after the devil blew it out while she was praying alone one night.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Apollonia was a virgin martyr who lived in the second century. She was tortured during an uprising in Alexandria: her teeth were pulled out and she was told she would be burnt to death unless she renounced her Christian faith. She refused, and threw herself into the flames. Considered the patron saint of dentists and dental problems, she is often depicted with the pair of pliers used to extract her teeth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was originally part of a multi-panelled altarpiece (‘The Saint Catherine Altarpiece’ in Dresden) made by Cranach in 1506, shortly after he was appointed court painter to the Elector of Saxony, Friedrich the Wise.</p></div>

It has since been separated from the front of the shutter and detached from the altarpiece’s central panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Genevieve became a nun at fifteen. She is the patron saint of Paris because it is believed her prayers diverted Attila the Hun away from the city and towards Orléans, where he was defeated. Later, when Paris was besieged by Childeric I, she acted as an intermediary between residents and besiegers, helping to collect food and convincing Childeric to release his prisoners. Here, she holds the candle that miraculously relit after being blown out by the devil while she was praying one night. The pendant around her neck displays the first and last letters of the Greek alphabet, alpha and omega, to symbolise Christ. On her gold bodice are the letters ‘GSE’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Apollonia lived in Alexandria, around AD 200. She was one of a group of virgin <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrs</a> who were brutally tortured for their Christian faith. During her torture, Apollonia’s teeth were pulled out with pliers before she was burned to death. The pliers she holds clasp a bloody tooth, and an image of the pliers is also depicted upon the pendant on her necklace.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece was very likely made for the chapel of the electors at Wittenberg castle. The martyrdom of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Catherine</a> is depicted on its central panel, with Electors Friedrich the Wise and, possibly, Johann the Steadfast included as witnesses.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin Mary breastfeeds the infant Christ in a walled garden surrounded by flowers. God the Father, a small figure radiating light, appears in the sky above. The image of the Virgin and Christ Child in a garden was derived from the poetic imagery of the Song of Solomon, a book of the Old Testament. In it, a woman is described as a lily and a rose as well as an enclosed garden (which, when associated with Mary, came to symbolise her virginity).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was probably made by members of Dürer’s workshop. It includes flowers that are derived from his detailed watercolour studies of the natural world – one of his particular artistic preoccupations – many of which would have been available in the workshop. Each floral element had theological significance: the iris and the rose were associated with the Virgin’s ‘Seven Sorrows’, while the grapevine with large leaves and delicate tendrils was a symbol of the Eucharist (when Christians drink wine at Mass in remembrance of Christ).</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> breastfeeds the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> in a walled garden surrounded by vegetation and spring flowers. An arch in the wall reveals the sea beyond, while God the Father – a small figure radiating light – appears in the sky above.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The image of the Virgin and Christ Child in a garden was derived from the imagery of the Old Testament book, the Song of Solomon.  It is a collection of love poems in which a woman describes herself as ‘the rose of Sharon, and the lily of the valleys’ (Song of Solomon 2:1), as well as an enclosed garden, often referred to by the Latin term <span class="dokuwiki_italic">hortus conclusus</span>. The woman in the text was associated with Mary, and the enclosed garden was seen as a metaphor of her perpetual virginity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The image was extremely popular in the Middle Ages and maintained its popularity in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a>’s lifetime. He made several prints and drawings of the Virgin and Child in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">hortus conclusus</span>, a theme he began to develop in studies in around 1503. The garden setting suited the contemporary enthusiasm in Germany in particular for the close study of nature. Each floral element in this painting also has theological significance. The iris was associated with the Virgin’s ‘Seven Sorrows’ – resembling a sword, it was linked with the metaphorical sword that the priest Simeon told Mary would pierce her soul (Luke 2: 35). The grapevine with large leaves and delicate tendrils was a symbol of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a> (when Christians drink wine at <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRM-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mass</a> in remembrance of Christ).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dürer’s many detailed watercolour studies of flowers, vegetation, landscapes and animals reflect his idea that, as he wrote, ‘The more exactly one equals nature, the better the picture looks’. The iris is virtually identical to a watercolour study now in the Kunsthalle Bremen, while the peonies to the right relate very closely to a study of the flower made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schongauer</a>, which Dürer almost certainly owned. One of Dürer’s most famous studies of a humble patch of turf (Albertina, Vienna) seems to have inspired the vegetation on the left of the grassy bench around the Virgin’s mantle, and the bugle and the lily of the valley (neither of which are in flower) resemble a drawing by the workshop (British Museum, London). All of these would have been available in Dürer’s workshop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although the work is not by Dürer’s own hand, the reuse of many of these studies suggests that the picture was produced in his workshop, possibly while he was in Venice in 1505–7. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> reveals the drawing beneath the paint surface and has shown that several artists were involved, though we cannot identify specific individuals. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a> of the Virgin and Christ Child is careful and precise, suggesting they were copied from an existing design. A rose was drawn to the right of the Virgin’s head but was not included in the final image, while the grasses and plants at the left do not appear in the underdrawing they were added during the painting process. The iris was freely drawn but altered in the final painting. These discrepancies suggest the work was composed in sequential phases by different painters. The butterfly perching on the Virgin’s mantle and her white veil were added on top of the painting’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FR1-0008-0000-0000.htm">varnish</a> layer.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This woman’s large white headdress, its calligraphic shape made up of stiff angular folds, is striking against the dark background. The bold visual effect of this almost sculptural item of clothing belies the care the artist has taken to describe the details of its construction. The border covering the woman’s forehead is made up of a series of parallel folds, or tucks, giving this area a ribbed texture; the edges are stitched and it is held in place at her hairline with pins, the indentations of which are visible. Shading around the folds reinforces the sense of their depth. The artist seems to want us to think that a fly, deceived by his illusion, has attempted to land on the headdress. The insect is, of course, also part of the deception and perhaps intended to reinforce the artist’s mastery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The wall-hanging in the background is also not as simple as it first appears. It is perhaps intended to resemble a woven silk, its pattern of foliage and flowers made up of fibres of a subtly different shade of blue to the rest of it. As the white headdress curls over the woman’s shoulder, it differentiates her dress from the hanging, which is made of a similar fabric. Her understated and elegant costume, with its white fur trim and gold fastenings, dates to about 1470.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">With slim fingers she gestures towards a sprig of forget-me-nots. The flowers were sometimes a symbol of marriage, so she may have been portrayed to commemorate an engagement, but they also refer to remembrance. Perhaps they are an invitation to remember the sitter through this portrait when absent, or even after her death. As flies could spread disease and were sometimes seen as a symbol of sinfulness, its presence might be intended to ward against evil and illness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The inscription at the top of the painting reads: GEBORNE HOFERIN. This means that the woman is from the Hofer family, but as this was a common surname in southern Germany at the time it doesn't help to identify her.</p></div>

There was a church in Cologne belonging to the Order and dedicated to Saints John and Cordula; given the patrons’ membership of the Order, it may have been made for one of the altars of this church. The six saints and two donors depicted on the outer faces would have been visible when the shutters were closed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The vibrant colours of the saints’ robes are characteristic of fifteenth-century painting in Cologne. Lochner chose a selection of varied but complementary colours, and has united the figures through his use of them: John’s red-lined mantle echoes the shadows of Catherine’s robe, which is lined with a green that reflects the deepest shade of Matthew’s drapery. The three-dimensionality of the figures is defined by the openings and fold of their draperies and they stand out like sculptural reliefs against the gilded background, which is decorated with a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> ‘pomegranate’ pattern often found on textiles at the time. The pattern was created by carving small grooves in the chalk <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTE-0008-0000-0000.htm">ground</a> before placing gold leaf over the top. The indentations add texture to the image, particularly when lit by candlelight.</p></div>

In the same hand he holds two unwieldy keys – those to the kingdom of heaven, promised to him by Christ. Saint Dorothy holds only a tiny delicate flower to her breast, presumably plucked from the basket of blooms in her left hand. The flowers are a reference to a miracle told in her legend: at Dorothy’s martyrdom, Christ delivered a basket of flowers from heaven to an unbelieving onlooker.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has taken great care to imitate a range of textures faithfully, giving the impression that the saints really are standing before us. The highly polished marble column behind contrasts with the texture of the decorative textile hanging.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel may have formed part of the left-hand shutter of an altarpiece.  At a later date the reverse was painted with one half of a scene of the Adoration of the Kings (which continues on the back of the right-hand shutter).</p></div>

They mirror each other in pose and gesture, and both appear ready to step off the ledge towards us, lending a sense of momentum to their figures.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Peter clutches ​a Bible with a soft leather cover to his chest. In the same hand he holds two unwieldy keys – those to the kingdom of heaven, promised to him by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. In the spindly fingers of his left hand he gingerly clasps a pair of glasses to help him to read. The minute reflection of a latticed window pane is visible in the lenses. Dorothy holds only a tiny delicate flower to her breast, plucked presumably from the basket of blooms in her left hand. The flowers are a reference to a miracle told in her legend which describes how, at her martyrdom, Christ came to deliver a basket of flowers from heaven to an unbelieving onlooker.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has taken great care to imitate a range of textures faithfully, giving the impression that the saints really are standing before us. The highly polished marble column behind contrasts with the texture of the decorative textile hanging, its gold thread catching the light in its folds. The plants in the foreground are painted in great detail, while the hills and trees in the background have a hazy quality that emphasises their distance.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> may have formed part of the left-hand shutter of an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a>. It is a pair to another panel now in the Mainz State Museum which shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJ3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saints Andrew</a> and Columba standing against an almost identical backdrop of a fabric hanging and marble column in front of a landscape. The Mainz panel would have been the right-hand shutter. The central panel has not yet been traced. Both shutter panels have been painted on the reverse with a scene of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adoration of the Kings</a>, added some time after the fronts were completed.</p></div>
