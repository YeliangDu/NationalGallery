        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin and Child are surrounded by saints, each occupying a separate arched compartment bounded by spiral columns. The design is highly unusual and is not known in any other Italian paintings of the period. Its shape and layout have a very specific function: they map the Florentine Church of Santa Maria Novella, the city’s main church belonging to the Dominicans, the order of friars founded by Saint Dominic.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Each saint represents a chapel dedicated to them at the eastern end of the church. This explains why only three of the evangelists are shown, with the animals that became their symbols: Saint Mark with the lion, Saint Luke with the ox and Saint John with the eagle. Saint Matthew is missing because the church didn't have a chapel dedicated to him. It also explains the inclusion of three Dominican saints wearing the Order’s black cloaks. The sequence of saints in the panel mirrors that of the chapels on either side of the central altar, which was dedicated to the Virgin Mary.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The design of this work is unique among surviving Italian panel paintings.  The Virgin Mary holding the Christ Child occupies the central arch, crowned by a triangular gable decorated with carved leaf-like sprays, called crockets.  She is flanked on either side by five half-length images of saints, each contained within arches framed by spiral colonnades. Each tiny spandrel – that is, the space between the arches – is studded with a glass bead, intended to represent a gemstone. The saints can be identified by the objects they hold and by their clothing, but the artist has also included inscriptions with the names below each figure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three of the four evangelists appear: Mark with his symbol, the lion, whose muzzle and whiskers are painted in fine detail; Luke with the ox, to the left of the Virgin; and Saint John immediately to her right, with the eagle. Curiously, Saint Matthew is missing. Three saints, wearing the black cloaks of the Dominicans – a religious order of preaching friars – appear in a row to the Virgin’s left. They include the thirteenth-century saint, Thomas Aquinas, who is shown illuminating a church building with rays of light emanating from the palm of his hand. This refers to his spiritual illumination of the Catholic Church through his teaching and writings. Saint Peter Martyr to his left is shown holding a palm denoting his martyrdom, his wounds still bleeding. Closest to the Virgin is Saint Dominic himself, holding a lily.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two saints to the right of the Virgin are shown wearing gilded brocades, similar to that of the Christ Child. Their effect is created by covering coloured paint with gold leaf and the scratching the gold away, in a technique called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffitto</span>. The female saint is Saint Catherine of Alexandria, a princess killed for her faith after enduring torture at the wheel, which she holds by her side. Saint Thomas à Becket, who was Archbishop of Canterbury, occupies the far right arch. He wears an elaborate cope, mitre and bishop’s crosier. Executed in 1170 by King Henry II, by the Middle Ages his shrine at Canterbury was one of the most famous in Europe. Between them is Saint Mary Magdalene, dressed in red and opening the jar of ointment with which she anointed Christ’s feet (Luke 7:36) and his body after his death (Mark 16:1).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Recent research has revealed that the apparently eccentric selection and sequence of saints reflects the layout of the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella. Every saint depicted here had a chapel dedicated to them at the eastern end of the church in the fourteenth century. It was the main Dominican church in Florence, which explains the inclusion of the three Dominican saints. Santa Maria Novella was Andrea di Bonaiuto’s local parish church where, in 1365-8, he painted a series of frescoes for the walls of the so-called ‘Spanish Chapel’. The order of the saints in the panel mirrors the position of the chapels either side of the central altar, dedicated to the Virgin Mary; those on the left show the sequence of chapels on the church’s north-eastern side and those to her right, that of the south-eastern side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The function of the painting remains unknown: could it have been ordered by a Dominican friar, once connected to the convent of Santa Maria Novella who had moved away, or was it intended as a visual plan of the church for visiting worshippers?</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ, hovering on wispy clouds, is surrounded by angels who sing, dance and play musical instruments. He is shown triumphant over death: his red and white flag was associated with his resurrection; the wound in his right hand, caused when he was crucified, is a reminder of his physical suffering. The artist has incised the gold leaf around him with radiating lines to show that he gives out a golden light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the central panel of the predella (lowest part) of an altarpiece made by Fra Angelico, a painter and friar, for his own convent church of San Domenico in Fiesole, a town just outside Florence. The main part of the altarpiece is still in Fiesole but the predella is now in the National Gallery. It is unusual: it shows Christ in glory surrounded by saints and angels, rather than narrative scenes of the lives of the saints.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the central panel of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I1V-0001-0000-0000.htm">the altarpiece made by Fra Angelico</a> for his own convent church in Fiesole, just outside Florence. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> hovers in the centre of this heavenly scene – you can see traces of white clouds beneath his bare feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is Christ after his death: there is a hole in his right hand, a wound from his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>. His body is paler than his white robe, draped over his shoulder, perhaps to show the pallor of death or that he is shining white. He holds the fluttering flag of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a> – its red cross echoing that on his halo – and makes a blessing gesture. The gold background around him is incised with a series of straight lines that appear to radiate from his body, as though he is glowing with golden light. The angels surrounding him are kept at bay by this powerful light, which is like a golden orb around him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He is surrounded on either side by five rows of angels, some praying, others playing musical instruments. Some appear to sing too.  <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Angelico</a>’s nickname referred to the ‘angelic’ style of his painting which was was graceful, refined and decorative. The panel is immensely detailed: look, for example, at the decorative gilding of the angels’ costumes, some dotted, some patterned; each individual halo has been punched with a small circular shape giving texture to the gold leaf. The angels‘ long blue and gold wings are patterned like peacock feathers.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Orderly rows of angels surround Christ, affirming him as the king of heaven. The upper row of angels to Christ’s left are dressed in red and so are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRW-0008-0000-0000.htm">seraphim</a> and those on the right, in blue, are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE4-0008-0000-0000.htm">cherubim</a>. The angels on the lowest row stand and kneel on a blue semi-circle, perhaps intended to represent the vault of heaven. Immediately below Christ are six angels playing trumpets and two kneeling play hand-held organs. Two angels on the lowest row on the left look like they’re dancing along to the angelic music – it’s a playful detail, enhancing the sense that heaven is joyful after Christ’s resurrection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Certain angelic beings stand out. To Christ’s immediate left an angel approaches to crown him with a wreath of foliage, possibly intended to be a vibrant contrast to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EKD-0008-0000-0000.htm">crown of thorns</a> placed upon his head before his crucifixion. Another – at the front of the third row, on the right  – wears blue and gold armour, and carries a sword and shield. He is the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Archangel Michael</a>, a warrior angel who plays an important role in the weighing of souls at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETD-0008-0000-0000.htm">Last Judgement</a>. The entire predella has been compared with a fresco of the Last Judgement in the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella (the main church of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a>). That scene also shows the Dominican saints lined up in rows; Saint Michael’s prominence here – because of his connection with the Last Judgement – might be a deliberate reference to that church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that Fra Angelico was largely responsible for this scene and had less assistance from his workshop than in the other predella scenes.</p></div>

The Blessed were holy figures belonging to the Order (founded by Saint Dominic in 1215) who were venerated locally after death. Some, like Vincent Ferrer – here holding a book and a large flame – were eventually recognised as saints. Ferrer founded a convent in Fiesole; the altarpiece that this panel comes from was made for it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Each figure carries a different object: we see a skull, a bird and a vase of lilies, the symbol of Saint Dominic. One, clearly killed with a saw that is shown embedded in his head, holds a palm, symbolic of martyrdom. This panel framed the predella (the lowest part) of the altarpiece, which showed Christ surrounded by angels and saints.

We know this because the grain of the wood they are painted on is vertical, like that of the pilasters. This panel was on the left pilaster, and so on the right hand of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> on the central predella panel: this was the most honourable position.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel follows the pattern of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I1V-0001-0000-0000.htm">predella panels</a> by arranging the figures in three rows, with the women kneeling on the bottom row.

The Blessed were recognised as having lived exceptionally holy lives and were venerated locally; some would eventually become saints. For now, though, they do not have haloes like saints. Instead, golden rays shine around their heads.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist has painted the male Blessed as individuals: some are young; some have tanned skin; others are older with white hair. They all have tonsures – partially shaven heads, a sign of piety – and wear the black and white habit of the Dominican Order. Small, neat writing on their tunics tells us who they are (a ‘b’ for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Beatus</span>, followed by their name) but they also carry objects that help identity them. At the far left, an older man carries a skull and a book; his tunic is inscribed ‘b.iodan’, and he might be Blessed Jordan of Pisa. Next to him is Blessed Vincent Ferrer, carrying a book and a flame, who was canonised (made a saint) in 1455. In the top row Blessed Jacob scratches the name of Christ onto his chest in blood. Some of the Blessed were martyred for their faith and so are shown holding palms, a symbol of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The nun who fronts the bottom row, raising her hand towards the central image of Christ, is labelled as ‘b.magaita’, or Margarita. She may be Margaret of Hungary, who bore the stigmata (the wounds of Christ) on her hands, a sign of her holiness. Here, we can see they give out golden rays of light.</p></div>

This is because the panel included not only nuns and monks who had taken vows and lived within the Dominican community, away from the non-religious world, but also tertiaries (on the front row). Tertiaries made a promise to the Dominican Order but had fewer responsibilities and could live outside the convent. Their habits (or uniform) are slightly different.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The men in this panel are mostly elderly with white hair. They all have tonsures – partially shaved heads, a sign of devotion – and wear the black and white habit of the Dominicans. Neat inscriptions on their tunics – a ‘b’ for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Beatus</span> followed by their name – identify them, but they also carry objects that tell us who they are. One, in the centre of the middle row, carries a miniature church on the palm of his hand.

The heart is inscribed with Jesus’s name in gold lettering. The Blessed Peter on the second right in the top row has the same letters inscribed in gold in his mouth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike the panel opposite there is a sense of movement in this picture, partly due the gestures the tertiaries on the bottom row make. Catherine of Siena, who was canonised (made a saint) in 1461, is at the front, her name inscribed along her raised arm. The two tertiaries behind, like her, raise their hands towards the central scene of Christ resurrected. Behind them are the only two figures in the panel without rays around their heads, dressed in the habit of male Dominican tertiaries. They might be Jacopo and Domenico degli Agli, the sons of Barnaba degli Agli, who paid for the altarpiece.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel comes from the predella (the lowest part) of an altarpiece made for the church of San Domenico, Fiesole, near Florence. Its figures look towards the central panel, which shows Christ resurrected from the dead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lined up in neat rows are – from top to bottom – 21 biblical figures regarded by the Christian Church as precursors of Christ, male martyr saints and female martyr saints. The top row includes only one New Testament figure: Saint John the Baptist, holding a cross and wearing a camel skin tunic. He looks directly at us and points towards Christ; in the Gospel of John he announced Christ’s ministry and significance as the son of God.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The male martyrs include Saint Stephen, heading up the middle row. He wears green and has a stone on his shoulder, a reference to his stoning. Below him, in red, is Saint Thecla, the first female martyr.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was originally placed to the right of another, which shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CQH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ after his resurrection</a> – and its figures look towards him. Both panels are from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I1V-0001-0000-0000.htm">the altarpiece of San Domenico</a>, in Fiesole, near Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The top row shows 21 of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s biblical predecessors, those interpreted by the Christian Church as foretelling or prefiguring him. The middle row consists solely of male saints who were martyred for their faith; the bottom row, female martyr saints. They carry palms, the symbol of martyrdom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of the figures in the top row carry scrolls that identify them, such as the prophet Jeremiah, in red, whose scroll is inscribed: YEREMIA. Next to him is Ezekiel, in a blue cap inscribed above the brim in tiny black script: EZECIEL. The row is headed up by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">Adam</a>, depicted, as was common, as an old man with a flowing grey beard; Christ was often described as the ‘new Adam’ for renewing humanity’s relationship with God. Saint John the Baptist is the only <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F22-0008-0000-0000.htm">New Testament</a> figure in this row. He stands at the centre, looking directly out to us. He holds a cross in his left hand and with his right he points towards Christ, echoing his role in the Gospels as the one who foretold Christ’s divinity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The male martyrs in the middle row are identified either by inscriptions or by the objects they hold. So, for example, the second and third in the row are the bishop saint Cyprian and Saint Clement, a first-century pope. Their names are inscribed on their headgear – a mitre and papal tiara respectively. Behind them, two saints are shown with the instruments of their torture. Saint Vincent rests his hand on a large flat grey stone – this is the millstone that drowned him. Next to him <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENC-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Lawrence</a> is shown with the grill upon which he was burned alive.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bottom row is reserved for female saints. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EAJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Anne</a>, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin’s</a> mother, wears a soft lilac robe and kneels at the front in devotion. Behind her is Saint Thecla,the first female martyr, a contemporary of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostle</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Paul</a>. She is placed just below <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6P-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Stephen</a>, in green, the first male <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyr</a>. The saint holding the lamb is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Agnes</a>, her name relating to the Latin for ‘Lamb of God’, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Agnus dei</span>. Towards the back, the saint in pink with the cross under her arm is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Helena</a>, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> empress who found the relic of Christ’s cross. At the very back are certain nun-saints dressed in their habits, including <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EGE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Bridget of Sweden</a>, who holds a lighted candle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D3Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">panel to the left of the central scene</a>, this one also includes some silver leaf – now blackened – in the decoration of the saints' costumes: look for the helmet of a saint wearing armour, towards the back of the middle row.</p></div>

Behind her are two groups of saints; the apostle Peter, with a book and the keys of heaven promised to him by Christ, is next to her. Each saint is painted in great detail, their faces as individual as their costumes. They carry objects associated with their lives or the instruments of their death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Dominic, the founder of the Dominican Order of nuns and friars, is in the top row, wearing the Order’s black and white habit and carrying a lily, his symbol. The church that this panel was made for was in a Dominican convent.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel is part of a group of images that formed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0I1V-0001-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece made by Fra Angelico</a> for the church of San Domenico, Fiesole, near Florence. Its saints look towards the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CQH-0001-0000-0000.htm">central panel</a> and to Christ, who appears on it, resurrected from the dead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin Mary kneels at the top right, a blue cloak over her head and a star at her shoulder. She holds her hands together in devotion before Christ, her son. Behind her two groups of saints also kneel. Next to her we see <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a>, carrying a book and the keys to the kingdom of heaven, promised to him by Jesus. The bearded figure behind him is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Paul</a>. He carries a sword – a reminder that he was beheaded for his faith. Its blade once shone silver but the silver leaf has tarnished and blackened.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the front group, the figures carrying pens (and some with books) are probably supposed to represent the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFS-0008-0000-0000.htm">Four Evangelists</a> who wrote the Gospels. Curiously, given that most of the inscriptions in these panels are legible, the saint beneath the Virgin Mary holds out a book with writing represented by scribbles. The others might be disciples, and the figure in the pink and yellow cloak in the centre of the middle row may be Saint Barnabas, the patron saint of the altarpiece’s donor, Barnaba degli Agli. The saint also appears on the panel’s main tier, which is still in San Domenico in Fiesole.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Behind this group is another gathering of saints. Their clothes reflect their occupations and status, and they carry objects associated with events in their lives – or the instruments of their death. In the top row, wearing the black and white habit of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a> is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EBT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Dominic</a>, its founder. He carries a lily, his usual symbol. In the same row are several bishop saints, identified by their hats, called mitres. One, in a blue cope decorated with gold fleur-de-lis, carries three golden balls on a red book. This is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Nicholas of Bari</a>, and the balls represent the bags of gold that, according to his legend, he secretly donated to three poor sisters, throwing them through the women’s open window at night.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the head of the middle row is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, who lived in the fourth century. Jerome, as here, was often depicted in the outfit of a cardinal – including the red hat – even though the role of cardinal did not exist in his lifetime; it was an indication of his status in the Church as an advisor to Pope Damasus I. He carries a pen and an open book. The legible inscription bears the name Eustochium, the saint to whom he wrote letters.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The front row is dominated by saints from religious orders: Carmelite monks (the order was founded on Mount Carmel, in the Holy Land) dressed in white, with others in brown habits, possibly Hieronymites (an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Augustinian</a> order of hermits inspired by Saint Jerome). The monks are tonsured – their hair is shaved, leaving only a ring of hair around the edges – a sign of religious devotion. The ageing man with long grey hair and beard is Saint Paul, the First Hermit. His extraordinary dress is not fabric but a textile made from woven palm leaves.</p></div>

On the right is the thief who, according to the Bible, mocked Christ. He is tormented by two devils – they hold a brazier, representing hell, over his head. On the left is ‘the good thief’, shown with a halo, who believed in Christ; two angels take his soul, represented as a small baby, to heaven. Christ’s blood is gathered in chalices by angels.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">One man raises a stick with a vinegar-soaked sponge intended to quench Christ’s thirst, an incident mentioned in all the Gospels apart from Luke. Between the crosses, Roman soldiers on horseback guard the site, their spears raised. One of them, to the right of Christ, has a blue polygonal halo. He is probably the centurion mentioned in the Gospel of Luke who recognised Christ as the Son of God.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the foreground a vast crowd is gathered. To the left, soldiers draw straws for Christ’s clothes, as mentioned in the Gospel of John; others cluster at the far right, behind a group of priests or <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F0E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pharisees</a>. The central group shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> collapsing in grief and supported by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a>, recognisable by her red robes and long red hair. Saint John the Evangelist stands slightly apart from them, raising his hand to his face in grief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting is an adaptation of the standard format of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a>, although much smaller. The central image is flanked by two sets of full-length saints stacked on top of each other, like pilaster saints (standing figures which decorated the pilasters – supporting piers – of large-scale altarpieces). The lowest edge consists of four half-length figures of saints surrounding a central image of the Virgin and Child, painted in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQU-0008-0000-0000.htm">roundels</a>. This layer stands in for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> which ran along the bottom of polyptychs. The entire construction is framed by decorative pilasters and crowned with a canopy known as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPF-0008-0000-0000.htm">baldachin</a>. This resembles the vaults of a fourteenth-century church and, like those, it is painted blue with gold stars to represent heaven.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Clues within the picture suggest that it might have been made for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FEH-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cistercian</a> nunnery: Saints <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedict</a> and Bernard, the two foremost saints of the Cistercian Order, flank the Virgin and Child in the predella. The prominent position of women in the scene, particularly Mary Magdalene, and the inclusion of two female saints in the predella indicates that the original location may have been a nunnery. The likely candidate seems to be Santa Maria Maddalena di Cestello, the Cistercian nunnery dedicated to Mary Magdalene in Florence. The painting might have sat upon the high altar there, which was flanked by chapels dedicated to Saint Benedict and Saint Bernard, or possibly in the chapter house, where scenes of the Crucifixion were traditionally found.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A little black hog peeks out from next to Saint Benedict – it’s a later addition, perhaps intended to transform him into Saint Anthony, who is often shown accompanied by the creature.</p></div>

Included here are saints that were significant to the family: Saint Stephen in the front row, for example, was the patron saint of the guild that controlled the Florentine wool trade. He has a stone on his head which refers to his death by stoning.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was part of the main tier of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">a large, four-tiered altarpiece</a>, and was placed to the left of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXT-0001-0000-0000.htm">a central panel</a> that showed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETK-0008-0000-0000.htm">coronation of the Virgin</a>. It was made for the church of San Pier Maggiore, one of the oldest and most respected churches in Florence. In it, we see saints arranged in five orderly rows that ascend diagonally towards the panel’s right edge, where it meets the central image.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Each saint has been painted in great detail. They each wear different robes (often highly decorated), have different hairstyles and hair colours, and carry objects that identify them. Often, they are painted with objects associated with their martyrdom: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6P-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Stephen</a>, shown kneeling in the front row, has a flat white stone on his head, a reminder that he was stoned to death for his Christian faith. Next to him, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Bartholomew</a>, who was skinned alive, carries a large knife.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the right of Bartholomew is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a> wearing his usual colours of yellow and blue. He carries a large key and, balanced on his knee, is a model of San Pier Maggiore. The key represents the keys to the kingdom of heaven that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> had promised him; the building reminds the viewer that Peter is the patron saint of the church, but also that Christ told Peter that he was the rock upon which he would build his church (Matthew 16: 18). He is placed in the position of honour, at the Virgin’s right hand. Many of the saints wear elaborate robes, and the gold leaf decoration would have twinkled in the candlelit church. Saint Mary Magdalene’s red robe, prominent at the left edge of the second tier, is embroidered with the Greek letters ‘IHS’ and ‘XPS’, standing for ‘Jesus’ and ‘Christus’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saints included have been carefully selected, probably by the wealthy Florentine Albizzi family who paid for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">the altarpiece</a>. Saint Peter was the name saint of Piero di Filippo degli Albizzi (who died in 1379), who may have been the painting’s chief patron. He was a director of one of the wool companies owned by the Albizzi family, who made their money trading in this commodity. Saint Stephen was the patron saint of the Florentine wool guild and therefore an important saint for the family, explaining his prominence here.  Bartholomew was a common name in the Albizzi family and one particular man, Bartolommeo di Gherardo degli Albizzi (who had died by 1385), was a director of another wool company at the time that the altarpiece was commissioned. His daughter was a nun at convent of San Pier Maggiore. Another Albizzi, Bartolommeo di bellincione degli Albizzi (who died 7 July 1400) was married to a woman called Maddalena, after Mary Magdalene, who occupies an important position here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Zenobius</a>, Florence’s patron saint and first bishop, is shown centrally in the second row, wearing his bishop’s mitre. The altarpiece played an important role in the ordination of the Bishop of Florence, forming the backdrop to part of the ceremony when the Bishop would sit in a throne in front of this picture. This might be why <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a>, at the right of the second row, is shown holding open his gospel at the words of Revelation: ‘a great multitude... from every nation... standing before the throne and before the Lamb...’ (Revelation 7: 9).</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saints arranged neatly in rows look towards the central panel – which shows Christ crowning the Virgin Mary – of the four-tiered altarpiece that this picture comes from. A panel on the other side of the central image mirrors the scene here. Together, these three panels formed the main level of the altarpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece was commissioned for the Florentine convent church of San Pier Maggiore, where it formed the backdrop to a ceremony related to the ordination of every new bishop of Florence. The bishop would offer a ring to the convent abbess to signifiy his spritual marriage to the church. This may explain the prominence of Saint Catherine of Alexandria, shown on the right of the front row in a pink dress, who was symbolically married to Christ.</p></div>

      <div class="panel">
        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of three panels of the main tier of a large <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece made for the Benedictine convent church of San Pier Maggiore</a>, Florence. It was placed to the right of a central image showing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXT-0001-0000-0000.htm">coronation of the Virgin</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see saints arranged in neat rows, looking respectfully towards the coronation. As in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZN-0001-0000-0000.htm">panel to the left</a> of the central scene, the saints are painted in detail. While their facial features are quite similar, the artist has taken care to show their individuality though their skin tone, hair colour and costume. They can be identified by the objects that they hold – their attributes. These are often the instruments used to torture them for their Christian faith. Kneeling at the front is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a>, resting her right arm on the spiked wheel upon which she was tortured before being beheaded. The palm she carries is a symbol of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZ6-0008-0000-0000.htm">martyrdom</a>. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENC-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Lawrence</a> holds one too, along with the grill upon which he was burned.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in the left-hand panel, several of the saints depicted here had particular significance for the wealthy commissioners of the altarpiece, the Albizzi family. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Agnes</a>, shown in the second row in blue, holds a lamb – her name means lamb in Latin – which connects to the Albizzi family’s fortune, which had come from trading in wool.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The choice of saints also reflects the altarpiece’s use as a backdrop to an important religious ceremony. When a new bishop of Florence was appointed, he was enthroned before this picture and offered the nuns of the convent a ring. This symbolised his marriage to the church, which had been founded by the first bishop of the city and patron saint, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Zenobius</a>. Saint Catherine of Alexandria, according to legend, was married to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> when he offered her a ring. The city’s other patron saint, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>, can be seen at the front of the second row at Christ’s right hand. The camel-hair tunic tells us who he is, as this is what he wore while preaching in the wilderness. His right hand hints at his role as a prophet: he gesticulates as though speaking.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The position of the saints in the panels relates to their significance but also to the traditional format of pairing particular saints together. Saint Lawrence, at the edge of the front row, appears opposite<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6P-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Saint Stephen</a> in the left panel, a conventional pairing. Other pairings were less usual but still explain the position of the saints. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a>, in the penultimate row and wearing a red cardinal’s hat, is shown next to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Augustine</a>, who had a vision of Jerome after his death. This visual network of associations adds meaning and complexity to what looks like a simple functional arrangement.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At Pentecost, after Christ’s death, his disciples were imbued with the Holy Ghost, shown here as a dove. Tongues of fire appeared on their heads and they were able to speak multiple languages.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The disciples are seated in a circle in the upper storey of a house, with the Virgin Mary and Saint Peter in the centre. We can see red flames – tongues of fire – on their heads. On the street below, people wearing different types of clothing and hats listen in at the door. They represent the Jews from all different nations, who gathered to hear the disciples speaking in their languages.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel comes from a large altarpiece made for the Florentine church of San Pier Maggiore. Saint Peter’s central position reflects the church’s dedication to him. This panel formed the last picture in a series of narratives of Christ’s life and death that was situated above the altarpiece’s main tier.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel was once framed with a scene showing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4K-0001-0000-0000.htm">ascension of Christ into heaven</a>, and is the last in a narrative series focusing on key moments in the life of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, including his death, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">resurrection</a> and ascension. This sequence of six paintings formed the middle tier of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">large multi-panelled altarpiece</a> made for the Florentine convent church of San Pier Maggiore. The central scene showed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXT-0001-0000-0000.htm">coronation of the Virgin</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRD-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pentecost</a> is the name of an event that happened 50 days after the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a> were gathered together to celebrate the Jewish Feast of Weeks when, according to the Bible, a strong wind began to blow and flames like ‘tongues of fire’ appeared on their heads. The disciples were filled with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and began to speak miraculously in a number of languages. Those around them were amazed – they thought that the disciples must be drunk.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see the disciples sat in a circle in an upstairs room or perhaps a covered walkway, with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a> in the centre. Each has a flame on their head. The upper part of the panel shows a white dove flying downwards into the room, emitting golden rays – incised into the gold leaf background – from his beak. The artist has included the windows on the back wall of the room so that we can see all the way through it, giving an impression of its depth. As in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4K-0001-0000-0000.htm">previous scene</a> Saint Peter and the Virgin Mary are shown in the most prominent positions. Saint Peter is even holding his symbol, a key, as in the main tier, so that his identity cannot be mistaken. His prominence is appropriate given the church’s dedication to Saint Peter.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The biblical account mentions that a crowd of Jews visiting the city from Mesopotamia, Egypt and Rome gathered to hear the disciples speaking about God in languages they could understand. We see them here on the street below. Some look up, their hands raised in wonder, while two figures listen in at the doors, which are slightly ajar. The artist has shown these men wearing a variety of head coverings, from hoods to crowns to brimmed hats, perhaps to emphasise their diverse and foreign origins. This moment is significant for Christ’s followers: it gave them the authority to continue preaching his message to all nations.</p></div>

They are the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE4-0008-0000-0000.htm">cherubim</a>, a different rank of angelic being.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Below them hover four other angels. Two wear coloured robes; one plays a fiddle and another the double recorder. In front of them is another pair, dressed in white, who both swing thuribles containing incense. The one at the front holds a boat-shaped vessel called a nef which was used to hold incense.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The heavenly figures in this panel are decorative but they also look towards the scared image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Trinity</a> at the centre in adoration, emphasising its importance. The music they play and the incense they swing suggests a multi-sensory experience and encourages the viewer to imagine the sounds and scents of heaven.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel is the second in a series of scenes of the life of Christ, part of a multi-panelled altarpiece made for the church of San Pier Maggiore, Florence. This sequence ran above the altarpiece’s main tier, which showed the coronation of the Virgin surrounded by adoring saints.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see three kings followed by their courtly entourage – complete with horses and camels – paying homage to the infant Christ. The kings in their colourful robes kneel before the baby, one cradling his little foot, about to kiss it. They offer him gifts: small jars containing, according to the Gospel accounts, gold and the spices frankincense and myrhh. The kings had a special importance in Florence, as they shared their feast day (6 January) with the city’s patron saint, John the Baptist.</p></div>

This sequence formed the middle tier of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HVQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">large multi-panelled altarpiece</a> made for the Florentine convent church of San Pier Maggiore.

The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> kneel before the Christ Child, who is presented to them by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>. The bearded king takes one of Christ’s tiny feet in his hand to kiss it; his crown lies on the floor, removed in deference to the baby.  He has offered the child a lidded jar containing his gift. According to the Bible, the kings brought gold and precious spices (frankincense and myrrh). Christ blesses the king while <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> takes the gift.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Together the kings form part of a harmonious trio of red, blue and green. Kneeling at different heights so that they are all visible, they are followed by an entourage of attendants that winds its way around the craggy rock. There are animals, too: two horses – one neighing vigorously, his head rearing upwards – provide transport for the royal train. A pair of camels, also harnessed, look agitated in the crowd and a weasel or a stoat creeps away from the hubbub of the scene in the lower foreground.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The kings, sometimes known as the wise men or ‘magi’, were important to religious life in Florence. This was because the Epiphany, the feast at which they were celebrated (6 January), was shared with the Feast of the Baptism of Christ, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a> was one of the city’s patron saints (he appears on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F1Y-0001-0000-0000.htm">panel to the right of the altarpiece’s central scene</a>).

At either side an angel with a flame, representing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, looks on. The blue backdrop sets off their splendid white robes, decorated with golden birds and flowers which would have gleamed when lit by candles. Christ places a star-topped crown upon the Virgin’s head. She bows her head, crossing her arms in front of her in a gesture of humility. Her delicate profile is made up of just a few simple strokes. The painter has drawn attention to her eyes, which look down, defining the edges of the lids with one definitive stroke.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The coronation of the Virgin took place according the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Golden Legend</span>, the thirteenth-century compilation of the lives of the saints, after her <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6O-0008-0000-0000.htm">miraculous assumption to heaven</a>. This was an important event: the Virgin became a part of the heavenly realm, with the saints, and could be called upon in prayer to intercede for the faithful. It was a popular scene in Florence and this image, like many <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0IDI-0001-0000-0000.htm">others made there</a>, drew upon the version painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a> for the Baroncelli chapel around 1334.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Angels playing musical instruments have gathered around the base of the throne, and their symmetrical arrangement frames the coronation. The decorative details of their costumes and instruments add pattern and richness to the scene. The instruments, for example the tiny guitar-like gittern and the larger fiddle, are painted with decorations that resemble marquetry, a technique that uses different coloured woods to make patterns. This angelic orchestra might inspire the viewer to imagine that the scene is accompanied by heavenly music, adding to the sensory experience created by the painting’s colours and textures.</p></div>

The ox and donkey, more used to eating hay from the manger, lie beside it, while two groups of angels hover above. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits on the other side, her hands pressed together in prayer, while <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>, wearing a lilac cloak, looks on. Behind a rocky crag two shepherds also look on in adoration. We know they are shepherds: in the hills above the stable, we see them with sheep and a sheep dog, shielding their eyes from the blinding light of an angel carrying a lily, a symbol of the Virgin’s purity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to the Gospel of Luke (Luke 2: 7–16), the angel appeared to the shepherds at night to tell them of Jesus’s birth. The artist has painted this scene using only black, olive-green and yellow. The limited colour gives the impression that this is a night-time scene, but the use of yellow suggests that the angel’s light is an illuminating force. This is one of the earliest example of a panel painting with a gold background showing a night scene, though it had been shown in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> by Taddo Gaddi in the Baroncelli Chapel in the church of Santa Croce in Florence.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Roman soldiers who have been posted to guard Christ’s tomb from grave robbers have fallen asleep. Christ has risen from his grave and is shown above his tomb holding a white flag with a red cross, a symbol of the Resurrection. The lid of the tomb is still closed, emphasising the miracle of the Resurrection – something that the soldiers couldn't have been prepared for even if they had been awake. Christ wears a white and gold robe, which would have shimmered in the candlelight against the gold background, reflecting the heavenly nature of the event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel comes from a four-tiered altarpiece made for the church of San Pier Maggiore in Florence. It belongs to a sequence of narrative scenes showing events from Christ’s birth, Resurrection and Ascension. They were situated above the panels of the main tier, which show the coronation of the Virgin surrounded by adoring saints.</p></div>

The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXT-0001-0000-0000.htm">central scene</a> showed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETK-0008-0000-0000.htm">coronation of the Virgin Mary</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ, dressed in white and gold flowing robes lined with red, is the focus of the scene. He rises from his tomb and ascends majestically to heaven, carrying a flag that symbolises the Resurrection. The artist has incised the gold leaf of the sky with multiple fine lines that would have reflected the candlelight of the altar below and made Christ appear as though he was glowing. The surrounding trees reflect this golden light.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Below him, surrounding his tomb, seven Roman soldiers have fallen asleep: they do not notice the miraculous heavenly event taking place. Their helmets and shields are inscribed with the letters SPQR, the abbreviation of the title for the Roman state: <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Senatus Populusque Romanus</span> (‘the Senate and people of Rome’). They were posted by the tomb to ensure that Christ’s body was not stolen and no claims of a false resurrection were made by Jesus’s followers. Christ’s resurrection, however, was real and, as this scene shows, occurred without the tomb even being opened – stressing how mistaken the Roman authorities were to send guards.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist may have drawn inspiration for the composition from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> in the so-called Spanish chapel of the Florentine church of Santa Maria Novella painted only a decade earlier by Andrea da Firenze.</p></div>

They were the first to receive news of the Resurrection: when they arrived the tomb was empty. They saw two men ‘in dazzling apparel’ who asked them, ‘Why do you seek the living among the dead? Remember how he told you, while he was still in Galilee that the Son of man must be delivered into the hands of sinful men, and be crucified, and on the third day rise’(Luke 24: 4–8). The two men are interpreted here as angels sitting on the open tomb. When the women told the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a>, they were not believed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The three women are lined up by the tomb, with Mary Magdalene dressed in red as she was usually depicted. All three carry the jars with spices in them. The landscape, the rocks, and even the foliage of the plants is continuous with the panel <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F44-0001-0000-0000.htm">showing the Resurrection</a> and the setting is the same: Christ’s tomb. Even so, the artist has used a slightly different viewpoint in this scene to that of the Resurrection, which shows the tomb head on. This has allowed him to show the interior of the tomb and prove its emptiness.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, unlike the Resurrection panel, the trees in the distance are shown in clear daylight – their fruit and leaves are visible. The grass in the foreground is dotted with a variety of different flowers including blue grape hyacinths.</p></div>

His limbs and torso are gaunt; his diaphragm and the bones of his ribs show through his skin. Blood pours from the wounds of his palms, side and feet. Above his halo hovers the Holy Ghost, depicted traditionally in the form of the dove.

The symmetrical format of the picture and its simplicity is appropriate for its central position at the very top of the altarpiece, high above worshippers, where its bold colours and simple shapes would ensure it stood out.</p></div>

The saints stand on a lavish red, blue and gold textile dotted with vine tendrils, birds – identified as finches – and carnations. Carnations, also known as dianthus (’flower of God‘), were associated with Christ’s suffering and death: they smell like cloves, which were thought to resemble the nails used at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. The textile has been painted using the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffito</span> technique, in which an area is covered in gold leaf and then red paint, which is scratched away in areas to reveal the designs. Some parts are given extra detail using deep blue ultramarine paint, a very expensive <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When the National Gallery bought the picture in 1858 it was described as having come from the ’hospital church‘ – a church connected to a hospital – of Santi Giovanni e Niccolò in Florence. At the time the picture was made the church had a different name and was dedicated to Saint John the Baptist – explaining his prominence in the panel, and the absence of Saint Nicholas. The hospital was run by the Knights Hospitaller, a religious order that had a military function and also a tradition of caring for the sick. The order was also known as the Knights of Saint John because of their patron saint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece was most likely paid for by the Benini family, who had founded the church. In his will, Bindo di Lapo Benini had left the church to the Knights in accordance with the wishes of his brother, who had been the prior of the Knights Hospitaller in Pisa. Saint James was probably chosen to honour to their father, Lapo (short for Jacopo, the Italian for James).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saints were originally separated by twisting colonettes (small columns). Saints John the Baptist and James are on the same panel, which is unusual: saints were normally painted on separate panels. The figures are all full length, of equal size – and therefore importance – and stand on the same piece of fabric. This represents a transition between the traditional <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> and the single-panel altarpiece known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">pala</a></span>, which became the standard form in the sixteenth century. <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Pala</span> altarpieces showed <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sacra conversazione</span> (’holy conversations'), where saints occupy the same spatial setting as though they are speaking with one another. The tops of the panel have been cut down and may have been pointed originally. There were probably additional <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXD-0008-0000-0000.htm">pinnacle</a> panels, now lost, on top of this section.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The coronation of the Virgin was a very popular subject in Florentine painting. Inspiration for the images came not from the Bible but from legends recounting the Virgin’s glorious reception into heaven by Christ, where she took her place by his side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Daddi and his large workshop of assistants painted several versions of the coronation. This one reflects a work by Giotto, both in the bulkiness of the figures and the Virgin’s crossed arms. This gesture of humility was more often found in images of the Annunciation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It remains unclear whether this panel formed the centre of a large altarpiece but we do know that it was cut down and altered. A painting now in Christ Church Picture Gallery, Oxford, showing four angels playing musical instruments with saints, formed the lowest part of the picture. The remnants of the saints’ haloes were once visible here, but they were painted over some time before it entered the National Gallery’s collection.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting looks complete but it is in fact one part of a larger image. It was cut in two sometime before 1828 probably so that each section could be sold separately. The lower part entered the collection of Christ Church, Oxford, in 1828.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> is crowned by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. Her glorious reception in heaven, after her death, is not described in the Bible but in the thirteenth-century compilation of lives of the saints, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, where she takes her place on a throne by Christ’s side. Such passages would have inspired sumptuous representations such as this. The pose of the Virgin, her arms crossed in a gracious gesture, comes from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>’s version of the scene painted for the Baroncelli Chapel in Florence. It recalls images of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>, when the Virgin humbly received the news that she was chosen by God to be the mother of his son. Its use here may be intended to remind the viewer of the importance of humility and the acceptance of God’s will in Christian life.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the only picture by the Florentine painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PGM-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bernardo Daddi</a>, who had a large and prolific workshop, in the National Gallery’s collection. It is, however, a good example of his admiration for the highly decorative style of painting in the neighbouring Tuscan city of Siena. The Virgin’s halo is adorned with a wreath of roses, incised into the gold leaf; the edges are imprinted with small rosettes and dots, made with metal tools called punches. Pattern abounds across the picture: the Virgin’s robe is decorated with a now-worn gilded pattern, with red and blue outlines; it is similar to the gold, green and blue fleur-de-lis pattern of the textile hung upon the throne.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture in Oxford shows four angels kneeling before the steps of a throne that resembles the one in this picture. Behind them are two figures, identifiable only by their clothing as the panel was cut just beneath their heads. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a> is on the left; the saint on the right has been identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6P-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Stephen</a>. X-ray images of the National Gallery panel show the remains of three haloes, one to the Virgin’s left and two to Christ’s right. They are not visible to the naked eye, as they have been scraped off and painted over, but if you look closely you can see Saint John’s fingers showing through where the paint of the Virgin’s mantle has worn. It is likely that the arrangement of figures was symmetrical and that there was another saint behind John the Baptist. No evidence of that figure remains as the panel was cut down at the left edge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The original painting, then, showed the coronation with four angels kneeling and playing instruments at the base of the throne, with two pairs of saints standing on either side. The angels and saints are of a much smaller scale than the imposing figures of Christ and the Virgin above. It is unclear whether it was an independent painting, or if the picture was the central panel of a larger altarpiece.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a very unusual depiction of the Virgin Mary. She is shown standing, with eyes trained towards the viewer, the Christ Child perched in the crook of her arm. Her attire is exceptionally sumptuous and, as with the garments of the surrounding angels, it reflects contemporary Florentine fashions.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of costume would have looked out of place on an altarpiece, but it’s possible that the painting was made for someone who would have placed it in their bedroom to worship privately. These sorts of private images of the Virgin and Child were often made for women – in this case, perhaps a very wealthy woman who would have been able to identify more closely with the Virgin if she resembled one of her contemporaries. There is some evidence that images like this were given as wedding gifts.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> in this painting is majestic – she looks directly at us while holding the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> in her left arm. The Christ Child, equally regal, makes a blessing gesture towards the figures below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin’s standing pose is unusual for an image of this size. It shows off her elegant velvet gown, which is woven with a pattern and lined and trimmed with ermine fur. If you look closely, you‘ll see it is edged with gold tassels. Her large jewelled crown sits on top of a semi-transparent veil. Christ’s elaborate outfit, complete with fur-lined cape, is a miniature version of his mother’s but includes even more gold embroidery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The details of their clothes reflect fashionable outfits of the period – this is clothing that wealthy Florentines would have aspired to wear in the mid-fifteenth century. The Virgin’s belt is high on her waist, a trend that was fashionable in the late 1440s or early 1450s. The angels surrounding the Virgin and Child wear patterned hose (stockings) and fur-trimmed tunics with sleeves decorated with gold thread – clothes that resemble men’s fashion in Florence in the 1440s and up until the early 1450s. If it weren’t for the tiny wings which poke out at their shoulders, we might think they were page boys attending to a queen.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The other references to the divine are equally subtle. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FE4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Cherubim</a> are inscribed into the gold background rather than painted. The flowers held by two of the angels are carnations, which symbolised the nails of the Crucifixion (they smell like cloves, which look like nails). Their Greek name, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">dianthos</span>, means ‘flower of God’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The secular qualities of the image may indicate that this work was painted for a domestic setting rather than a church. It is possible that the painting was made for someone who would have placed it in their home to worship privately. These sorts of private images of the Virgin and Child were often made for women – in this case, perhaps a wealthy woman who would have been able to identify more closely with the Virgin if she resembled one of her contemporaries. There is some evidence that images like this were given as wedding gifts.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A crowd of saints dressed in glowing colours gather on an elaborately decorated floor. Their crowns and haloes glisten with burnished gold, and gold embroidery edges their robes and vestments. This is the company of heaven as imagined in fourteenth-century Italy. Many hold objects or wear clothes which would have allowed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> viewer to identify them immediately: saints, who were seen as able to intervene with God on behalf of sinful humankind, were shown with attributes that related to their lives or deaths.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was part of a very large and complex polyptych (a multi-panelled altarpiece) painted by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Monaco</a> for the monastery of San Benedetto fuori della Porta Pinti in Florence. Other panels from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HT4-0001-0000-0000.htm">same altarpiece</a> are also in our collection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Like many early Renaissance paintings, the altarpiece has suffered drastic changes in appearance over the centuries. The saints are looking at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FMC-0001-0000-0000.htm">coronation of the Virgin</a> at the centre of the altarpiece; there were <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F79-0001-0000-0000.htm">more adoring saints</a> on the other side. These are now separate, but they were originally constructed and painted as a single panel (you can just see – on the far right of this painting – the wings of angels who surround the Virgin’s throne). We don‘t know exactly when it was split into three, but at that point two vertical bands about seven centimetres wide were lost between the side and main panels. These missing sections have been reconstructed in the gallery on structural elements of the modern frame.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">San Benedetto was a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EST-0008-0000-0000.htm">Camaldolese</a> monastery and the saints chosen were those who were important to the monks. On the far left is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Benedict</a>, founder of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictine Order</a>. He holds a book inscribed with words from his Rule, or code of practice, which the Camaldolites followed, and wears white in place of his usual black, as did they. Beside him, in a pink robe over a hair tunic, is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a>, patron saint of Florence. He was a hermit and a role model for the austere Camaldolites. Next to him is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EU4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Matthew</a>, whose book has words from his Gospel. In the back rows are other patron saints of Florence, along with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis</a>, founder of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a>; <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6P-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Stephen</a>, with the rocks of his martyrdom balanced on his head; and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EVR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Paul</a>, carrying the sword with which he was beheaded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bright colours and gilding are typical of painting in Florence around 1400. Although the figures are painted to look three-dimensional, and the throne and floor are shown in a basic linear perspective, the light does not fall consistently from one direction and the drapery folds are arranged across the picture in rhythmic patterns. Lorenzo Monaco wasn’t trying to show a real space, but was using decorative effects to evoke the kingdom of heaven.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting shows two stories from the life of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Benedict</a> happening at once. Benedict, reading in his cell, had a vision that one of his disciples was drowning. On the left, we see him tell Saint Maurus to run down to the lake and rescue Saint Placidus, who has fallen in while fetching water. Maurus has walked out on to the lake as if it were land and is pulling Placidus – still grasping his jug – out by the hair. On the right, Benedict visits his sister, Saint Scholastica, who is near death. When he refuses her invitation to stay the night, she prays for him to remain and a miraculous rainstorm prevents him leaving; you can see the rain lashing the roof.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Maurus’s halo was initially left out, perhaps by mistake, and was added later using a type of lead-white oil mordant (or adhesive) that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QDJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Monaco</a> used elsewhere in the altarpiece.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although members of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FG8-0008-0000-0000.htm">Benedictine Order</a> wore black, here they are dressed in the white habits of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EST-0008-0000-0000.htm">Camaldolese Order</a>, founded in the eleventh century as a reformed branch of the Benedictines, as this panel was painted for them. It comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HT4-0001-0000-0000.htm">a large polyptych</a> (a multi-panelled altarpiece) painted for a church just outside Florence. That church, San Benedetto fuori della Porta Pinti, was eventually destroyed, but it belonged to the Camaldolese Order. Saint Benedict was the church’s patron saint, and the small scenes in the predella show episodes from his life (another is also in our collection – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GE9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Benedict admitting Saints Maurus and Placidus into the Benedictine Order</a></span>). A third panel, showing Saint Benedict’s death, is on permanent loan to the National Gallery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The predella originally had three compartments with two scenes in each. When they were in the altarpiece, the predella panels were set into shaped compartments in the base of the frame, which diagonally covered the top and bottom left-hand corners. When the frame was removed it left unpainted triangles which have been filled in with modern paint. The predella panels seem to have been done by different painters, presumably assistants in Monaco’s workshop.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scenes in the predella emphasise not just Benedict but the role of his followers, especially youthful monks, and the power of prayer and obedience. They would have been very suitable for San Benedetto, only recently founded as a dependent house of Santa Maria degli Angeli in Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don't know exactly when the altarpiece was taken apart, but the predella panels show no sign of the water damage which affects the main tier panels. If, as seems likely, this damage was caused by the devastating floods of 1557 in Florence, the predella must have been separated from the rest of the altarpiece before then, probably in 1529 when the church at San Benedetto was destroyed.</p></div>

It comes from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HT4-0001-0000-0000.htm">a large polyptych</a> (a multi-panelled altarpiece) painted for a church just outside Florence. Saint Benedict was the church’s patron saint, and the small scenes in the predella show episodes from his life (another is also in our collection – <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENE-0001-0000-0000.htm">Incidents in the Life of Saint Benedict: Predella Panel</a></span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The predella originally had three compartments with two scenes in each. This panel, which was at the far left, was next to a scene now in the Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome: the painted landscape continues from one to the other and the pattern of the wood grain on the back matches, showing that they were painted on the same plank. When they were in the altarpiece, the predella panels were set into shaped compartments in the base of the frame, which diagonally covered the top and bottom left-hand corners. When the frame was removed it left unpainted triangles which have been filled in with modern paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don't know exactly when the altarpiece was taken apart, but the predella panels show no sign of the water damage which affects the main tier panels. If, as seems likely, this was caused by the devastating floods of 1557 in Florence, the predella must have been separated from the main altarpiece before then – probably in 1529 when the church at San Benedetto was destroyed.</p></div>

It was repeated on many fourteenth- and fifteenth-century Florentine altarpieces (like Jacopo di Cione’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXT-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Coronation of the Virgin</a></span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The gorgeous colours are carefully arranged to complement each other and set up visual harmonies across the panel. Christ’s brilliant blue mantle – painted with <span class="dokuwiki_italic">lapis lazuli</span>, a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> more expensive than gold – is set off by the glowing yellow of its lining and the pink of his tunic; all are echoed in the dress of the angel with the portative organ who kneels before the throne. On either side of the throne angels with golden hair and delicate pink cheeks gaze up adoringly, their lips open in songs of praise, their careful symmetry emphasised by their matching outfits.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Lorenzo Monaco was especially skilled at gilding techniques. The gilding of the background and haloes was done first, before the painting, and you can see the red <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FTF-0008-0000-0000.htm">bole</a> where the gold of the background has worn away. The haloes of the angels, Christ and the Virgin were burnished and then stamped with different punches to create patterns which would have flickered in the candlelight.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">sgraffito</span> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSA-0008-0000-0000.htm">cloth of honour</a> was painted with vermilion, a red pigment, over burnished gold that was punched to suggest raised gold threads. The cushion on which Christ and the Virgin sit has been modelled by punching to suggest the light and shade of its folded fabric. Mordant gilding, where gold leaf is applied over a glue, decorates the edges and hems of the draperies: look closely and you can see the delicate fringe around the edge of the Virgin’s veil.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Some of the colours have changed over time: the Virgin’s robe has almost entirely faded from a deep pinkish-mauve to white, and the vermilion of the cloth of honour has darkened. The gilded inscription along the base of the parapet is now almost invisible. At some point an arched doorway was cut into the centre of the panel for a tabernacle to store the bread of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a>. It does not seem to have been original, and had been filled in and painted over before the eighteenth century.</p></div>

At his feet is a lion. It lifts its paw up to the saint and looks at him with an imploring expression. According to legend, when Jerome was living as a monk near Bethlehem he pulled a thorn from a lion’s foot; from that moment it was his companion and protector. In his left hand he holds a Bible, its weighty pages curling over at the top edge. It is open at the first page of the Old Testament which describes the creation of the world.

Saint Jerome was an important saint for the church: he had been baptised by its founder, Saint Liberius, and his relics had been moved there in the thirteenth century.

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The small size and rectangular shape of this panel indicate that it once formed part of a predella – that is the lowest section of an altarpiece. Predellas usually illustrated events from the lives of the saints depicted in the main section of the altarpiece. The saint who is about to be beheaded here, for her Christian faith, has been identified as Saint Margaret of Antioch. This is on account of the cross-shape she has formed with her thumbs as she prays, which may refer to the legend that Saint Margaret fought off the devil – in the form of a dragon – by making the sign of the cross with her hands. Her legend also recounts that she asked to pray before her execution. Starnina, a Florentine painter, has chosen to show the moment at which the executioner is just about to strike. This panel has been connected to an altarpiece in the Martin von Wagner Museum in Würzburg which includes a panel showing Saint Margaret of Antioch, who is shown with a slain dragon at her feet, with Saint Philip.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PQV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gherardo di Jacopo Starnina</a> was an important early fifteenth-century Florentine painter who also worked in Toledo and Valencia in the 1390s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An executioner holds his sword in both hands high above his head, ready to strike; his robes are hitched into to his belt to aid his swoop. A woman, identified as a saint by her halo, kneels in prayer. She appears completely serene, an impression that is emphasised by the way the fabric of her skirt ripples along the ground in neat waves. The stark, rocky setting suits the subject. The execution takes place, as was customary, outside the city, the walls of the fortified town visible in the background. The arid landscape is broken only by a yellow river that encloses the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A crowd has gathered to watch, rows of spectators are pushing through the city gate. Each expresses a different reaction: two figures to the left bow their heads sadly, while another –- probably the town’s ruler– points accusingly at the saint with a baton; another recoils in horror. The ruler wears a turban, while his companion in yellow has an elaborate fan-shaped hat. Starnina has dressed the men in outfits he thought fitting for the eastern Mediterranenan setting, Antioch being in modern-day Turkey. A soldier brandishing a large pike guards the scene. His helmet and shield – as well as the executioner’s sword– may have been covered in silver leaf originally and thus glistened amid the bright colours.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The saint has been identified as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Margaret of Antioch</a>. Her legend tells that she survived a variety of tortures as well as an encounter with the devil in the form of a dragon, who devoured her. She survived by making the sign of the cross – as she does here with her thumbs. Eventually she was beheaded but first was granted time to pray.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is likely that the panel formed part of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> in the Martin von Wagner Museum in Würzburg. The central panel shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">the Virgin</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Child</a> with angels playing musical instruments at her feet. The flanking panels show two pairs of saints each. It is likely, given the subject and the dimensions of this panel, that it was located beneath the left-hand panel showing Saint Philip (though this is debated) and Saint Margaret of Antioch. The saints on the right-hand panel are <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EI5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a>. Various other small fragments from museums across the world have been connected with this altarpiece, including a fragment of identical dimensions now in the Art Institute of Chicago, showing the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ED0-0008-0000-0000.htm">dormition of the Virgin</a>. It was almost certainly placed immediately to the right of the panel showing Margaret’s execution since the wood grain on both panels is continuous, showing that both were painted on the same piece of wood which was later cut up.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The presence of<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5G-0008-0000-0000.htm"> Saint Philip</a> has led to the suggestion that the altarpiece may have been commissioned by a Florentine banker, Filippo di Piero Rinieri for church of Santa Maria in Campo in the parish of Santa Margherita, Florence, where Filippo lived. It probably adorned the altar of a side chapel dedicated to either Saint Margaret or Saint Mary Magdalene.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three men have followed a star – you can see it just inside the stable – to find and pay homage to the newborn <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. These wise men, sometimes called kings – here they all have crowns – are shown kneeling before the Christ Child. One has set his crown aside and kisses the newborn’s foot, showing reverence to him. This story is told in Matthew’s Gospel (Matthew 2: 1–9).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> holds the first king’s gift, a detail that seems to come from earlier paintings of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ET5-0008-0000-0000.htm">adoration of the kings</a> which, like this one, were made in Florence. The other kings await their turn; their gifts, housed in elaborate gilded boxes, are covered in transparent veils, a sign of their sacred nature. The biblical account tells us that they offered gold, frankincense and myrrh – the first a fitting gift for a king and the other two the precious spices used to anoint Christ’s body after his death. The artist has emphasised the wealth and splendour of the kings by including the attendants who have travelled with them; two pages restrain their horses in the background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel has been associated with the Florentine painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QWO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Zanobi Strozzi</a>, who was also a highly skilled manuscript illuminator. The panel does resemble an illumination in a manuscript, which were richly decorated luxury objects. Here, the meadow is filled with a variety of tiny flowers and grasses – some look like daisies – and the costumes of the kings and attendants are embellished with gold patterns. In the 1430s, when this panel was made, Zanobi was working in a similar way to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P9S-0001-0000-0000.htm">Fra Angelico</a> whose style was also highly decorative, often described as ‘courtly’ (meaning it was suitable for a high-status, wealthy client). The Virgin’s gesture – crossing her right hand across her breast – is similar to that in Fra Angelico’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Linaioli Tabernacle</span>, also dated to 1433 and now in the National Museum of San Marco, Florence.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don’t know which altarpiece this <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> panel belonged to but it has been connected with a scene of the Nativity of Christ (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). Technical examination of the two panels show that they were painted on the same piece of wood.</p></div>
