        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting of the Virgin and Child enthroned was once the central element of a large multi-panelled altarpiece made for the oratory of S. Pietro in Vincoli, Faenza. In it, heaven and earth mingle. The Virgin is depicted as Queen of Heaven, although she has no crown: behind her is a green silk cloth of honour, such as was hung behind medieval and Renaissance royalty.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The front edge of the cloth hangs down over the lintel of an elegant but implausible stone structure with a doorway at its centre. On either side of the doorway, oval reliefs show the presentation of the Virgin in the Temple and the marriage of the Virgin; through it, we can see an imaginary landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A fascination with complex stepped architecture had long been a feature of Ferrarese painting, and Costa in 1497 had devised a similar, though even more elaborate, architectural structure for the Ghedini chapel (S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna).</p></div>

Angels kneel in adoration on either side, while two more on the lower level make heavenly music with pipes and a viol.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin and Child enthroned</a> was once the central element of a large <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> possibly made for the oratory of S. Pietro in Vincoli, Faenza (other panels from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HWS-0001-0000-0000.htm">the altarpiece</a> are also in the National Gallery’s collection). In it, heaven and earth mingle. The Virgin is shown as Queen of Heaven, although she has no crown: behind her is a green silk cloth of honour, such as was hung behind <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLD-0008-0000-0000.htm">medieval</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> royalty. It forms a canopy over her head, and has been folded so that its creases make a pattern of squares. The cloth evidently runs under the throne – its front edge hangs down over the lintel of an elegant but implausible stone structure with a doorway at its centre and stone steps which extend into the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpeice</a>’s side panels. At the base, the structure projects forwards to make a seat for the angelic musicians.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An earthly if imaginary landscape is visible through the door – a rolling plain framed by tall slender trees and populated by a number of exotically dressed figures. A man blows a trumpet, a soldier holds a long spear and two figures stand talking next to a man on a horse. On the shore a boat is moored; in the distance a small island with blue towers and spires rises from the water.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A fascination with complex stepped architecture had long been a feature of Ferrarese painting, as can be seen in Cosimo Tura’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FW5-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child Enthroned</a></span> or Francesco del Cossa’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F9E-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Vincent Ferrer</a></span>. Following the example of his teacher, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PNF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ercole de' Roberti</a>, Costa had in 1497 devised a similar, though even more elaborate, architectural structure for the Ghedini chapel (S. Giovanni in Monte, Bologna), with a landscape seen through a doorway beneath the Virgin’s throne and fictive reliefs showing biblical and mythological scenes. Here he chose a simpler setting, with two oval reliefs on either side of the doorway. These show the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F6L-0008-0000-0000.htm">presentation of the Virgin in the Temple</a> and the marriage of the Virgin, the two chief events in her life prior to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>. Perhaps the Annunciation was represented in some way on the original <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FS1-0008-0000-0000.htm">frame</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel, the first of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HY2-0001-0000-0000.htm">a series of three</a>, is based on the story of a young peasant woman called Griselda, as told in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLB-0008-0000-0000.htm">The Decameron</a></span>. Griselda’s rich husband put her through a series of tests, and her loyalty throughout the ordeal earned her fame and respect – she became a model of wifely virtue. The paintings were probably made to celebrate two marriages in the Spanocchi family, which took place in January 1494.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here we see Griselda meet the Marquis Gualtieri di Saluzzo for the first time, as well as the events leading up to their marriage. The story begins at the left of the panel, with Griselda on her way to fetch water from the well, a pot on her head. She catches the eye of the Marquis, who is out hunting with an entourage of courtiers; the hills above are crowded with horses and dogs following the scent of the prey. Transfixed, the Marquis leans forward on his elegant white horse to take a better look at Griselda, and falls in love immediately.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The craggy hill that formed the backdrop to their first meeting is mirrored on the right by a peach-coloured house, which belongs to Griselda’s father. He hurries down the steps as the Marquis approaches to ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage. The next scene is less conventional: Griselda has been stripped naked. Humiliated, she covers her white skin with her arms, in the pose of classical sculptures of the goddess Venus known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Venus Pudica</span> or ‘Venus ashamed’. The Marquis hands her new clothes to wear for their wedding. In the centre, the two are married in front of a structure that looks like a triumphal Roman arch, topped with horses and male figures. Griselda is dressed in expensive gold-woven fabrics that match those of the Marquis.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Accounts of the Spanocchi family wedding feast describe a huge temporary arch which was constructed especially for the occasion and, like the one in the picture, it was decorated with statues of famous warriors. The picture contains other details intended to encourage close examination and to entertain the noble patrons. For example, two lean greyhounds pause to watch Griselda’s humiliation as she tries to cover herself up, and some of the horses' harnesses are decorated with patterns in real gold.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painter has planned every detail of the composition carefully, drawing almost all elements before he began to paint. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that even the horses and dogs on the hillside in the upper left were drawn directly onto the panel, the background painted around them before they were filled in at a later stage.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the second panel in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HY2-0001-0000-0000.htm">a series of three</a> based on a fourteenth-century story about a peasant girl named Griselda. She was put through a series of cruel tests by her rich husband, the Marquis Gualtieri di Saluzzo – we see three of them in this painting. Griselda’s loyalty throughout her ordeal earned her fame and respect, and she became a model of wifely virtue. The paintings were commissioned for a room in the Spanocchi family palace in Siena, and were probably made to celebrate two family marriages which took place in January 1494.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Marquis first told Griselda that he had ordered the killing of their children; in the background on the left, two tiny babies in white swaddling bandages are secretly carried away. Next, he pretended that he had annulled their marriage. Under the elaborately carved and gilded loggia (arcade) at the centre of the scene, Griselda, in the same fine gown she wore <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FC5-0001-0000-0000.htm"> at her wedding</a>, places her wedding ring on the cloth held by the man conducting the sham annulment ceremony. We see her again in the next arcade, half-undressed: now divorced, she returns her beautiful clothes. Expelled from the company of the courtiers, wearing only her underdress, she returns to her father’s house. Her final appearance on this panel shows her walking up the winding path to the stone farmhouse.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in the panels showing the couple’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FC5-0001-0000-0000.htm">marriage</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0001-0000-0000.htm">reunion</a>, the artist has included an array of animals here, this time quite exotic: a bear, tied by its neck to one of the columns, licks its paw, while a peacock scours the ground for food nearby. He didn‘t paint the scenes in chronological order and probably worked on this one last. It is the most sophisticated in its planning and bolder in its execution. Our artist seems to have drawn inspiration from the works made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q12-0001-0000-0000.htm">Signorelli</a> for Sienese patrons, as he was working in the city at around the same time. Signorelli was interested in perspective; our painter drew a perspectival grid on the panel – still faintly visible on the pavement – so that he could position each figure and object in perfect relation to the others, giving the scene a sense of three-dimensionality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figures, too, are drawn differently to those in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reunion</a></span>, the first panel the artist painted. They are more varied and flexible – there’s a sense of movement in the Marquis’ stride at the annulment ceremony, and the figure with his back to us in the left foreground artfully balances his weight on one leg, causing his left hip to dip. His pose recalls that of one of the figures in Signorelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Bichi Altarpiece</span> (Toledo Museum of Art, Ohio). Some elements, like the shading of the robes – for example, in the central figures of the Marquis and Griselda – also resemble Signorelli’s style. The draperies in general are less decorative and more natural than those in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F42-0001-0000-0000.htm">Reunion</a></span>; another nod to Signorelli’s simple but bold style.</p></div>

After pretending to annul their marriage and sending Griselda back to her parents‘ house, the Marquis, in his final act of cruelty, tells that he was to marry again, and asks her to arrange the wedding festivities. Remarkably, she obeys: we see her at the far left of the panel, sweeping the floor.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The elaborate wedding procession coming down the hillside includes camels, as well as horses draped in fine fabrics. At the far right of the panel we see Griselda greet a woman with long fair hair and a red gown. Unknown to Griselda, this is her daughter. In a former test, the Marquis had claimed that his and Griselda’s children were killed during infancy; now he pretends that his daughter is to be his wife. Eventually, the Marquis reveals his tests and is reunited with Griselda; her faithfulness has renewed his love for her and the celebration becomes their own. Her loyalty throughout her ordeal earned her fame and respect and she became a model of wifely virtue.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panels were commissioned for a room in the Spanocchi family palace in Siena; they were probably made to celebrate a marriage which took place in January 1494. It is possible they weren’t all ready at the time of the wedding celebrations but this one – the story’s happy ending – might have been made first, just in time for the festivities. Its style is quite different from the others, especially <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Exile</a></span>, the last panel made.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is most evident if we compare the draperies here, for example of the woman in red to the far left, with those in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Exile</a></span>. The edges of her gown seem to billow up as though blown by a strong breeze, a decorative effect that does not appear in the other panels, where the draperies are simpler and follow the forms of the figures more closely. Here, the figures are also quite stiff, with straight, upright backs; in the panels illustrating <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FC5-0001-0000-0000.htm"> the couple’s marriage</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Griselda’s exile</a> the bodies appear natural and flexible.</p></div>

You can still see part of the body of the devil here: his long, curved horn is hooked over Michael’s foot, his black wing against his shield. The rest was lost when the panel was cut down in the eighteenth century, but a painted copy, made before this, records its original appearance. Perugino planned the armour in a detailed drawing, now in the Royal Library, Windsor: it is almost identical to the final painted version, down to the strap which ties the breastplate to the tunic. The drawing is highlighted with strokes of white paint to indicate the areas that reflect the light, showing just how concerned Perugino was with getting the texture of the armour right. Michael’s pose may be inspired by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello’s</a> sculpture of the youthful Saint George, made for the church of the Orsanmichele in Florence (Museo del Bargello, Florence). The sculpture, which Perugino would certainly have known, shows the saint as a boy and a hero who is like Michael, both gentle and strong.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Later in the eighteenth century, after it had already been reduced in size, the painting was cut in half and the upper half was cut at each edge, reducing the size of the wings; we don't know why. The two halves were reunited before the picture entered our collection, through the fragments of the wings were never recovered. By that time they had been replaced, so the outer edges of the wings that we see today are not original.</p></div>

Raphael was sent to accompany the boy, disguising himself as one of his relatives. An expansive landscape was an appropriate background to the subject, and here it is a continuation of that in <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FBI-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with an Angel</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F89-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Archangel Michael</a></span>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tobias holds a freshly caught and gutted fish: Raphael had instructed him to keep its heart, liver and gall. According to the text, Raphael explained that these could be used as an ointment to cure blindness and burnt to drive away evil spirits. He holds the precious organs in a little box. The pair were joined in their travels by Tobias’s dog. We can only see its head at the bottom of the panel, as the lower edge – like that of the other panels– was cut down in the eighteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a> was well known for his ’sweet‘ style, which is particularly apparent here in the look Tobias and Raphael share and in the way they tenderly grip each others’ fingers. He planned their poses in a drawing from life (using workshop assistants) now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. The fish is painted with great skill – Perugino has taken particular care to show the faceted structure of the gill, and the sheen of its finely freckled silvery scales. As in the other panels, this naturalistic effect is achieved through his expert blending of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil paint</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Unlike <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PXJ-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Verrocchio</a>’s version of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D9H-0001-0000-0000.htm">same subject</a>, Perugino’s picture does not show the figures wearing the latest fashions – the emphasis is on Raphael’s protection of the boy. This is because the panel was made to celebrate Raphael, who takes his place in the altarpiece along with his fellow archangels: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F89-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michael</a> on the left panel in the same tier and – Gabriel in the upper tier (now in the Musée d‘Art et d’Histoire, Geneva).</p></div>

He is supported by an angel who looks towards Mary, sharing in her knowledge of his divinity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin’s pinkish-red garment stands out against the blues and greens of the lush Italian countryside. This landscape contains all the features favoured by fifteenth-century painters: a river winds through the valley and past a small town, towards distant mountains. The further back we go, the more blue the mountains appear – a trick to make them seem like they are miles away. This technique, known as aerial perspective and invented by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>, mimics how our perception of colour changes with distance, creating the effect of a vast landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is the central panel of the lower tier of an <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> made for the Duke of Milan (the two flanking panels, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F89-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Archangel Michael</a></span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F7Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Archangel Raphael with Tobias</a></span>, are also in our collection). It shows off Perugino’s skill at <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">painting in oil</a>, blending colours to create subtle transitions between tones. This was particularly effective in the Virgin’s complexion, which is made up of many different shades of peach, cream and pink. With oil paint, features could be defined through the use of lighter and darker shades, eliminating the need for contour lines. When dark lines are used, they have added emphasis: the strongest accents in the painting of the Virgin’s face are the black lines that define the bottom of her upper eyelids, adding weight to her humble downward gaze as she worships Christ, her infant son.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, and by comparing it with the final painted image we can see that Perugino changed his mind several times. The hovering winged angels at the top of the image, for example, were not part of the original design, and have been painted over the sky – usually painters in the period would paint landscape and sky around figures. Infrared reflectography shows that their outlines are made up of dotted lines, suggesting that the design was transferred from paper: pin pricks would be made along the lines of a paper design, then charcoal dust would be rubbed through and onto the panel.</p></div>

Christ is set against a dark background and his face is strongly illuminated – visual devices usually reserved for portraits (see, for example, Antonello da Messina’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>). They intensify the focus on Christ’s expression and heighten both the drama and the intimacy of the interaction between Christ and the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The ambiguity of Christ’s expression – neither anguished, nor pleading – is both unnerving and challenging. He is depicted as courageous and resigned to his fate, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, which Christians believe saved humankind from sin.

His wife Penelope, famous for her fidelity, is shown at her loom: during Odysseus’ 20-year absence she was pursued by other men – seen here queuing up for her attention – but vowed that she would only remarry once her weaving was complete. She ensured that it never was by unpicking her daily labour each night. The central figure who raises his finger seems to be talking to Penelope (he has sometimes been identified as her son Telemachus). He and the suitors wear colourful clothes that look expensive; some have fashionable blond curls and one poses nonchalantly with a falcon, perhaps to show off his hunting skills.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The man entering the room looks different to the other suitors. He carries a staff, often a symbol of a traveller, and his red and blue outfit mirrors the colours of the bow and arrows which hang above Penelope’s head. The association is most likely deliberate: Homer tells us that when Odysseus returned he disguised himself as a beggar and, taking his rivals by surprise, drew his bow and arrows and killed them one by one.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Other episodes in the poem are depicted in the distance. We see Odysseus’ ship, which is decorated with the blue and gold Petrucci coat of arms. The mermaids in the water are the sirens. Homer describes how Odysseus asked his sailors to strap him to the mast as they passed by so that he could listen to their enchanting song without falling victim to its curse – it famously lured sailors to wreck their boats. Sailors in a small boat nearby dive into the water, maddened by the beauty of the singing. On the coast we see Odysseus meeting the witch Circe. They are surrounded by pigs, painted to look like the local Sienese breed, the Cinta Senese, which have a white stripe down their backs. The pigs are in fact humans who have been transformed by Circe’s sorcery.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The choice of subject was relevant for the celebration of a marriage: fidelity and chastity were key virtues for Renaissance women and Penelope was the exemplary bride. It probably had meaning for Pandolfo too, for other reasons: like Odysseus, he also experienced exile and homecoming, having been banished from his hometown of Siena, accused of political intrigue, in the late 1490s.</p></div>

When she would not give up her faith, Emperor Maxentius ordered that she be bound to a spiked wheel and tortured to death. However, a thunderbolt destroyed the wheel before it could harm her.

When she would not give up her faith, Emperor Maxentius ordered that she be bound to a spiked wheel and tortured to death. However, a thunderbolt destroyed the wheel before it could harm her. Catherine was then beheaded.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">She is depicted here in a peaceful rural landscape leaning on the spiked wheel but without her usual attributes of a martyr’s palm and the sword. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> has focused instead on the visionary aspect of her faith, capturing her with her hand on heart and her lips parted, in a moment of divine ecstasy looking heavenwards to a golden break in the clouds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the foreground he has painted a few delicate plants among the rocks, including a dandelion seed head. The dandelion is a bitter herb that appears in Netherlandish and German paintings of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> and was symbolic of Christian grief and in particular Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>. Raphael also included a dandelion clock in his slightly earlier <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family with a Palm Tree</span> (Scottish National Gallery, Edinburgh) and his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baglioni Entombment</span> of 1507 (S. Francesco al Prato, Perugia).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael’s bold presentation of the saint in ecstasy developed out of conventions previously adopted for single figures of saints for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptychs</a> (multi-panelled altarpieces). Raphael probably worked alongside <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>, whose religious figures – frequently with upturned heads and raised eyes – were praised by contemporaries for their angelic air. Perugino also placed his figures against distant landscapes and included still-life details of flowers. However, Saint Catherine’s pose is far more dynamic than anything found in Perugino’s works, revealing the influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>’s and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>’s approaches to the figure.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Catherine’s beautiful curving <span class="dokuwiki_italic">contrapposto</span> pose – reminiscent of a classical statue of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EH0-0008-0000-0000.htm">Venus</a> (and also seen in Botticelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Birth of Venus</span>, Uffizi, Florence) – is partly derived from Leonardo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Leda</span> (Royal Collection, London), which Raphael had copied not long before painting his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Catherine</span>. The spiralling arrangement of her hair and the yellow lining of her mantle are also characteristic of Leonardo’s approach.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sense of sculptural monumentality and the foreshortening of Saint Catherine’s raised head almost certainly derive from Michelangelo’s unfinished marble <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Matthew</span> (1505–6) for the interior of Florence Cathedral (now Accademia, Florence). Raphael made a drawing of it for the bearers in his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baglioni Entombment</span>. Raphael’s figure of Saint Catherine is really a fusion of these two sources – Leonardo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Leda</span> and Michelangelo’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Matthew</span> – but made very much his own, and reflecting the ideal of universal harmony that was so fundamental to his works.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is not known who commissioned Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Catherine</span> – it may have been intended as a picture for private devotion, perhaps for someone particularly devoted to the saint or named after her. Painted in about 1507 when Raphael was working on the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Baglioni Entombment</span>, this picture may also have had a Perugian or Florentine patron. The writer Pietro Aretino considered presenting a picture in his possession ‘in which is the image of the figure of Saint Catherine, by Raphael of Urbino’ to Catherine de' <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>, Queen of France. However, it is impossible to tell whether this is the painting once owned by Aretino and recorded in his possession in 1550.</p></div>

It was usual for the predella to depict narrative scenes of the lives of the saints and holy figures featured in the main panel above.

The scenes were most likely painted on a single horizontal plank of wood, after the predella was already framed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here John the Baptist appears as the forerunner of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, standing on a hillock preaching to a crowd of men (Luke 3: 1–17). He can be identified by his traditional camel-skin costume, which he wears beneath a billowing red mantle, and by the thin reed cross held in his left hand. He points towards heaven, referring to the coming of Christ. When the altarpiece was intact, he would also have been pointing to the identically dressed Baptist in the main panel above, who points towards the infant Christ.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The main focus of the scene is on the crowd and their varying reactions to John the Baptist’s message. His audience is arranged into four groups, differentiated not only by their varied poses but also by their different costumes and expressions. Raphael has used a wide range of clear bright colours, disposed in a lively rhythm across the panel. No single figure wears the same combination of colours. The shapes of the hats are also particularly varied, enhancing the individuality of the figures. The man in purple in the front row listens with rapt attention whereas the fat man in yellow at the back sticks his thumb in his belt and turns with his hand on his hip to his companion with an expression of scepticism. The range of characterisation suggests that Raphael had seen the lively crowd scenes in the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJ5-0008-0000-0000.htm">prints</a> of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Schongauer</a>. The two babies on the rock in the front row of the crowd recall the infant Christ and John the Baptist from other images, such as Raphael’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FN9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Garvagh Madonna</a></span>. One baby clings to his father’s leg in fear at the Baptist’s predictions while the other reaches out to support and comfort him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael’s sketches in black chalk for some of the figures in the crowd appear on a sheet of drawings now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that the final design for the painting was transferred to the panel from a pricked <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartoon</a>. An inventory of 1771 from the Palazzo Ansidei refers to a similar sized drawing of the same subject, suggesting that the cartoon may have remained in the family’s possession, although its whereabouts is unknown today.</p></div>

A small book is open on her knee and she follows the text she is reading with her finger. She draws her baby’s attention to a passage in the book, presumably containing allusions to his future sacrifice. A string of coral beads ending in jewelled crosses is suspended from the throne and resembles a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERT-0008-0000-0000.htm">rosary</a>, a reminder of the blood Christ will shed at the Crucifixion.

The older, more contemplative <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Nicholas</a>, identified by his bishop’s mitre and crosier, withdraws slightly behind the throne. His furrowed brow indicates that he is concentrating on his book. At his feet are three golden balls which represent the purses of gold he gave as dowries to the three daughters of an impoverished nobleman to save them from prostitution. This type of composition, with saints flanking the enthroned Virgin and Child in a unified image, is known as a <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FXQ-0008-0000-0000.htm">sacra conversazione</a></span> (’sacred conversation').</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The lower horizontal panel, known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a>, beneath the main panel of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> probably depicted two scenes: <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist Preaching</a></span> and another scene showing a posthumous miracle of Saint Nicholas. Each narrative scene would have been positioned beneath the saint in the main panel to whom it related.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael carefully calculated the geometry of the composition, dividing it horizontally and vertically into harmonious thirds. The picture surface was incised with a grid nine squares wide by six squares high. This suggests that Raphael worked out his scheme in squared composition drawings on paper and then transferred the design to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> before he began painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Technical investigation has revealed that the pale grey architecture and vaulting behind the Virgin’s throne, which provides a sacred space for the figures, was not planned by Raphael from the beginning but was painted over the sky and landscape. Raphael used the pre-existing grid to position the parapet a third of the way up and the mouldings two-thirds of the way up the panel. This explains why this late addition appears so integral to the composition. He may have decided to include the barrel-vaulted architecture in the altarpiece to compensate for the plainness of the Ansidei Chapel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ansidei Madonna</span> is the grandest and most successfully designed of Raphael’s early Madonnas. The painting is closest in style and form to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Colonna Altarpiece</span> (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York), which gives an idea of how the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Ansidei Madonna</span> would have appeared before Raphael added the architectural backdrop.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This altarpiece, one of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a>’s earliest works, is known as the ‘<span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mond Crucifixion</span>’ after Dr Ludwig Mond (1839–1909) who bequeathed it to the National Gallery in 1924. It was commissioned by the wool merchant and banker Domenico Gavari for his burial chapel in the church of S. Domenico in Città di Castello, Umbria.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael produced his earliest documented works in Umbria – three altarpieces and a banner for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FPZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">confraternity</a> – it is likely he was living in Perugia at the time. This is the second of the altarpieces he painted. The Latin inscription on the stone frame, which is still in the church, translates as ‘Domenico di Tommaso Gavari had this work made 1503’. Gavari was a close friend of Andrea Baronci, for whom Raphael painted the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Nicholas of Tolentino Altarpiece</span> for the church of S. Agostino, also in Città di Castello. Raphael probably received the commission through this connection. When Baronci’s widow made Gavari her heir in 1512, her will was witnessed in front of Raphael’s ‘altar of the Crucifix’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s body hangs from the Cross, which is surmounted with the inscription ‘I.N.R.I.’, which stands for <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum</span> (‘Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews’). Two angels with scrolling ribbons at their waists balance on delicate slivers of cloud on either side of Christ. They catch the blood flowing from his wounds in golden chalices reminiscent of those in which wine would be served during Mass at the altar below. The promise of resurrection offered through the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a> was an appropriate subject for a funerary chapel where Mass would have been said for Gavari’s soul. The inclusion of the chalices is also fitting as Gavari left money in his early wills to furnish every chapel he endowed with new chalices.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Cross, on the brown foreground, is set against a view of the Umbrian landscape with Città di Castello in the distance. The sun and moon are both visible in the sky, marking the eclipse that coincided with Christ’s death. Raphael used silver leaf for the moon and gold leaf for the sun. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a> are at the foot of the Cross. gazing up at Christ’s body with reverence and pity, providing an example for the worshippers at the altar. A drawing that seems to be a study for the figure of Mary Magdalene is now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin Mary</a>, dressed in purplish black to denote mourning, stands to the left of the Cross and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Evangelist</a> stands to the right. They both look towards the viewer and wring their hands in grief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome was not present at the Crucifixion but is included in this scene because the chapel was dedicated to him. He gestures to the Cross and holds the stone with which he beat his breast while living as a hermit in the wilderness. The miracles that happened after Christ’s death were painted in scenes of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> (the lower painted panel displayed beneath the main panel of the altarpiece). Two predella panels survive in the North Carolina Museum of Art, Raleigh, and the Museu Nacional de Arte Antigua, Lisbon. Originally there was probably at least one additional panel. Gavari himself may have chosen to dedicate the altar to Saint Jerome as he also named his first-born son Girolamo (Jerome in Italian).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The altarpiece is strongly influenced by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a>, the leading artist in central Italy at the time, with whom Raphael developed a close artistic relationship while living in Perugia. The overall design is based on several versions of the crucified Christ in a landscape painted by Perugino in the late 1480s and 1490s, and is especially similar to his altarpiece of the Crucifixion for the convent of S. Francesco al Monte in Perugia, commissioned 1502 and completed 1506. In that painting angels with fluttering ribbons hold chalices to catch the blood from Christ’s wounds, the Virgin and the Evangelist are almost identical to Raphael’s and Mary Magdalene is in the same pose in reverse on the other side of the Cross. It’s likely that Raphael saw Perugino’s works in his workshop in Perugia before they were unveiled. As well as adopting the sweet, small-featured oval faces and stylised hand gestures of Perugino’s figures, Raphael took the principles of symmetry, harmony and clarity of composition from Perugino’s works. However, Raphael adapted these, giving them greater softness and sophistication. Here, however, it is not entirely clear who copied whose work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Raphael’s early works he usually based his compositions on a simple geometric grid, which he incised on the panel to help him transfer his drawing, as we can see in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FJS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Ansidei Madonna</a></span>. No grid is visible in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Mond Crucifixion</span>, although the strong symmetry and geometrical structure of the picture suggest that Raphael may have used a similar method initially to set out his composition. He used a ruler and compass to incise the outline of the Crucifix, and compasses to incise the sun and moon. The way he left unpainted spaces for the figures and made no revisions or changes while painting suggests that he was working from a carefully prepared design in a detailed drawing. During this period Raphael frequently used dark hatched brushstrokes to reinforce areas of shadow – a technique derived from Perugino – which is particularly noticeable here in the draperies. Raphael also used his hands and fingers to blot and model the wet surface paint. His fingerprints and palm prints are visible in the shadows of the heads, especially in Christ’s hair, face and beard.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael scratched through the brown paint at the foot of the Cross to a layer of silver leaf beneath to sign the painting: RAPHAEL / VRBIN / AS / .P.[INXIT] (‘Raphael of Urbino painted this’). <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a> famously commented that if Raphael had not signed the painting, no one would have believed that he and not Perugino had painted it.</p></div>

The main panel of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWR-0008-0000-0000.htm">altarpiece</a> depicted the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin and Child enthroned</a> with saints (Peter, Paul, Catherine and another female martyr). At the top of the altarpiece was a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F5X-0008-0000-0000.htm">lunette</a> showing God the Father blessing, flanked by two angels with scrolling ribbons similar to those in Raphael’s earlier <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECO-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mond Crucifixion</a></span>.

The three distinct groups of the procession are linked together by a pattern of repeated colour and by the figures who look back over their shoulders at the groups behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We can see Raphael’s interest in the work of other artists in this small panel. The turbaned horseman and rearing white horse behind him reveal his knowledge of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>’s unfinished <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a>, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Battle of Anghiari</span>, after which he had made a sketch (Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). The procession with all its diversity may indicate Raphael’s knowledge of an engraving of the same subject by the German artist <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0L-0001-0000-0000.htm">Martin Schongauer</a>. Another predella panel by Raphael, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist Preaching</a></span>, takes further the variety of costume and colour, and emphasis on rhythm and pattern, to add structure and interest to a crowd scene. The group of the Virgin supported by the Three Marys was inspired by figures in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EF5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Deposition</a> scene for the high altar of SS. Annunziata, Florence, begun by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q79-0001-0000-0000.htm">Filippino Lippi</a> and completed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PWX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Perugino</a> after Filippino’s death in 1504.

The scenes were originally painted on a single plank of wood that was cut into three when the predella was sold. Two smaller panels showing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> saints completed the predella.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although some have since criticised the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Colonna Altarpiece</span> as an awkward blend of styles and influences, at the time of its making it received the highest praise. The predella scenes demonstrate Raphael’s growing talent for narrative and for drawing out a poignant human dimension in biblical stories.</p></div>

Once a high-ranking Roman general, he was banished from the city in 491 BC, taking refuge with the neighbouring Volsci. This picture shows him back in Rome after leading the Volscian army to victory against the city; his soldiers have pitched their camp on the banks of the river Tiber in the distance. Hearing of his role in the battle, his mother Volumnia and his wife Vergilia – shown here holding their baby, who tucks his hand into her dress – led a deputation of women to beg for his mercy and to spare the city. Plutarch, one of several Roman authors to write about this event, describes how Volumnia made a speech that convinced Coriolanus to withdraw the Volscian troops. In honour of their bravery, the Romans built a new temple dedicated to Women’s Fortune.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Coriolanus was faced with choosing between his family and his new allegiance to the Volsci, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q12-0001-0000-0000.htm">Signorelli</a> has made his emotion at the sight of his family clear. His arms are open, ready to embrace his elder child, the exuberant little boy who hurtles towards him while casting an anxious glance back towards his grandmother. This touching detail invites the viewer to identify with Coriolanus' dilemma.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Signorelli has made great efforts to make the figures look like ancient Romans. The elaborate draperies and the gilded armour are imaginative impressions of classical-style dress; the laurel wreath Coriolanus wears around his head is a reference to the wreath of victory worn by conquering heroes. Even his children, with their playful gestures and poses, recall the carvings found on ancient Roman sarcophagi (stone coffins).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The patron, Pandolfo Petrucci, may have identified with such a scene: he was banished from Siena briefly in the 1490s and went into self-imposed exile in 1503, only one year before he acquired the buildings that he would transform into his palace.</p></div>

She is Laura, the hero of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Triumph of Chastity</span>, a poem by the fourteenth-century Italian poet <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ED6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Petrarch</a>. For Petrarch, Laura was the model of female beauty and virtue; she exemplified the power of Chastity to conquer the wild lust of erotic love. Chastity was essential within marriage – the cornerstone of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> society – which explains why this story was included in the cycle of frescoes. The fresco is dominated by blue and gold, the colours of the Petrucci coat of arms.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The action takes place in a hilly landscape just outside a fortified town. On the far left, Love is pursued by a group of women whose speed is echoed in the draperies of their classical-style dresses, which blow in the breeze behind them. Two of them have caught him; one grabs him at the waist while the other tackles him at the knee. In the foreground they deliver him to Laura, the woman in the white dress with plaited hair, who ties him up in thick ropes. Love kneels, now helpless, craning his neck to get a better view of his captor. Penelope (who features in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">one of the frescoes</a>) and Lucretia, famously faithful women of ancient Greek literature and Roman history respectively, break his bow and arrow and pluck the feathers from his wings, preventing him from causing further harm. A green banner decorated with an ermine – a symbol of moral purity on account of its pure white coat – flutters above them. Two Roman soldiers – one of whom may be Scipio, mentioned in Petrarch’s text – look on as they work. Finally, on the right, Love – bound, wings now bare – is paraded in a chariot driven by Chastity herself; a band of women follow behind.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The figures‘ dramatic gestures are strengthened by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q12-0001-0000-0000.htm">Signorelli</a>’s skill in life drawing and his accurate depiction of human anatomy. This is especially evident in the naked figure of Love, whose muscular chest and abdomen are well-defined, but even the women’s legs, waists and shoulders are articulated, rather than hidden, by their bulky draperies. Signorelli signed the unfurled scroll beneath Love’s bent knee; ’Coritius‘ means ’from the town of Cortona', where the artist was born.</p></div>

This movement, which started in the Low Countries, emphasised the need for medieval Christians to meditate on Christ’s suffering. The small scale of this picture and its pendant, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FC2-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ at Gethsemane</a></span>, tell us that they were made for use in an intimate space for private contemplation and personal devotion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Several nineteenth-century sources describe <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Christ Carrying the Cross</span> as having come from Palazzo Medici-Riccardi in Florence. A note in the 1862 catalogue of the Duke of Sutherland’s collection at Stafford House, London, states that the painting was made for the private chapel of Cardinal Giovanni de’ Medici (1475–1521) in Florence. Giovanni, the second son of the celebrated patron of the arts Lorenzo de’ Medici, later become Pope Leo X. A connection with the illustrious <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Medici family</a> may explain the painting’s high quality and miniaturist sophistication.</p></div>

It is based largely on Perugino’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Agony in the Garden</span> (Uffizi, Florence), which was painted in Florence in the 1490s, although our painting’s composition is less geometrically controlled and the relative scale of some figures is unconvincing: Christ is too large compared to the apostles and the main group no longer form an approximately equilateral triangle. Individual figures derive from other works by Perugino – the apostle on the right seems to be taken from his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Transfiguration</span> (Pinacoteca Vaticana, Rome), while the one opposite him is essentially the same figure rotated 90 degrees to achieve a balanced pair.
