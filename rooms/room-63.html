        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ blesses the viewer with his right hand. Antonello has altered the original position of the fingers and hand, foreshortening them – that is, compressing their real length – so that they appear to be projecting out of the picture.  If you look closely, you can see the outlines of their initial position, now visible because the paint has thinned over time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of image of Christ is based upon Netherlandish pictures that became popular as focuses for prayer in the fifteenth century. The head-on view is based upon the imprint of Christ’s face which, according to legend, he left on the handkerchief of Saint Veronica as he approached the site of the Crucifixion. Antonello uses layers of oil paint glazes to show a range of textures, painting Christ’s image as vividly as if it were a portrait.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Long curly hair, a blue mantle and a gesture of blessing are the only indications that this is an image of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>. This type of close-up ‘portrait’ of Christ, which originated in Flanders in the fifteenth century, was a popular image used to aid prayer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Such pictures derived from the legend of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D22-0001-0000-0000.htm">Saint Veronica</a> who offered her handkerchief to Christ to wipe his face as he walked to the site of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. According to the legend, the cloth was miraculously marked with a permanent impression of Christ’s features and so became the only true image of Christ. A relic of the handkerchief was said to be preserved in Saint Peter’s Basilica in Rome. Paintings depicting the so-called true portrait developed into a variety of images of Christ’s face including that of Christ making this blessing gesture. All have a head-on viewpoint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The half-length image of Christ Blessing probably derives from a painting by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q8O-0001-0000-0000.htm">Rogier van der Weyden</a> – the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Braque Triptych</span> in the Louvre, Paris – which also features the Virgin Mary and Saint John the Baptist. The image of Christ in that painting was copied by numerous Netherlandish artists and these kinds of pictures soon became popular in Italy. Most versions include a halo and an inscription of Christ’s name. Antonello has removed these elements so that Christ’s divinity is evident only through his face, which resembles the other images, and blessing gesture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Over time the layers of paint have thinned so that the drawing beneath is visible in places – the outer edge of Christ’s right nostril, for example, and we can also see short parallel lines on the bridge of the nose that indicate an area of shadow. If you look just above Christ’s raised hand, you’ll see the outline of its position in the initial design. Antonello changed it to make Christ’s presence more immediate, altering the alignment of his fingers so that they look as though they are stacked on top of each other, and moving them towards the viewer so that his hand appears to jut out over the parapet into our space. The original design follows versions of the image by the Netherlandish painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QEP-0001-0000-0000.htm">Hans Memling</a>, now in the Norton Simon Museum, Pasadena.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello used walnut oil to bind his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a>, enabling him to show the sheen of Christ’s curls, for example, as well as the subtle variations of colour that create the illusion of marble in the parapet. This image shows Antonello’s interest in using paint to describe different textures such as the stark pink flesh of Christ’s lower eyelid and the crisp folds of the paper (called a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cartellino</span>) attached to the parapet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cartellino</span> bears the artist’s signature and the date, written in Latin. The inscription, translated, reads: ‘In the year 1465 of the eighth indiction Antonello da Messina painted me.’ The inscription has caused confusion not least because the skilful technique used here suggests the picture could have been painted in the 1470s at around the same time as his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>.</p></div>

A trickle of congealing blood seeps from the wound at his right rib. Just beyond the Cross, in the distance, we can see the figures of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EUN-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Marys</a>, Christ’s female followers, on their way home, leaving only the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Evangelist</a> to support Christ in his final moments.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary – whose figure is the best preserved part of the picture, the surface of which is badly abraded (rubbed) – kneels before the Cross. Resting her hands on her knees, palms down and eyes closed, her whole body seems to be sinking into the ground: she is heavy with grief, absorbed in her pain. John, on the other hand, looks up at Christ, his arms outstretched in frustration or disbelief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s body is set against the backdrop of the sky; he no longer occupies the same physical terrain as Mary and John. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello</a> has composed the picture with a low viewpoint so that we feel as though we are looking up at Christ, in the same way we might look up at a Crucifix placed upon an altar. This association is a reminder that Christ’s death was, for Christians, part of God’s plan, and that it would come to be celebrated by the Christian Church as an act of salvation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When this picture was acquired by the National Gallery in 1884 it was framed in the shape of a narrow arch – a section had been added to the top and the upper corners had been removed. It was immediately restored to its original rectangular shape – the shape of the artist’s other Crucifixions – and the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPS-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartellino</a></span> inscribed with Antonello’s signature and the date he made the painting, once on the reverse of the panel, was moved to the bottom of the picture and protected by two strips of wood on either side, added at the same time.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It was not unusual for Antonello to sign and date his pictures in this way (see for example his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FGX-0001-0000-0000.htm">Christ Blessing</a></span>). Like that picture, the date of this one is debated. The first three numbers of the date are legible as ‘147’, but the final number is too damaged to read. We now think the picture was made in 1475, the same year that Antonello painted a larger version of the subject (Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Antwerp picture – which also includes the two thieves who were crucified alongside Christ – bears a strong resemblance to <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a>’s version now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Both scenes include lots of details taken from the biblical accounts of the Crucifixion, emphasising the very public nature of this kind of execution. Our picture owes some debt to Netherlandish versions of the subject by van Eyck and other painters, which were usually also painted on a small scale, with Christ’s slender body isolated high above the figures below and in front of broad landscape background. Antonello has simplified his composition to aid meditation upon Christ’s sacrifice and suffering.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Born in the fourth century, Saint Jerome was a scholar and a monk. His translation of the Bible from Greek into Latin is known as the Vulgate, and it is still used by the Catholic Church today.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello offers a peek into the saint’s environment through a fictive stone wall pierced by a broad archway; it’s as though we're looking into a doll’s house.

An array of miniature still lifes – including books, a ceramic vase and a jar – line the study’s shelves.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist’s skill in using oil paint enabled him to recreate the texture of these objects, whether rough or shiny, cold or warm. This technical ability, inspired by his study of Netherlandish art, was hugely influential for the artists of Venice, where Antonello made this painting.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello</a> painted his image of Saint Jerome when he was at the height of his technical and artistic ability. Paying homage to Netherlandish painters of the fifteenth century, he has constructed a broad, multi-layered stage set for the saint to inhabit, bursting with props. Every detail is painted with precision, his skill in the oil painting technique enabling him to imitate a range of textures and finishes.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Born in the fourth century, Jerome had an excellent education in theology and classical literature in Rome before leaving the city to escape its many temptations and travelling to Bethlehem. He lived in the desert surrounding the city for some time, famously befriending a lion, and later established a monastery where he began his work of translating the Bible from Greek into Latin. His translation, which provided non Greek-speakers with access to the holy text, is known as the Vulgate and is still used  by the Catholic Church today. He is usually shown dressed as a cardinal in long red robes and a wide-brimmed hat in honour of his status and importance in the Catholic Church.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This picture was most probably made for an important patron whom Antonello was keen to impress – and to delight. He thought carefully about the way they would have engaged with the picture, as well as the subject matter itself: a fictive stone wall, pierced by a broad archway, creates a solitary space for Jerome to study while simultaneously inviting the viewer to peek into his environment, as though looking into a doll’s house. A ledge separates the viewer from the saint and his domain, providing a visible boundary between the real and the painted world. It is guarded by two birds: a partridge, which symbolises truth – it was thought that a partridge always recognised its mother’s call – and a peacock, symbolising immortality – their flesh was thought never to decay.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jerome’s study is at the heart of a lofty, cathedral-like space beneath a high vaulted ceiling. The austere, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4S-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gothic</a>, ecclesiastical setting with its slender columns and arches, which might be intended to represent the saint’s monastery, is enlivened by the colourful floor tiles.  The saint’s lion companion stalks down the aisle, and through the panes of the square windows we see a sunlit pastoral landscape. Jerome sits at his desk on a rounded chair called a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">cathedra</span>; normally reserved for high-ranking clerics, usually bishops, it reinforces his status. The study resembles a modern purpose-built office with built-in shelves and desk, and the whole structure is raised up on a platform accessible by a small flight of integrated steps. We know that this kind of study actually existed in the fifteenth century; the description of Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de‘ <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0TTB-0001-0000-0000.htm">Medici</a>’s study in the inventory of 1498 is strikingly similar: ’a large writing desk … with boards and a backrest, and with a cupboard with a cornice made of walnut, and compartments decorated with inlay. Underneath the desk, where one puts one’s feet, is a wooden platform raised up from the ground.'</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The study’s shelves are lined with Jerome’s worldly possessions – an array of miniature still lifes including books, both open and closed, a ceramic vase and a jar. A <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6A-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifix</a> hangs above his desk. Antonello’s careful imitation of the texture of their surfaces, whether rough or shiny, cold or warm, recalls Jan van Eyck’s approach to painting the objects in his portrait of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0D8P-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Arnolfini and his wife</a>. There was a painting of Saint Jerome in his study by van Eyck in Naples, where Antonello worked for a period in 1456. It is possible that he saw it there.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Venetian writer Marcantonio Michiel, who saw <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Saint Jerome in his Study</span> in Venice, described it in 1519 as a work by van Eyck.  Although it is now recognised as one of Antonello’s finest works, made during his time in Venice in the 1470s, Michiel’s mistake is understandable. In fact, Antonello was so skilled that it was once thought that he learnt to paint in oil from van Eyck himself, although we now know this is very improbable. Van Eyck was just one of many Netherlandish painters Antonello was able to study at first-hand when he was in Venice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture shares other traits with Netherlandish painting – the setting of a Gothic cathedral-type architecture was popular with Netherlandish painters, as was the landscape viewed through a window or opening. Both are found, for example, in van Eyck’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"> Virgin of Chancellor Rolin</span> (Louvre, Paris) as well as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0HOI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donne Triptych</a> by Hans Memling.</p></div>

The armless, half-length representation recalls classical marble busts of emperors. Often placed on plinths – recalled here by the parapet – these were adopted in the Renaissance period for sculpted portraits of the powerful and wealthy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Bellini no doubt wanted to make this visual connection, but here he shows how he can surpass sculptural portraits through his mastery of oil paint. The subtle blending of colour in this slow-drying medium allowed him to create convincing tonal transitions when painting flesh. Oil paint also lends itself to slightly blurred contours; Loredan’s expression seems changeable, making him appear lifelike and immediate as well as distant and imposing.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Leonardo Loredan knows that he is being looked at, but he does not return our gaze. To do so would be to treat the viewer as an equal – but Loredan is the<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0008-0000-0000.htm"> doge</a>, the ruler of the Venetian Republic, and so no one looking at this picture could have been equal to him. He was elected in 1501 and ruled until his death in 1521.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Loredan appears to be scrutinising something. The intensity of his gaze, which suggests his intelligence, is reinforced by the pale blue of his small, deep-set eyes. This sternness is balanced by the enigmatic expression of his mouth: the slightly deeper crease in the wrinkle to the right of his lips suggests that he is about to break into a wry, one-sided smile – a smirk, maybe. This is counterbalanced again by the light around his left eye, which gives his expression an open sincerity. It’s as though <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> is showing all of the doge’s potential moods and dispositions, his capacity for severity and judgement as well as a sharp wit and openness to the truth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Previously, portraits of Venice’s doges had traditionally followed the normal conventions for portraits of rulers, showing them in strict profile. Bellini has used the more contemporary three-quarter view, popularised in the city by artists like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello da Messina</a> from the 1470s onwards, to explore Loredan’s character. His brother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PAH-0001-0000-0000.htm">Gentile</a> used it too, in his portrait of Doge Agostino Barbarigo (now in a private collection), but it was Giovanni who – in this portrait – fully developed its potential for realism as well as psychological expression.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As in portraits by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">van Eyck</a> and Antonello, Bellini created the illusion that the sitter is lit by a strong light source coming from the left. It allowed him to give shape to the face, and to create the impression of three-dimensionality, by painting any protrusions that catch the glare in lighter shades and the flatter areas in shadow. The effect was enhanced by Bellini’s absolute mastery of painting in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> by this stage in his career. This slow-drying medium enabled him to blend colours together, avoiding harsh transitions and making changes in tone – particularly the flesh tones – appear natural. Subtle shading enabled him to describe the skin’s texture convincingly; the skin of Loredan’s neck is soft and loose and he has very fine wrinkles around his eyes – details that record his age, seen as a crucial component of wisdom.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Loredan is shown in the white robes he would have worn on the most splendid occasions, and the contrast of white and gold against the blue background makes him appear even more striking and dazzling. The gentle curve of the horned <span class="dokuwiki_italic">corno ducale</span> (dogal cap) sweeps upwards gracefully. Several widths of expensive white silk damask fabric, woven with gold and silver metal thread, were sewn together to make the mantle. The pomegranate design came from eastern Mediterranean textiles and was popular in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> fabrics. Loredan himself introduced white dogal robes for the processions celebrating the feasts of Candlemas and the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a>. If you look closely, you‘ll see that the design is upside down; the back – the view most people would see in ceremonial processions – showed the design upright. This kind of detail indicates that Bellini was observing and recording what he saw accurately, rather than imagining it: he probably borrowed the mantle so that he could take his time to paint it.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The blue background was painted using plenty of ultramarine – one of the most costly<a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm"> pigments</a> available – mixed with white. It gives the sense that, while he is separated from us by the marble parapet, the space the doge occupies is infinite. This sense of openness makes it easier to imagine that if it weren’t for the parapet we might actually be able to walk around Loredan, as though he were a sculpture – an effect almost certainly sought by Bellini. The concealed arms and half-length representation recall classical marble busts of emperors; often placed on plinths, recalled here by the parapet, these were adopted during the Renaissance for sculpted portraits of the powerful and wealthy. The deep folds of the mantle and the shadow cast by the ornamental buttons (called <span class="dokuwiki_italic">campanoni d‘oro</span>, ’golden bells‘) give the impression of a stiff, solid form resembling carved stone. But the short strokes of thick paint Bellini used to achieve a slightly rough texture where the light catches the gilt thread woven through the silk remind us that this isn’t a cold stone sculpture after all.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Rather than inscribe his name onto the picture, or paint it as though it was carved into the marble of the parapet, Bellini has made it look like a casual afterthought: his signature appears on a piece of paper that looks as though it has just been unfolded and stuck onto the marble. This is an astonishing act of false modesty, as it shows off Bellini’s skill at painting a range of materials, reinforcing their different textures by painting the one on top of the other.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The council room of the doge’s palace – the seat of government and the dogal residence – was decorated with a frieze of portraits of successive doges, recording their appearance for posterity. From 1474 Gentile Bellini was responsible for these portraits, which were destroyed by fire only one hundred years later. This picture was not part of that series – it was probably painted as a private commission. A poem by Lydio Catti, published in Venice in 1502, mentions Giovanni Bellini as Loredan’s portraitist and proves this was made before 1502.</p></div>

The oval shape made by her hands as she gently presses her fingertips together in prayer echoes the shape of her face and hairline; the angle of her head as she looks down mirrors the curve of her right hand. This subtle tilt to the right is the only thing that disrupts the symmetry of the triangular shape of her body. This imposing shape, made bolder through the startling blue of her robe, creates a sense of serenity and calm; the Virgin’s body is an anchor in the scene.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> was one of the first Italian painters to use natural settings to enhance the meaning of his pictures. Here, the still and silent Virgin contrasts with the landscape to create an image rich in meaning. The varying shapes of the clouds, from thin and wispy to fat and fluffy, and the shadows on them give the impression of changeable weather. The oxen in the smallholding behind are rubbing their heads together; the herder, with his arm behind his back, is pacing the land. To the Virgin’s left, a snake menaces a crane which raises its wings in fright. This detail has been traced to the famous pastoral odes written by the Roman poet, Virgil – a literary allusion incorporated for an educated clientele – and is perhaps a reference to good versus evil (symbolised by the snake). The delicate poplars clothed in miniature lime-green foliage seem to bend in the breeze. Bellini may have been inspired by altarpieces in Venice painted by northern European artists like <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P5V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jan van Eyck</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ0-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dirk Bouts</a>, who had made careful studies of the way light affects how objects – and the natural world –  appear. The clarity of the light, which casts a pale glow on everything it touches, from the Virgin’s right sleeve to the walls of the castle in the distance, suggests it is springtime.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Spring has not yet come to the tree with naked branches where a vulture, a foreboding symbol of death, is perched. The pose of the infant Christ, eyes closed and limbs stretched out, would have reminded contemporary viewers of a type of picture known as the Lamentation, or pietà, which showed Christ after his death lying across his mother’s knees. And yet the carefully observed landscape in our picture evokes hopefulness: spring is a time of renewal in nature and of Easter, the moment of Christ’s resurrection from the dead.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don't know who the picture was made for, but there was strong demand in this period for religious pictures that would provoke an intense emotional and spiritual reaction. Bellini achieves this through a landscape setting which is intended to intensify the viewer’s personal engagement with the holy figures: they are present within a recognisable space and therefore seem more immediate.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ has retreated to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray. He is in agony – he knows that one of his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciples</a>, Judas, has betrayed him and that as a result he will be arrested, tortured and killed. Judas is visible just beyond the river, leading a group of soldiers to Christ. Three other disciples have come to keep watch but have fallen asleep.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As he prays, Christ looks towards a cherub who presents him with a chalice, reflecting how Christ talks about his future suffering in his prayer: ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as thou wilt’ (Matthew 26: 39). The spiked fence post in the foreground – placed directly beneath the chalice – hints at the means of this suffering, bringing to mind the crown of thorns Christ was forced to wear at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. This reference to Christ’s torture links the chalice to the cup which bore the Eucharistic wine – shared by all at Mass and believed to transform into Christ’s blood. The association with contemporary Christian ritual is emphasised by the fact that the improbable rock formation which Christ kneels upon resembles a church altar, where the Mass would be received.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> painted this scene shortly after his brother-in-law, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Mantegna</a>, completed <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSH-0001-0000-0000.htm">his version</a>, as well as a depiction of the scene for the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> of the altarpiece for the church of San Zeno, Verona. Mantegna was based in Padua, near Venice, and it’s likely that Bellini was also working there for a short time in the 1450s. Both artists used a drawing of a similar scene by Bellini’s father, Jacopo, as the inspiration for the altar-like outcrop. As here, Jacopo’s drawing shows Christ facing away from the viewer and towards a distant hillside; Giovanni crowned the hill with an imposing fortress (intended to represent the city of Jerusalem). Giovanni’s version is closer to the drawn scene – both have gently rounded forms and sinuous lines, also found in the large expanses of sandy earth, the swirling dirt tracks and the cliff faces which look as though they have been eroded by desert winds. This bleak, almost lunar, landscape is perhaps intended reflect Christ’s psychological torment.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene shows Bellini experimenting with elements of Mantegna’s style. For example, some of the rock forms in the foreground have straight edges and look, like Mantegna’s, as though they have been carved with a chisel. The draperies, too, resemble Mantegna’s in their crisp sharp folds. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that these two areas were drawn particularly carefully; the draperies are almost certainly based upon very detailed studies. Bellini was clearly taking very great care to emulate his brother-in-law’s style. The use of gold paint, called ’shell gold', painted in fine strokes as highlights on clothing is also drawn from Mantegna. Bellini used it here with great precision to show Christ bathed in the early morning light, but perhaps also to express his divinity. The clearest sign of Bellini’s debt to Mantegna is in his attempt to copy one of the sleeping disciples from <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSH-0001-0000-0000.htm">his version</a>. His foreshortening is not quite as effective as Mantegna’s.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s pink tunic blends with the peach light of the dawn sky, which highlights the undersides of the plump clouds. This soft, warm light gilds the entire scene. Bellini would continue to develop his extraordinary sensitivity for the changing effects of light on landscapes throughout his career.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This scene tells the story of the murder of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EJY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Peter Martyr</a>, a friar of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominican Order</a> who was killed by members of the Cathar sect, whose teachings Peter and others had condemned as heresy. One of his murderers, Carino of Balsamo, later converted and became a Dominican himself. It’s highly unlikely that this was painted as an altarpiece – the narrative has no central focal point and is almost overwhelmed by the landscape setting, and the figures are on a small scale. It might have been painted for a meeting room or the side wall of a chapel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">If we read the picture from the top left, we move from expansive views to minute observations of nature – and to the violent drama of the scene. In the far distance, we see the peaks of a mountain range silhouetted against the light. Closer to us a winding road leads down the hillside to a walled town – complete with fortifications, towers and spires – which dominates the valley. This is probably Verona, where Saint Peter Martyr came from: two of the towers seem to represent the churches of Sant' Anastasia and San Zeno. A herdsman drives his cattle into the town. And in the bottom right corner, a little bird perches on a branch, near a scroll bearing <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a>’s signature.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The main action takes place far away from the serenity and order of the city and normal rural activities. On a dirt track in the forest two Dominican friars – they wear the Order’s black and white habits (uniform) – are pursued and attacked by the Cathar assassins. Saint Peter Martyr is shown on the left. He has collapsed to his knees, an axe lodged in his skull; his killer, Carino, makes the final blow to his chest with a dagger. The violence is screened by a thick copse of trees, and Bellini has placed a woodsman between the two assassins – he strikes at a tree trunk with his axe, emphasising the brutality of the event.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Until recent cleaning and restoration the picture was covered by layers of varnish which had darkened over time, as well as old repainting. The cleaning revealed the cleaver in Saint Peter’s head, a characteristic feature of images of him. Technical analysis also shows that the pose of his killer was altered during painting. The armour and helmet were afterthoughts, and Bellini eventually decided to show him in the act of plunging the dagger into the saint’s heart. The poses of the two pairs of figures are in fact identical to a version of the scene painted in 1509 by an artist close to Bellini (The Courtauld Gallery, London).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cleaning also revealed that the dark tree trunks are interspersed with glimmers of bright summer light. This alternating rhythm of light and dark leads our attention rapidly from left to right, as though we are running alongside Peter’s companion as he flees his attacker. The glimpses of the sunlit pasture beyond might also be a promise of salvation – Peter’s life and his martyrdom for his faith led to him being declared a saint in 1253. By contrasting the claustrophobic enclosed track with the sunny mountains and bright sky, notably placed just above Peter’s head, Bellini seems to offer hope for redemption beyond the struggles of life and death.</p></div>

His body is weak and pale – we can see his ribcage, and his cheekbones stick out of his gaunt face. The wound in Christ’s side is the focus of the image; he presses it, releasing blood into the chalice held by the angel below.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is intended to bring to mind the chalice that holds the wine of the ritual of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5G-0008-0000-0000.htm">Eucharist</a> (which Catholics believe transforms into Christ’s blood). By drinking the wine, Christians believe they will attain eternal life; Christ’s triumph was to achieve eternal life through his suffering. The issue of the sanctity of Christ’s blood was controversial at the time that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Bellini</a> made this picture. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EN9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Dominicans</a> believed that Christ’s blood was divine but the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscans</a> believed that it was Christ’s death, rather than his blood, that had saved humanity. It seems likely, then, that the picture was painted for a Dominican community.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Given its shape, size and subject, it seems probable that the painting decorated the inside of a cupboard known as a tabernacle, which stored the host of the Eucharist – the bread eaten at Mass. In the background of the picture a priest in a blue robe – the kind worn by some Venetian priests – is followed by a young boy in black, perhaps an acolyte. The priest carries a white cloth, perhaps the cloth used to protect the wine of the Eucharist, an appropriate reference considering the picture’s likely location. And this location might explain the painting’s good condition, apart from the area around Christ’s legs. The putty-coloured patches were once blue clouds painted with cherubim and seraphim (red and blue winged angelic beings without bodies) – they have been scratched out but we don't know when or why.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Low stone walls decorated with carvings separate Christ from the landscape. The one on the left shows a pagan sacrifice: the figure in the toga seems to be pouring water on an altar where a fire is burning and where there’s an inscription referring to an ancient rite – the worship of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">manes</span>, ancestor gods. In the other carving, two of the three figures seem to be deep in conversation, an incense burner between them. The seated figure has a long staff called a <span class="dokuwiki_italic">caduceus</span>, which was traditionally carried by the pagan messenger god, Mercury. One of his roles was to accompany the dead to Hades, the underworld. The theme, again, is death. Bellini seems to be contrasting pagan rituals with the Christian rite of the Eucharist, showing how Christianity surpassed pagan religions. The priest and the acolyte in the valley behind reinforce this message. They walk away from the desolate ruins of antiquity and towards the brighter, more orderly town, where the church is the central.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> revealed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, the design that Bellini made on the panel before he began to paint. With the point of a fine brush he made simple lines, but there is considerably more detail in the angel’s drapery, where he used short, closely packed brushstrokes to show the areas of shadow in the folds. Bellini’s earliest works, like this one, are painted in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELI-0008-0000-0000.htm">tempera</a> on wooden panels, though he used both tempera and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FLK-0008-0000-0000.htm">oil</a> in his career. His technique was incredibly precise, particularly when painting details. Usually in tempera paintings we can see individual brushstrokes, but Bellini’s were so delicate that they are imperceptible. This is no surprise – he painted miniatures at the very beginning of his career.</p></div>

He is shown naked, sitting on a cushion upon a table or altar, clenching his little fists as a priest performs the ritual. His mother, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, gently props him up; the old man behind is his father, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An attendant holds back the priest’s robe with a gloved hand, an action mirrored on the right, where a woman pulls up a semi-transparent cloth that covers part of the table. It’s as though they are pulling back stage curtains to reveal the scene’s central drama, the circumcision. The transparent cloth resembles those worn by Christ in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> images of the Virgin and Child, and may be a deliberate reference to them; they were a familiar sight in Venice due to the city’s mercantile connections in the Eastern Mediterranean.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The robes and veils of the figures around Christ have been carefully painted in jewel-like colours using expensive <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigments</a>. The most costly was ultramarine, used for the Virgin’s blue robe, but it has degraded over time. The border of the priest’s cloak is decorated with ‘pseudo-Kufic’ lettering – an imitation of Arabic calligraphy often used in medieval and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> Italian painting to distinguish biblical figures whose origins were in the Holy Land. The priest’s striped headdress is decorated with floral designs similar to those found on Persian and Ottoman ceramics, and the woman in the yellow veil wears a cap decorated with rows of pearls, probably also intended as a sign of her eastern origins. All these details reflect the trading and diplomatic relationship between Venice and the Turkish Ottoman empire.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s nakedness emphasises his vulnerability, and his position on the altar is probably intended to bring to mind a sacrifice – like that of a lamb, part of Jewish religious tradition in this period. In the Gospels, John the Baptist refers to Christ as the ‘lamb of God’, anticipating his sacrifice at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. So, while the picture depicts a moment from Christ’s infancy, it foreshadows his adulthood and the events that became the foundation of the Christian faith.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Paintings of this subject were highly popular in Venice in the late fifteenth and early sixteenth centuries. In order to meet the huge demand for his pictures, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> had a large workshop of assistants who produced works in his style. This painting was made by workshop members who produced pictures with his signature. Bellini may have contributed to the women’s faces, but the texture of the fabrics is not as convincing as in his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F21-0001-0000-0000.htm">portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan</a>, for example, suggesting that much of the work was done by his assistants.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It inspired numerous copies in Venice and beyond. The close-up view and the arrangement of the figures comes from a composition by Bellini’s brother-in law, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Andrea Mantegna</a>. It shows the presentation of Christ as a baby in the Temple (Gemäldegalerie, Berlin), a picture that Bellini himself adapted (Museo della Fondazione Querini Stampalia, Venice).</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This unidentified young man dressed plainly in black stares back at us from the canvas. He stands upright and motionless while behind him frothy clouds race across the sky. The composition has been carefully centred so that a vertical line could be drawn straight down the bridge of his nose and through the fastening of his jacket. The jacket appears to be of black velvet lined with dark brown fur – small tufts of which poke out from where it is fastened down the front. Catena has indicated all the individual strands of the man’s hair with minute attention to detail.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The head and shoulders view resembles the sculpted portrait busts that were popular in Venice at the time and is reminiscent of a modern passport photo. The symmetry of the composition draws our attention to the slight imperfections of the young man’s features: both his eyes slant slightly down to the right, his fringe is longer and his hair more tousled on the right-hand side. The young man’s impassive stare and expressionless lips record his appearance but reveal little of his personality.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Catena has limited his palette to mainly brown, black and blue, arranged into large areas of colour, creating a strong, arresting image. However, these blocks of colour form a pattern on the surface of the canvas rather than giving a sense that the young man is occupying a real space. This results in a feeling of psychological distance between us and the sitter. Catena may have been taught to paint by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a> and the crisp, formal style of this portrait is similar to those by Bellini, such as his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Portrait of a Young Man</span> of about 1490–5 in the National Gallery of Art Washington, or his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F21-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Doge Leonardo Loredan</a></span> of 1501–2.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The painting has been attributed to Catena for stylistic reasons since 1897. It may be the portrait recorded as the artist’s work in 1643. It was probably painted in about 1510 – about the same time that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>, who was also closely aware of Giovanni Bellini’s example, painted his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0DCU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of Gerolamo (?) Barbarigo</a></span>. Titian turns his sitter sideways into the picture space and captures Barbarigo’s momentary glance over his shoulder at us, creating a strong sense of realism and psychological intimacy. Catena’s portrait must have looked quite old-fashioned in comparison.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">However, Catena was an accomplished portraitist, commissioned by important patrons such as Doge Andrea Gritti; the celebrated Italian poet Gian Giorgio Trissino (Louvre, Paris) and Raymond Fugger of the wealthy German banking family (Kaiser Friedrich Museum, Berlin). By the 1520s his style had become softer and more atmospheric in response to the work of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>, with whom Catena had collaborated before Giorgione’s death in 1510. Catena’s later portraits also have a stronger sense of the sitter’s individual character, which may be derived from his knowledge of portraits by his Venetian contemporary <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PY7-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo Lotto</a>.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a> translated the Bible into Latin from the original Greek and Hebrew. He is shown here reading in the peace and quiet of his study, the lower walls of which are lined with a green silk velvet curtain. He has left Rome, which may be the city visible in the distance through the window, and retreated to Bethlehem where he has founded a Latin monastery and a convent.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jerome’s traditional attribute of a lion lies on the ground near his creased slippers. According to legend, Saint Jerome tamed a lion by removing a thorn from its paw while he was living as a hermit in the wilderness of the Syrian desert. The lion is so docile that a partridge passes by unharmed. Partridges appear in other images of Saint Jerome in his study, such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FZ5-0001-0000-0000.htm">this example</a> by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello da Messina</a> (as do the discarded slippers). Two partridges also appear in Catena’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F47-0001-0000-0000.htm">A Warrior adoring the Infant Christ and the Virgin</a></span>. The partridge may be associated with truth and deceit.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Typical of Catena, everything is carefully organised, almost as if to geometrical principles. Jerome is seated on a bench at a spacious L-shaped desk surrounded by books, an inkwell, an unlit candle and Crucifix. The figure of Christ is set against the pale blue sky. It is not clear how the Crucifix is attached to the desk, and it may be intended to represent the subject of Jerome’s thoughts – like a vision. He rests his head in one hand as he reads from an open volume. Another book stands on the elaborate brass lectern before him, which is ornamented with a brass lion’s paw and has a long pointed spike to which a candle could be attached. In the open wall cupboards are a wicker flagon, a jar, and more of Saint Jerome’s books.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We do not know for whom the picture was painted, but it may have been made to hang in a priest’s study. All the objects in the room are of good quality and are meticulously painted. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PKD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Catena</a> may have been taught by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>, and it is easy to see the influence of Bellini’s clear, crisp style here.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint Jerome was traditionally shown in the red robes of a cardinal, even though the office of cardinal did not exist in his time. The pink and blue of Jerome’s robes and the blue of his cardinal’s hat here are unusual. It is not clear why Catena has chosen to depart from tradition in this way. Until the 1460s it was customary for cardinals to wear a violet or blue cape unless granted the privilege of wearing red when acting on papal business, or in penitence or mourning. It was also common for cardinals to wear blue hats prior to appointment if they were not bishops (Saint Jerome was not a bishop). The blue hood of his cassock is also like those worn by parish priests in Venice at the beginning of the sixteenth century. Perhaps Catena simply wanted the hat to balance the blue of the sky and the hood to draw our eye to Saint Jerome.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is another version of the painting in the Staedel Institut, Frankfurt-am-Main, as well as one sold at Sotheby’s in London on 3 July 1997.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small double-sided painting was most probably made for private worship. The front shows Saint Jerome kneeling in front of a crucifix wedged into the stump of a tree.

The lion resting beside him was his companion from the moment he removed a thorn from its foot.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Dürer’s version of the desert – or wilderness – in which the saint lived for years is particularly northern European. The grasses and flowers around his knees, for example, are closely observed and include a number of different varieties. Two little goldfinches perch by the edge of a stream, one drinking from it (the bird was traditionally a symbol of Christ’s Passion).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The reverse depicts a dark sky and what might be planets, a comet or meteorite or an eclipse, possibly a reference to Saint John the Evangelist’s descriptions of the end of the world as recorded in the Book of Revelation.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a>, which is painted on both sides, was most probably made for private worship. Intended to be portable, it could be turned over in the owner’s hands so they could view each side. The front shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EL6-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Jerome</a> kneeling in front of a crucifix wedged into the stump of a tree. He was a scholar, and his major achievement was to translate the Bible – which he clutches in his right hand – from Greek into Latin. The text, known as the Vulgate, is still used by the Roman Catholic Church today. To honour his contribution to the Church, Jerome was often shown wearing the robes and wide-brimmed hat of a cardinal, although the office didn‘t exist in his lifetime. In this painting, these are discarded on the ground in front of him.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">According to his legend, Jerome lived as a hermit in the desert outside Bethlehem, where he had retreated to escape the worldly temptations of Rome. There, according to his writings, he used to ’fling [himself] at Jesus‘ feet… and ceased not to beat my breast till tranquillity returned to me.’ This practice was intended to provoke empathy for Christ’s <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>. The lion resting beside him here is also a common feature of images of the saint; Jerome removed a thorn from the lion’s paw and from that day onward the animal did not leave his side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images of Jerome were very popular in Italy but until this time they were largely unknown in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a>’s native Germany. The artist almost certainly made this painting after his return from Venice, where he travelled in 1495. Dürer’s version of the desert – or wilderness – is particularly northern European. The saint’s figure is dwarfed against a vast landscape of craggy cliffs filled with coniferous and deciduous trees; some even spring from the crevices of the crags. The wooded area on the left of the picture encloses the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F4S-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gothic</a> spire of a church, its point matching the peaks of the distant, snow-capped mountain range. The alpine setting is clearly inspired by Germany, and its features recall the numerous detailed watercolour studies that  Dürer made directly from nature. These studies express his interest in the natural world and his intensive study of even its most humble elements. The grasses and flowers around Jerome’s knees, for example, are closely observed and include a number of different varieties. Two little goldfinches perch by the edge of a stream, one drinking from it (the bird was traditionally a symbol of Christ’s Passion). The lion probably comes from a study on parchment (now in the print room of the Hamburg Kunsthalle) that Dürer made in 1494, although that work shows the lion standing rather than lying down. The fine hairs of the lion’s mane are highlighted in the sunlight, just like those of Jerome’s soft, wispy beard.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bright yellow of the sunset (or sunrise) dominates the picture, its dazzling luminosity reinforcing the intensity of Jerome’s prayer. Above the clouds it deepens to a peach and then a soft red. The clouds are dark and foreboding and, coupled with the setting of abundant and untamed nature, create a tense and dramatic atmosphere. The potential of light to create atmosphere would have become familiar to Dürer from his study of Venetian painting, particularly the works of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni Bellini</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The sense of foreboding created by the turbulent sky in the image of Saint Jerome is developed on the reverse of the panel, which shows a celestial body with a streaming red tail against a dark night sky; it’s unclear if it is a comet, a meteorite falling to earth or an eclipse. The image has been interpreted as a representation of the end of the world as described in the Book of Revelation by Saint John the Evangelist. Many fifteenth- and sixteenth-century images of Jerome included allusions to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETD-0008-0000-0000.htm">Last Judgement</a> as, according to medieval texts, he was regarded as a prophet of it, having heard the trumpets that were a sign of Christ’s judgement at the end of the world (Revelation 8: 6–9: 21). The reverse might then be intended to represent one of the six signs of the Apocalypse revealed to John: ‘the sun became black as sackcloth, the full moon became like blood, and the stars of the sky fell to the earth as the fig tree sheds its winter fruit when shaken by a gale’ (Revelation 6: 12–13).</p></div>

However, predellas were already rare in Venetian art during <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PO9-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giorgione</a>’s lifetime. This was because altarpieces changed from being <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptychs</a> formed from many panels, to a unified image on a single panel. The predella usually contained narrative scenes relating to the main subject of the altarpiece. The main panel of this altarpiece may have been an image of the Virgin and Child.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Joseph</a> are sitting on the steps of the stable where Christ has been born. The ox traditionally included in this scene watches from the left. The Virgin holds the naked Christ Child on her lap. She and Joseph look down pensively; only the infant Christ looks directly at us, his finger in his mouth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Three Kings</a> have brought gifts to present to Christ and kneel at a slight distance from the holy family. Caspar has already given his glass casket of myrrh to Saint Joseph; the oldest king, Melchior is about to present his gift of a golden bowl. Balthasar, the youngest king, kneels further away holding a glass orb that probably contains frankincense. The crowd of attendants wear exotic costumes and turbans, suggesting their origins in the East. A soldier in plate armour and a helmet directs the attention of his dark skinned companion towards the holy family. Two young pages stand behind Balthasar while two grooms hold the horses. The groom with his back to us is also included in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PFQ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dosso Dossi’s</a> later <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Adoration of the Kings</span>, suggesting that he had seen Giorgione’s panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The pensive stillness of the holy family contrasts with the bustle of the kings’ retainers, who face in different directions and go about their business. The third king’s head is almost masked by that of the first king. Giorgione seems to enjoy demonstrating his ability to arrange complex groups of figures rather than preserving the more traditional, frieze-like  composition of the scene. His arrangement of the retinue allows him to include figures in unusual and difficult poses, such as the groom with his back to us and the standard bearer who is turning round with his legs crossed.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Tiny decorative details are included to catch our eye and draw our gaze across the panel: the seam has burst on the seat of the groom’s trousers; the retainer in the green fur-lined cloak wears an unusual hat decorated with a pattern of silver arabesques; a similar pattern appears on the belt of the young standard bearer at far right whose costume is even more elaborate than those of the kings; the horses’ harnesses are decorated with silver studs. Bright contrasting colours are used to create a rhythm across the scene, linking the groups of figures and tying the various parts of the composition together.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting is part of the so-called ‘Allendale Group’ (after the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Allendale Nativity</span> in the National Gallery of Art, Washington, which is almost unanimously accepted as by him) – paintings which form the cornerstones of our understanding of Giorgione’s work.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is a rare surviving portrait by the Venetian painter and manuscript illuminator Jacometto, and it shows his delicate and refined painting style. The boy’s beauty is probably an idealised version of reality; portraits were thought to represent the subject’s soul as well as their facial features, and beauty was associated with good character.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacometto has adopted several elements of the successful and popular portraiture style of the Sicilian artist Antonello da Messina who arrived in Venice in 1475. These include the dark background, the cropped view of the torso turned slightly to the sitters' right and the strong lighting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture’s small size and its reverse, which is painted with an abstract pattern imitating marble, mean it was probably intended to be carried with its owner as a keepsake of the boy.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small, exquisite portrait of a young boy is a very rare example of the work of the Venetian painter and manuscript illuminator known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBT-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacometto</a>. The boy’s smooth, creamy skin is painted with such fine and densely placed brushstrokes that the paint looks like enamel. His cheeks are flushed almost neon pink, his prominent pouting lips a more subtle shade of rose; both emphasise the vitality of youth. His eyes are clear and his gaze sincere. His shiny strawberry blonde waves are combed to perfection.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Although we don‘t know who this boy was, Jacometto’s image is a portrait of youth and beauty. The tradition of creating idealised portraits was well established by the time Jacometto made this picture; <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> thinkers theorised that outward appearance was the mirror of the soul. The main reason that portraits were commissioned was to commemorate someone for posterity and so it was not just their face but also their character and soul that were thought to be present in the image. The scale of this portrait and its reverse, which is decorated to resemble marble, suggest that it was intended to be carried with its owner as a keepsake (like a photograph) rather than hung permanently on a wall. Several other portraits attributed to Jacometto, including his <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0G2Z-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span>, have painted reverses.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Portraiture was an important type of painting in Venice and its citizens were keen patrons and collectors of portraits. Venice was a Republic ruled by an elected leader – the doge – rather than a dukedom like many Italian states. Venetian painters portrayed middle-class citizens as well as leaders, perhaps explaining why there are so many surviving portraits of unidentified sitters. It also explains why many of them were dressed in the same plain, unostentatious outfits as this young man. Venetians valued the philosophy of a collective identity and being painted wearing the outfit of the citizens, without any personalised embellishment, reinforced this sense of unity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacometto has adopted a format for portraits that was popularised in the city by the Sicilian painter <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0P29-0001-0000-0000.htm">Antonello da Messina</a>. If you look at Antonello’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FSU-0001-0000-0000.htm">Portrait of a Man</a></span> you’ll see that both share the plain dark background and a close-up view, showing only the head and shoulders. In both the sitter’s body is angled slightly to his right, facing into a strong light, so the face is seen in a three-quarter view and partially shadowed on the left-hand side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Antonello arrived in Venice in 1475 and his portrait style, strongly influenced by examples from the Southern Netherlands, soon became hugely popular. It is not difficult to see why local artists like Jacometto quickly borrowed the elements of his successful formula. The only difference is that here the boy does not look at us, as many of Antonello’s sitters do. Instead, he looks into the distance; he does not engage with viewers directly. The direct gaze of Antonello’s portraits was not universally adopted – <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PL9-0001-0000-0000.htm"> Giovanni Bellini</a>, for example, always showed his sitters looking beyond the picture surface, never catching the viewer’s eye.</p></div>

He was fascinated by the art of classical antiquity: the disciples here look like statues of Roman emperors in togas. One lies with his legs facing straight out at the viewer, a difficult pose to paint; Mantegna enjoyed experimenting with it for its ability to draw us into the picture.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He skilfully uses the landscape setting to tell the story in a single image, the march of the soldiers from the city gates creating drama and suggesting the passage of time. He uses his favoured fast-drying egg tempera paint (pigments bound with egg) to describe minute details like the individual bricks of the city walls.</p></div>

Aware that his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EED-0008-0000-0000.htm">disciple</a> <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQ4-0008-0000-0000.htm">Judas</a> had betrayed him, he left Jerusalem and took refuge in Gethsemane, just outside the city, to pray. Christ’s prayer displays his humanity: ‘My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me' (Matthew 26: 39). Ultimately, however, he faces the instruments of his torture and death, presented to him by the cherubs assembled on a cloud. The rocks Christ kneels before look like an altar within a church, complete with Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Three other disciples – Peter, James and John – were meant to be keeping watch but have fallen asleep. In the meantime Christ’s fate literally marches on: a long band of soldiers, led by Judas, emerges from the city gates to arrest him. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QBV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Mantegna</a> uses the landscape setting to capture the momentum and tension of the event. As the tiny, sketchy figures of the soldiers progress down the curving slopes of the hillside their menacing presence comes into focus and we see their armour and faces clearly.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the meantime, two rabbits confront each other just beneath the cherubs’ cloud; others play-fight near the stream. Two egrets stand in the stream, symbolic of the purification of baptism, the beginning of the Christian life. Plants and grasses sprout from the rich brown soil, showing Mantegna’s close observation of nature. A determined sapling fig has burst through the rock above the disciples, and tiny parallel strokes of white paint represent its smooth, dense bark. Its prominence here may represent Judas’s betrayal: when Judas heard of Jesus’s fate, he hanged himself; early legends told that he chose the fig tree as his gallows.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mantegna indulges his interest in the sculpture and architecture of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQS-0008-0000-0000.htm">antiquity</a> as well as his love of painting stone and rock forms. He contrasts the warm, red, gently eroded rocks in the foreground with the improbably conical, craggy mountains in the distance. He painted figures like statues: Christ’s ringlets look like finely chiselled stone. The cherubs’ leg muscles are defined in such detail that they seem too weighty to be carried by a cloud; rather than angelic apparitions they reflect the work of Mantegna’s contemporary, the Florentine sculptor <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QAR-0001-0000-0000.htm">Donatello</a>. The statue of a knight upon a horse covered in gold leaf atop a high column in the city recalls Roman equestrian statues but also <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FK2-0008-0000-0000.htm">Renaissance</a> revivals of the form, such as Donatello’s notable bronze in Padua of a general known as Gattamelata, which Mantegna must have known. The sleeping disciples look like toppled marble statues of Roman emperors, the folds of their robes unnaturally pristine and crisp, and folded over their shoulders like togas.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting dates from early in Mantegna’s career when he was still in Padua, near Venice, where he trained. The image might be based upon a drawing by his father-in-law, Jacopo Bellini, now in the British Museum. Mantegna also used the image as the basis for a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ECZ-0008-0000-0000.htm">predella</a> panel made at around the same time as this picture for an altarpiece for the church of San Zeno, Verona. The image unites the family: Jacopo’s son, Giovanni Bellini, made a painting of <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FFR-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Agony in the Garden</a></span> (also in the National Gallery’s collection), based upon Mantegna’s image.</p></div>
