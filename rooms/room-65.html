        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s disciples were gathered together 50 days after his death when, according to the Bible, a strong wind began to blow. Flames like ‘tongues of fire’ appeared on their heads and they were filled with the Holy Ghost (Acts 2: 1–4). This event, called Pentecost, was when the disciples were given the divine authority to preach about Christ and his message.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, the Holy Ghost is represented as a tiny white dove above the Virgin Mary’s head and we can see the double-tongued flames on the disciples' heads. It is very likely that it was one of a series of scenes that made up a larger work, probably a triptych (a picture made up of three panels). In the church of San Giovanni Battista in Alba there is a picture of the Virgin and Child signed by Barnaba di Modena and dated 1377. It may have been the central panel of this triptych.</p></div>

The disciples were filled with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a> and began to speak miraculously in a number of languages (Acts 2: 1–4). This moment, known as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FRD-0008-0000-0000.htm">Pentecost</a>, was when the disciples were given the divine authority – through receiving the Holy Ghost – to go out to preach about Christ and his message. Their ability to speak a number of different languages was therefore important.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Here, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> presides over the gathering. Her robe is covered in gold striations – lines that make it look as though she is bathed in divine light. The artist often used this technique, which was popular with artists of the earlier fourteenth century, to make holy figures stand out (look at his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0GA7-0001-0000-0000.htm">scenes of the coronation of the Virgin and image of the Trinity</a>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Holy Ghost is represented as a tiny white dove above the Virgin’s head; it has miraculously flown through the beamed ceiling and is surrounded by holy light, represented as a red semi-circle. The Virgin and disciples look towards it and clasp their hands in prayer. On their heads are the double-tongued flames described in the biblical account.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A dowel (wooden peg) on the reverse of this panel shows that it was once connected to another picture; it is very likely that it was one of a series of scenes that made up a larger work. Two other pictures of similar dimensions have been connected with it: an image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E55-0008-0000-0000.htm">Ascension</a> (Pinacoteca Capitolina, Rome) and a scene of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a> (Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan). It is possible that these pictures belonged to a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a> which consisted of two rows of scenes framing a central image of the Virgin and Child.

Gold leaf was commonly used as a background on panel paintings but this one stands out for its liberal use of ultramarine, an expensive, rich blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a> made from the rare semi-precious stone lapis lazuli.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">At the top left we see the coronation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a>. This event, when <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> crowned his mother the Queen of Heaven, is described in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span> as a glorious moment accompanied by angels playing music. The angels in the front row play a portable organ and the nakers – a set of kettle drums strapped to one of the angel’s backs.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">To the right of this is a representation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Trinity</a>, the one Christian God made up of three divine figures: God the Father, who glows with golden light within a blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAB-0008-0000-0000.htm">mandorla</a>; the son, Christ, shown on the Cross; the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>, a dove descending upon Christ as though being blown from God’s mouth. All three figures emanate golden rays of light. They are surrounded by the symbols of the authors of the four Gospels: John is shown as an eagle, Matthew as a winged man or angel, Luke as an ox and Mark as a lion. The Virgin Mary and John the Evangelist, who were both present at the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, are seated on the ground at the foot of the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The busy scene below the Trinity shows the Crucifixion. The two thieves who were crucified at the same time as Christ appear on either side of him. The Virgin Mary faints in grief, supported by three other women. John the Evangelist, wringing his hands, stands behind. Mary Magdalene, long hair flowing, reaches up to the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Finally, we see the Virgin and Christ Child seated on a makeshift throne. A man and woman, probably the people who commissioned the picture, kneel before them. We know that two other pictures made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PD1-0001-0000-0000.htm">Barnaba da Modena</a> were sent to Spain and also include figures of the patrons; one was probably made for the chapel of the Manuel family in Murcia Cathedral. The woman in those pictures has been identified as Juana Manuel, a powerful noblewoman who became Queen of Castile through marriage in 1369 – as has the blonde woman in our painting, her crown indicating her royal status. The man in front of her does not have a crown; rather than being her husband, King Henry of Castile, he might be her father, who died before this picture was made. The Archangel Raphael presents him to the Virgin and Child in heaven.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of only two small-scale works by Cimabue, rediscovered in 2000. Soon after this, a link was made between it and a panel in the Frick Collection, New York which depicts the Flagellation. They were both probably part of a much larger panel painted with small images showing the events leading up to Christ’s death. A third panel from the same group, <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Mocking of Christ</span>, was discovered in a French private collection in 2019 and is now in the collection of the Musée du Louvre, Paris.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two angels with long feathered wings present the Virgin and Child to the viewer. This scene references Christ’s suffering and death through the cloth on which the Virgin is seated. It resembles the kind placed upon an altar used for the Eucharist – the ritual at which Christians remember Christ’s death by drinking wine and eating bread together. This scene is based on a Byzantine model which Cimabue has altered: he has made the throne three-dimensional and included an affectionate gesture between mother and child. These adjustments catered to Western Christians for whom a personal relationship with God was key.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the earliest paintings in the National Gallery’s collection and a rare surviving work by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QR6-0001-0000-0000.htm">Cimabue</a>. Until this work was rediscovered in 2000, Cimabue was known only for large-scale works including frescoes, painted crucifixes and monumental images of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FVJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin and Child enthroned</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cimabue was working at a time when Italian artists were adopting and adapting images and motifs from the religious art of the Eastern Christian empire, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantium</a>. Cimabue transformed these traditionally formal images into representations that were more accessible to Western Christians who were concerned with developing a personal relationship with God. His experiments with three-dimensional settings and gesture were highly influential on the next generation of Italian painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> is seated on a wooden throne, holding the infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> on her lap. The cushion beneath her curls up slightly at the edges, giving an impression of their weight. This, along with the three-dimensional structure of the throne, creates a sense of real presence before a worshipper.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two angels with long feathered wings present the Virgin and Child to the viewer, gripping the throne with their slender fingers. They wear red and white headbands, red stockings and black shoes. Between their pink tunics and pale purple robes are decorated strips of brown fabric studded with pearls. These decorated bands resemble the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">loros</span> – an embroidered and jewel-studded textile that was part of the ceremonial costume of the emperors and empresses of the Byzantine Empire. Cimabue uses the visual language of earthly power to reflect the Christian idea of the Virgin and Christ as the Queen and King of Heaven. The entire image is comparable with a Byzantine prototype where the angels are identified as the archangels <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Michael</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EO7-0008-0000-0000.htm">Gabriel</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Christ Child grabbing at his mother’s hand, as any baby might, creates an intimate image of motherhood. The image also has a complex message to aid the devotions of the viewer: while Christ is absorbed in this activity the Virgin and the angels look towards the viewer, with whom they share a knowledge of Christ’s divine nature and his fate as an adult. The cloth on which the Virgin is seated, with its decorated border, also hints at Christ’s suffering and death. It resembles the kind placed upon an altar used to bless the bread and wine of the Eucharist, shared by Christians at Mass in commemoration of Christ’s death and renewal of their faith.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel is damaged at the left and upper edges, most likely due to the removal of a frame. The other edges remain intact, with painted red borders. This suggests that it was framed together with a number of other scenes, painted on the same piece of wood and separated from one another by red lines, either as a single devotional panel or possibly as a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FQD-0008-0000-0000.htm">dossal</a>. Alternatively, the panel might have been cut from a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a>, composed of two panels depicting various scenes from the Passion of Christ. After the National Gallery bought the work, it was connected with another of equal scale at the Frick Collection, New York, which shows the<span class="dokuwiki_italic"> Flagellation</span>. In 2019, a further picture depicting<span class="dokuwiki_italic"> The Mocking of Christ</span>, which is also the same size and which clearly relates to the same series, was discovered in a private collection in France and is now in the Musée du Louvre, Paris. As a group, the panels allow, for the first time, for an appreciation of how Cimabue applied his innovations in transforming Byzantine models for Western Christians on a small scale.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This scene is rare in Italian art. The kneeling figure on the left is the Blessed Clare, a holy woman who lived in Rimini from the late thirteenth to early fourteenth centuries. According to her biography, she saw <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> enthroned and surrounded by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD9-0008-0000-0000.htm">apostles</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a> (shown holding on to Christ and wearing a camel-skin tunic, as was traditional). Our painting shows that vision.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In Clare’s vision, Christ – the largest figure in this scene – showed her the wound on his side where he was pierced by a spear at his <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">crucifixion</a>, as we see here. As she prayed for mercy, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a> – shown here in pink robes – gave her a book inscribed with Christ’s words recorded in the Gospel of John: ‘My peace I give you my peace I leave you’ (John 14: 27). Clare was born in the 1260s. At the age of 34, she had a vision of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> surrounded by angels and began to lead a pious and selfless life, ministering to the sick. She founded a small convent with six companions. The chequered robes Clare wears in this painting are similar to those worn by the poor, and express her poverty and humility.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There is an almost identical but smaller picture in the Musée Fesch, Ajaccio, Corsica, which is part of an altarpiece made up of three panels (the others are <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Adoration of the Magi</span> and <span class="dokuwiki_italic">The Crucifixion</span>). Cardinal Giuseppe Garampi, an eighteenth-century biographer of Clare, revealed that the Fesch picture was made for the convent’s parlour at Santa Maria degli Angeli in Rimini. Clare also featured in a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> painting (now destroyed) in the chapter house of the same church. According to Garampi, the chapter house contained another altarpiece showing the vision of the Blessed Clare. He only describes the scene of Clare’s vision but it seems likely that he is talking about our panel, and that it was once part of a larger altarpiece. Since then, our picture has been associated with an image of the Adoration of the Magi now in Coral Gables, University of Miami, Florida.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Further documents that describe Clare’s canonisation – the moment her cult received approval – by Pope Pius VI in 1782 reveal that the altarpiece in the chapter house had a central image of the Virgin and Child with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mary Magdalene</a> and suggest that three <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXD-0008-0000-0000.htm">pinnacles</a> crowned it. It’s been suggested that two of these showed the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EWI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Annunciation</a> to the Virgin Mary, with the annunciating angel on one side and the Virgin Mary on the other. The angel has been identified in a private collection. It has also been suggested that the central pinnacle was an image of the Crucifixion (now in the Musée des Beaux Arts, Strasbourg) though this is less likely.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It is possible that the altarpiece our picture and the Coral Gables panel, both larger than the Ajaccio pictures, were part of was originally made for the high altar of Santa Maria degli Angeli. Clare died in 1326 and was buried beneath the high altar of the church, so it would have been suitable to have this picture above it. The patron may have been <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a>: <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Francis</a> is present in the Crucifixion scene in Ajaccio and in the possible Crucifixion pinnacle in Strasbourg.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin, face partly obscured by her vast blue cloak, places a hand on her son’s bloody wound. He is shown upright, after his crucifixion. The image of Christ displaying his wounds after death was popular in the late Middle Ages as a focus for meditation upon his suffering. The spear used to pierce his side is painted on the back of the panel, along with other tools of the Crucifixion, including a hammer and nails.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel was originally the left half of a pair of images hinged together, or possibly part of a triptych (an object made up of three panels). The other part shows Saint John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene looking towards Christ in grief (Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist probably belonged to one of the Florentine painter Giotto’s workshops in Naples. This might have been made for Sancia, wife of the city’s ruler Robert of Anjou, whose particular focus for prayer was the body of Christ.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We see <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> after the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, bloody and almost naked. He is shown upright after death; this might seem unusual, but this type of image was very popular in the late Middle Ages as a focus for prayer and meditation on Christ’s suffering. His mother <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary</a> holds his limp arm with one hand and touches his wound with the other. Blood drips down his stomach and pools in his loin cloth, only just visible but decorated with gold at its border. Christ’s eyes roll back slightly in their sockets. His muscles are drawn as simple, interconnecting shapes, with white lines highlighting his ribs and diaphragm. The Virgin and Christ’s facial features are outlined simply; they share narrow eyes, with eyelids that converge almost to a point, and a long straight nose.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>, a Florentine artist, was called to Naples to work for its ruler, Robert of Anjou, in 1328. While he was there he assembled a large workshop of assistants. The painter of this panel may have worked with him on creating <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a> for the church of Santa Chiara. The angels above Christ and the Virgin are similar in pose and gesture to the mourning angels in the scene of the Lamentation of Christ in the Arena Chapel in Padua, Giotto’s most famous fresco cycle. The figures are broad and bulky, echoing the fullness of Giotto’s forms – the contour of the Virgin’s veil from head to neck leaves little definition of her neck, for example. This style might also show that the artist was more accustomed to painting in fresco, where bold shapes enabled the viewer to see the image clearly from a distance. The stark image is framed by an intricately incised border, creating a delicate, decorative effect.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The reverse is also painted, but probably not by Giotto or his workshop. The monochrome image shows the Cross of the Crucifixion, erected on a hillock. In front of it is a pot containing three nails, alongside which lies a hammer: the tools of the Crucifixion. Also shown are the spear that pierced Jesus’s side, giving him the wound he bears in the main painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This panel probably formed the left half of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> or maybe even a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a>. Another panel which probably belonged to the same object (now in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York) shows Saint John the Evangelist and Mary Magdalene grieving. Two lamenting angels swoop above, mirroring this panel.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">There are two suggestions about who may have owned the picture: a friar called Fra Philip Alquier, who was the spiritual adviser to the nuns of Santa Chiara, where the painter may have worked, or the wife of Robert of Anjou, Queen Sancia of Naples. Both were known for their devotion to Christ’s sufferings. Philip is said to have bled, like Christ, from his hands, feet and side, so intense was his prayer. A letter from Sancia describes her prayerful meditations on Christ’s body. The presence of Mary Magdalene reinforces this suggestion: Fra Philip was the Guardian of the convent of Santa Maria Maddalena, which Sancia had founded for women who had formerly sold sex. Sancia also owned a relic of Mary Magdalene’s finger.</p></div>

The chosen scenes are also unusual: the upper scene on the left shows the ascension of Saint John the Evangelist to heaven, an image practically unknown in Western art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mourners bow in respect towards Saint John’s tomb beneath an altar; the saint – wearing a bishop’s mitre – is shown far above them in heaven surrounded by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a>, angels and other saints. This scene is complemented by the coronation of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin</a> which, according to the <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F45-0008-0000-0000.htm">Golden Legend</a></span>, took place after her assumption into heaven.

Between them a group of pagan philosophers bow down before her, converted to Christianity by her words. The smallest scene at the bottom right shows <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETF-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saints Francis</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>; both had spent time in prayer and abstinence in the desert and so they share this arid, mountainous landscape. Saint Francis is shown kneeling to receive the stigmata – wounds identical to those of Christ after his hands were nailed to the Cross. If you look closely you’ll see that <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0T7Q-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giovanni,</a> the artist, has used varying shades of red to depict the blood on his hands. John the Baptist is recognisable because of his camel-skin tunic, the simple and uncomfortable clothing he wore in the desert.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The textiles are particularly elaborate: the Virgin’s robes are painted with striations (stripes) in gold leaf which follow the lines of the drapery folds and give the impression that she is glowing; others are decorated with gold floral patterns. This emphasis on elegance, gilding and decorative patterns recalls the art of the Eastern Christian (Byzantine) empire – Giovanni’s hometown of Rimini had close trade links with Byzantium on account of its position on the eastern coast of Italy. Each figure has a different facial expression: puzzled, amazed, devout or serious. The bulky figures, such as the chubby children in the top left scene, and the attempt at creating convincingly three-dimensional architectural features show the influence of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q4A-0001-0000-0000.htm">Giotto</a>, who was working in Rimini at the turn of the fourteenth century when this panel was made.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Another picture by Giovanni (Galleria Nazionale d’Arte Antica, Palazzo Barberini, Rome) has the same dimensions, and its six scenes of episodes from the life of Christ are all divided with a decorative red and blue border identical to that in our panel (although the scenes are of equal size, unlike here). It’s unlikely the two formed a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a> since there is no evidence of holes for connecting hinges, but it’s highly likely they were made as a pair and used for private contemplation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The prominence of Saint John the Evangelist in our panel might link it to the church of Sant Agostino in Rimini. There was a community of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E8Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Augustinian</a> hermits there, but the church was dedicated to Saint John the Evangelist before their arrival in the mid-thirteenth century. After that time it was dedicated to both saints.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The artist of this panel has sculpted the drops of blood which fall from Christ’s side and hands and then painted over them to emphasise their gore. The circular wounds in Christ’s hands were caused by the nails of the Crucifixion and the wound in his ribcage by a Roman soldier’s spear. Christ’s head dangles limply to one side and heavy eyelids seal his eyes closed. He is shown in death but standing upright in his open tomb.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This kind of image showing the dead Christ with a focus on his wounds was called the ‘Imago Pietatis’ (‘image of pity’) or the Man of Sorrows. It was based upon an image from Byzantium, the Eastern Christian empire, and its purpose was to inspire empathy for Christ’s suffering and death.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Byzantine images were particularly popular in Venice which had close links with Byzantium. This picture has been removed from the frame which connected it to a larger multi-panelled altarpiece. The location of the other panels has not been established.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Images like this were made to provoke empathy for <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a>’s suffering and death. He is shown after death, upright inside his open tomb, naked apart from a transparent loin cloth. His halo, which is now quite damaged, is encircled with rays; geometric shapes painted red, blue and green imitate gemstones. His hands cross in front of his concave stomach. Fat drops of blood drip from his hands and a slit-like wound in his side.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The droplets stand out from the picture surface – the artist sculpted them using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB6-0008-0000-0000.htm">gesso</a> (a type of plaster), then painted over them. He may have been inspired by sculptural representations of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> known as <span class="dokuwiki_italic">crocefissi dolorosi</span> (’sorrowful crucifixes‘). White highlights on the ribcage and collarbone make them appear protruded as they catch the light, emphasising Christ’s emaciation. His eyes are closed; dark upturned crescents emphasise the heaviness of the lids. The image is a detailed study of physical pain and hardship.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This kind of image was known as the ’Imago Pietatis‘ (’image of pity‘) or the Man of Sorrows, and it is based upon an image from Byzantium, the Eastern Christian empire. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SAZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">Jacobello del Bonomo</a> was from Venice, where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> imagery was particularly common and popular. The Crusaders’ plunder of Constantinople (Byzantium’s capital) in 1204 and Venice’s trade links with the eastern Mediterranean meant there were plenty of precious Byzantine works of art to inspire Venetian artists. A particular source for this portrayal of Christ was a highly respected mosaic in a church in Rome, dating to the twelfth or thirteenth century. By the time this picture was made, the Catholic Church promised 20,000 years‘ Indulgence (the amount of time a soul would be spared purgatory before entering heaven) for praying in front of representations of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Imago pietatis</span>. It became one of the most popular religious images in Italy.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacobello adapts the tradition by including the Cross, painted in blue, behind Christ – a reminder of the Crucifixion. The uppermost crossbar contains the damaged remains of a gilded inscription: INRI (the Greek abbreviation for ’Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews'). It is connected to the main part of the Cross with what looks like a narrow tree branch. This was supposed to remind worshippers of the Tree of Life, which represents eternal life, recalling the Tree of Life in the Garden of Eden, where <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E64-0008-0000-0000.htm">humankind existed before sin</a>. The message is that Christ’s Crucifixion and death caused the forgiveness of humanity.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Jacobello also includes angels with thuribles, perfume burners swung on chains, as a way of honouring Christ’s body. Their robes are not painted but rather patterned using a technique called stippling: the gold was stamped with lots of tiny dotted indentations. This created a dense texture that would have sparkled in candlelight. Close examination reveals that the angels are hovering above little clouds, now quite damaged, painted with expensive ultramarine paint.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">An area of bare wood is exposed. This would have been covered with a frame which connected it to other pictures in an altarpiece. We do not know which altarpiece this precious and emotive image comes from but it almost certainly topped the centre of a large <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFC-0008-0000-0000.htm">polyptych</a> forming a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EXD-0008-0000-0000.htm">pinnacle</a> above an image of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and Christ Child. This would remind viewers of Christ’s ultimate fate but also of their redemption through their faith. Another example of the Man of Sorrows in this position is Crivelli’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ESZ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Dead Christ supported by Two Angels</a></span>.</p></div>

The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> occupy the central arch, with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYI-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Mark</a> on the left and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Baptist</a> on the right.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary is seated on a green mound, probably intended to represent the ground. Next to her, a gold inscription in Latin gives her title, ‘Holy Mary of Humility’. This was often given to images in which Mary is shown seated on the ground; another example is <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHJ-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child</a></span>. It’s possible that as well as being a humble pose, the title is related to the Latin word <span class="dokuwiki_italic">humus</span>, meaning ‘earth’.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Saint John, who makes a blessing gesture, holds a scroll. It is inscribed with words the saint spoke about Christ when he was preaching in the wilderness: ‘Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sins of the world’ (John 1: 29). Under his green robe he wears a camel-hair tunic. According to the Gospels, this is what he wore in the wilderness (Matthew 3: 4; Mark 1:6).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Mary’s almond-shaped eyes, with their slightly puffy lower lids, are characteristic of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q81-0001-0000-0000.htm">Lorenzo</a>’s style but other elements also point to its Venetian origins. The image of the Virgin seated on the ground probably came from Siena, but it was popular in Venice too. In Venice, it was often combined with the celestial elements we see here: the sun-shaped brooch at the Virgin’s throat, the crescent moon beneath her feet and the 12 stars – made with tiny indentations called punch marks – around her figure. These are the symbols of the so-called ‘Woman of the Apocalypse’, a cosmic mother figure mentioned in the Book of Revelation and interpreted as the Virgin Mary. The depiction of Mary as the ‘Woman of the Apocalypse’ seated on the ground emphasises her humble background and her divine role as the mother of Christ. The infant Christ’s feet are crossed and poke out of his swaddling cloth; the soles of his feet are very prominent. This may be intended to bring to mind the wounds of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>, when Christ’s hands and feet were nailed to the Cross.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture remains in its original frame, and the spiral colonettes are typical of frames made in Venice. Technical examination reveals that the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EQU-0008-0000-0000.htm">roundel</a> decorations between the arches were once in fact rosettes, later changed to the appearance they have now.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was probably made for private worship and created as an independent work, never joined to another panel (unlike many of the other small-scale early Italian pictures in our collection). Saint Mark was the patron saint of Venice; the picture might have been made for a Venetian patron, perhaps someone named after Saint John the Baptist.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the oldest pictures in our collection. By <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3R-0001-0000-0000.htm">Margarito d‘Arezzo</a>, it shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> seated on a throne with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> on her lap, enclosed within an almond shape called a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FAB-0008-0000-0000.htm">mandorla</a>. Around them are eight scenes of the lives of various saints.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This simple design is striking. The contrast of the gold leaf background with the decorative black borders and the limited use of colour – red, black, brown and gold – makes it clear and easy to read. Its horizontal shape resembles altar frontals, paintings placed in front of the altar table and used before altarpieces placed above the altar became more conventional. However, vertical channels on the reverse of our panel probably once held battens, which were inserted into the altar table to secure it – proving that it sat on top of the altar.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This depiction of the Virgin and Child stresses that Christ is the embodiment of the Old Testament notion of divine ’wisdom‘ and a spiritual ruler. The carved lions on either side of the throne are intended to bring to mind the throne of the wise Old Testament king, Solomon, described in 1 Kings: 10. In Byzantine art (the art of the Eastern Christian empire), when the Virgin is shown in this frontal pose she is known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Theotokos</span> (’Mother of God‘). This pose and the inclusion of the throne also reflects a tradition of sculpted images of the Virgin and Child in the West, known as the Mary <span class="dokuwiki_italic">maiestas</span> (’Mary of Majesty') which emphasised her rank and status as the mother of God. The Virgin wears a crown embedded with jewels, and the strips of jewels that hang down alongside her face recall the type of headdress worn by Byzantine empresses. Christ too is depicted with authority: he looks like a small man, not a baby. He makes a blessing gesture with his right hand and holds a scroll – a reminder that he is the incarnation of <span class="dokuwiki_italic">logos</span>, the word of God – in his left.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene at the far left of the top row shows the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EDU-0008-0000-0000.htm">Nativity</a>, followed by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a> being boiled in a cauldron of oil on the orders of the Roman Emperor Domitian, a torture that he survived. In the following scene, the saint brings a woman named Drusiana back to life. The naked man in the next scene is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6E-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Benedict</a>, who, having been tempted by beautiful women he saw in Rome, threw himself on the brambles outside his cave in order to overcome his desires.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The bottom row shows the decapitation of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Catherine of Alexandria</a> followed by two miracles of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETP-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Nicholas</a>. On the left he appears to a group of pilgrims and warns them to throw away the oil that was given to them by a nun – actually the devil in disguise. When they emptied it in the sea it burst into flames. Next, the saint intervenes to save the lives of three innocent men about to be beheaded. In the final scene we see <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E5Z-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint Margaret</a> being swallowed by a dragon and then miraculously bursting out of its stomach, an episode that led to her becoming the patron saint of childbirth.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">It seems most likely that the picture was made for a church dedicated to either Saint John the Evangelist or Saint Nicholas, possibly the church of Saint Nicholas in Arezzo.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We don't know the identity of the artist, but he painted a group of works for Franciscan patrons in and around Assisi. These include the image of Saint Francis for the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, after which he is named.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">He made several painted Crosses on this scale. They were probably for use in processions and originally had the same image on both sides. This one has been cut in half, probably because of damage from frequent use.

Red blood drips in neat lines from his hands and feet.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">On the panel to the left is the Virgin, supported in her grief by Mary Magdalene.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painted <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0E6A-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifix</a> is one of the earliest works in our collection, but we don‘t know the artist’s identity. It has been connected to a group of works that includes a picture of Saint Francis made for the church of Santa Maria degli Angeli, near Assisi – so the person who made them is known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q0V-0001-0000-0000.htm">Master of Saint Francis</a>. He may have been a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan</a> friar because he painted so many works for that religious order.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Crucifix has a precious, jewel-like appearance. Ultramarine, the most expensive blue <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FP9-0008-0000-0000.htm">pigment</a>, has been used for the background; the rectangular terminals that punctuate its points are decorated with a gilded trellis pattern and the whole object is edged with gold borders. Its magnificence belies the horror and sorrow of the subject matter. Christ is painted as though hanging upon the Cross. His eyes are closed and his body, limp in death, sways dramatically to one side. Red blood drips from his palms, vivid against the blue background.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The panel behind Christ’s loincloth is known as the apron and here, on either side, are figures mourning his death. To the left, the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> is supported by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EB9-0008-0000-0000.htm">Mary Magdalene</a>, who holds her firmly by the wrists to prevent her collapsing in grief. To the right is John the Evangelist, whom Christ named his ‘beloved’ disciple, with his hand on his cheek  – a melancholic gesture. Behind him is a Roman soldier. He may represent the officer in the Gospel of Luke who, at the moment of Christ’s death, recognised him as the son of God. These mourning figures emphasise sorrow and grief. Such images were made to encourage meditation upon and empathy for Christ’s sufferings, a mode of prayer particularly promoted by the Franciscans.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Small painted Crucifixes like this were popular in Umbria, a region of Assisi. The workshop of the Master of Saint Francis produced several, some of which are painted with similar images on both sides, like the one in the Galleria Nazionale dell’ Umbria in Perugia. This meant that they were visible from all directions in religious processions. The wood of this Crucifix is very thin, suggesting it was split in half some time before it was purchased for the National Gallery, possibly on account of damage caused by frequent use. A restorer has repainted and regilded the side terminals, probably following the spirit of the original design.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The gold circles in the terminals and above Christ’s head were very likely topped with glass discs. The central one almost certainly contained a relic, perhaps a piece of the Cross itself, because it contains a square cavity which has been filled in. The painting was not just a representation of Christ’s death but also a precious reliquary, an object made for the preservation and display of sacred objects.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The inscriptions in the upper terminal and on either side of Christ’s head remind the worshipper of Christ’s conquest of death through the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EYY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Resurrection</a>. The Latin words at the top – which are not original, but probably a (mispelled) copy of the original text – translate as: ‘Behold this is Jesus Christ, king of the Jews, saviour of the world and our salvation, who hung for us on the tree of life.’</p></div>

We can see bloody wounds on the backs of his hands, caused by the nails that secured him to the Cross. The holes are brown while the blood dripping from them is bright red, and Christ’s skin has the green tone of a corpse. The inscription at the top of the Cross is in Latin and means ‘Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews’; according to the Gospels it was nailed there to mock Christ (John 19:19). Two angels in the upper corners cover their eyes in despair, emphasising the horror of the sight and provoking the same reaction from the viewer.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The image of the dead Christ shown as a half-length figure with head drooping and arms crossed like this is called the Man of Sorrows. Its origins lie in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> painting (the art of the Eastern Christian empire) but it became very popular in the west in the thirteenth century. The earliest Italian versions of it can be found in manuscript illuminations dating to the second half of the thirteenth century. The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows</a> was popular with the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFE-0008-0000-0000.htm">Franciscan Order</a> as they were devoted to the contemplation of Christ’s suffering and wounds.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Cleaning the picture revealed that the Cross had been painted with three tones of brown, which might represent the three different trees from which it was thought to be made: fir, palm and cypress, according to the writer Gregory of Viterbo. The three types of wood were interpreted as symbolising the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EPB-0008-0000-0000.htm">Trinity</a>. Fragments of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EF5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Deposition</a>, by the Master of Saint Francis in the lower church of the Franciscan church at Assisi in central Italy, also show a Cross painted with three different types of brown. This effect is also found on Crucifixion scenes made in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem where, in the thirteenth century, there were many Franciscans, after the Fourth Crusade of 1204.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The strong presence of the Franciscan Order in the Holy Land meant they were familiar with Byzantine imagery which circulated there. Like the Virgin and Child on the opposite panel, this picture seems to have been copied very closely from another picture – possibly a Byzantine original. <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">Infrared reflectography</a> shows that the design, including the waves of the hair and the beard, was carefully incised with a sharp tool before painting began.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In 1999 this panel was reunited with its pair, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0CR9-0001-0000-0000.htm">an image of Christ</a> known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Man of Sorrows</a>. Together they formed a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a>, a painting made of two panels joined with a hinge.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> gestures towards the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> Child, bowing her head towards him. He looks up towards her and makes a blessing gesture with his right hand; in his left, he holds a scroll. The way that his robes are wrapped around him make him look more like a Roman emperor than a baby. His face too, with its serious expression and lined forehead, makes him appear older. Many Italian paintings of this type show Christ’s fingers arranged in a more western style of blessing (see, for example, <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F70-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Six Angels</a></span>) but the pose here, where the little finger is extended also, is particularly <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a>. The Virgin’s sorrowful expression and gesture towards Christ was intended to remind the viewer of Christ’s suffering and death, reinforced by the image of the dead Christ on the other side of the diptych. The type usually also included angels in the upper corners; these now appear above the Man of Sorrows, covering their faces in grief.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This type of representation of the infant Christ is derived from Byzantine art, where there’s an emphasis on his power and spiritual authority. The poses of the Virgin and Child also belong to Byzantine icon painting, specifically the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Virgin Hodegetria</span> (meaning, in Greek, the Virgin ’showing the way'). The original, now lost, was in the Hodegon monastery in Constantinople. The image was thought to have miracle-working properties, partly because it was thought to be based on a painting of the Virgin and Child made by Saint Luke. It became popular in Italy, in particular in Pisa, in the thirteenth century – and the painter of this panel, known as the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0SQ8-0001-0000-0000.htm">Master of the Borgo Crucifix</a>, was probably trained by the Pisan artist Giunta da Pisano. A very similar painting of the Virgin and Child in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Hodegetria</span> pose, which may be by a member of this artist’s workshop, is now in the Pinacoteca Civica, Forlì, near Bologna.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This small painting is one of the earliest in the National Gallery’s collection. It was probably made in Siena – it shares many features with Sienese painting of the period – but its combination of images is rare. It is possible that it’s based on a Byzantine (Eastern Christian) painting.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin and Child are shown in a tender pose that was popular in Byzantine icon painting. The other images narrate humanity’s salvation through the birth and death of Christ. So, just above the central image, we see the Angel Gabriel announcing to the Virgin Mary that she will give birth to the Son of God. Above this is a scene of Christ’s Crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">In the spaces on either side of this arched image are the believers (on the left) ascending to heaven and the damned (on the right) who, cowering, cannot enter heaven.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of the earliest paintings in our collection. It was probably made in Siena in a decade when devotion to the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> was at its height in the city, after she was credited with protecting its citizens against the Florentines in battle.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Its small size suggests it was made for private prayer, but it is very similar to some of the large-scale pictures of the Virgin that were being created in Siena to honour her at around the same time. One of these was the image known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna del Bordone</span> by the Sienese painter Coppo di Marcovaldo. There, as here, the Virgin wears a large white veil and cradles the Christ Child with a white cloth. These details are deliberate references to paintings of the Virgin and Child from the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F97-0008-0000-0000.htm">Byzantine</a> tradition. The pose of the figures also brings these Byzantine icons to mind. For example, there was a particular type of image of the Virgin and the baby Christ pressing their cheeks together tenderly known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">glykophilousa</span> meaning ’sweetly kissing', which is adapted slightly here. This intimacy creates a tender image of motherhood ideal for an image for private contemplation.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The surrounding images tell the story of the redemption of man through Christ’s conception by the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F02-0008-0000-0000.htm">Holy Ghost</a>  and his death. It begins in fact in the two small figures of the Angel Gabriel (on the left) and the Virgin (on the right) that seem to hover above the central image. They represent the Annunciation – the moment that the Virgin Mary conceived Christ by the Holy Ghost upon hearing Gabriel’s words. This scene has been connected to a badly damaged <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">fresco</a> which dates to around the same period. It was discovered in the crypt of the cathedral in Siena in 2003, providing further evidence that the panel was made in that city.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The scene of the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a> above this is almost identical to the Crucifixion scene shown in the crypt. In both images the Virgin Mary is shown swooning in grief supported by two women. On the right hand side of the Cross is <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EIL-0008-0000-0000.htm">Saint John the Evangelist</a>, who is described as being present in the Gospels. Next to him is the Roman centurion who, according to Luke’s Gospel, declared his faith in Christ at his Crucifixion.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">We also see groups of figures in the spandrels, the spaces on either side of the framing arch: those on the left are invited by the angel blowing a trumpet to ascend to heaven. They include a bishop and two friars – one in the brown habit of the Franciscans (the followers of Saint Francis). Like the centurion, they are believers. Those on the right, on the other hand, are the damned who are prevented from entering. Although this part of the painting is quite damaged we can see them covering their faces with their hands.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The entire composition may be drawn from a Byzantine icon as it is very unusual in Sienese painting. It is possible that it was the central panel of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FHN-0008-0000-0000.htm">triptych</a>. The presence of Franciscans among the blessed suggests that it was made for a Franciscan friar.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p>This small panel painting shows the Virgin lying asleep while a companion reads to her at the foot of her bed. Above her, Christ is crucified not on the cross, but on a golden Tree of Life that rises from the Virgin's womb, while below her, a hand reaching down from the bed opens the gates of Limbo to release Adam and Eve. <br/><br/> The subject makes explicit the idea of the redemption of mankind through the intercession of the Virgin.<br/><br/> 'The Dream of the Virgin' is thought to have been made as part of an altarpiece for a church in the artist's home town of Bologna, depicting scenes from the life of the Virgin.<br/><br/> The unusual iconography of the painting was once obscured by a layer of gold paint, which gave the work the appearance of a more conventional Crucifixion scene until it was removed in 1994 by conservators at the Courtauld Institute.</p></div>

        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The Virgin is seated on a marble seat, intricately carved and decorated with multi-coloured inlay, outlined in gold.  It resembles a Roman tomb, perhaps as a reminder of Christ’s future sacrifice at his Crucifixion. Here, Christ is shown as an infant, tenderly reaching to touch his mother’s face, a gesture also found in paintings by Duccio, Siena’s most renowned painter in the fourteenth century.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The fine detail, the decorative use of gold leaf and the gentle and graceful nature of the holy figures are key features of Sienese painting of this period. Ugolino da Nerio was a Sienese artist who was working at the same time as Duccio; he would have known Duccio’s work well and emulated his style. When this work was purchased, it was thought to be by Duccio but recent technical analysis of the drawing beneath the painted surface compares it more closely to documented works by Ugolino.</p></div>

        <h3>In-depth</h3>
        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The careful painting of intricate details in this small panel, made for private contemplation, transforms it into a precious object as well as an aid to devotion. Even the reverse, painted to imitate marble, was not neglected, indicating that it was made to be portable rather than fixed to a wall. The owner might have taken it with him on his travels as a focus for prayer when away from home. It may have been hinged to another panel to form a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EZW-0008-0000-0000.htm">diptych</a>, which could have been closed like a book to protect the images within.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> holds the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a> in her arms. She is seated on a green cushion placed upon a marble box-like seat – its surface and the step supporting her feet are decorated with coloured marble inlays outlined with <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOV-0008-0000-0000.htm">gilding</a>. The front is carved with acanthus leaves and rosettes recalling Roman sarcophagi (marble tombs) which were usually elaborately decorated. The corbels that jut out beneath the upper surface are similar to those found supporting roofs in ancient buildings and seem to suggest that, like a tomb, the structure has a lid. Two angels hold up a red cloth, embroidered with gold thread, creating a makeshift throne. The combination of tomb and throne may be intended to make a theological point about Christ’s dual nature as human and divine. As a human he was crucified and died but as a divine being he was resurrected, majestically triumphing over death. Here Christ is still a baby, his little foot resting upon his mother’s wrist as he reaches to touch her face. Her expression is sorrowful, however, as though she is contemplating his future sacrifice.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">When this painting was acquired by the National Gallery in 1968 it was thought to be by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0OZ3-0001-0000-0000.htm">Duccio di Buoninsegna</a>, the most well-known fourteenth-century Sienese painter. Recently, technical investigation using <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV5-0008-0000-0000.htm">infrared</a> light has enabled us to see the drawing beneath the painted surface. Comparisons of this drawing with those found under paintings firmly attributed to Duccio, such as <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FD8-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Virgin and Child with Saint Dominic and Saint Aurea, and Patriarchs and Prophets</a></span>, show how different they are. It compares well, however, with the drawing found on <span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FOS-0001-0000-0000.htm">The Betrayal of Christ</a></span> from the Santa Croce altarpiece – Ugolino’s only surviving signed work.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">As accomplished artists from the same city, Ugolino and Duccio would certainly have known each other’s work well.  The Christ Child’s tender gesture recalls small panels by Duccio including the picture known as the Stoclet Madonna in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Examination of the underdrawing shows that the artist changed his mind while painting and diverged from Duccio’s version slightly by turning Christ’s face towards the viewer, perhaps to allow a more engaging view. This little panel has been dated to 1305 to reflect the fact that it resembles Duccio’s work at around this time when, as here, his contours and colours were soft and muted.</p></div>
