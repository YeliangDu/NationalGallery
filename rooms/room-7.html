It is also one of the only small paintings by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PEI-0001-0000-0000.htm">Correggio</a> whose original patron is known. In his <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lives of the Artists</span>, <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F33-0008-0000-0000.htm">Vasari</a> records a painting by Correggio in which ‘Our Lady puts a shirt on the Christ Child’ in the collection of Cavaliere Francesco Baiardo. Baiardo was Correggio’s friend and protector, and later became <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PPF-0001-0000-0000.htm">Parmigianino</a>’s greatest patron.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits under a tree, her work basket with its iron shears and ball of grey wool at her side, trying a grey jacket she has just made on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ Child</a>. It may be the seamless coat that legend claims grew with him and for which the soldiers cast lots at the foot of the Cross (John 19:23–4). The wriggly child stretches his arms out in a manner that may be meant to foreshadow the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ES3-0008-0000-0000.htm">Crucifixion</a>. He reaches towards the sun-dappled leaves, his right hand in a gesture that recalls the act of blessing. Mary is not wearing her traditional regal robes of ultramarine blue but a simple gown of faded rose.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The picture is a soft harmony of grey-pinks and grey-blues. Correggio learned his famous softness from the gradual smoky fade from shadow to light that he saw in <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>’s Milanese paintings. His approach to colour and the blur and shimmer of his brush also reveal the influence of Venetian painters such as <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q3F-0001-0000-0000.htm">Titian</a>. The atmosphere is one of innocence, and maternal and filial love, suffused with tenderness. In its intensity of emotion, the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Madonna of the Basket</span> is very close to Correggio’s <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Lamentation</span> of 1524 (Galleria Nazionale, Parma), suggesting a similar date. The diagonal composition (falling from top left down to bottom right), the twisting pose of the Virgin and the extreme foreshortening of Christ’s leg are made to seem effortless, demonstrating Correggio’s mastery of his art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EHY-0008-0000-0000.htm">Joseph</a> can be seen in the background, pale as if in a haze of sawdust in the sunshine, at work with a plane in his trade as a carpenter. The family’s simple home has been built alongside grandiose ruins – a symbol of the new faith rising out of the wreckage of pagan antiquity. The ruins and image of Joseph working recall <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0PBS-0001-0000-0000.htm">Dürer</a>’s print of the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Holy Family in Egypt</span> (British Museum, London), revealing Correggio’s interest in German art.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Correggio has depicted the modest domestic life of the holy family to stress the humility of Christ and the Virgin and their all too human sufferings. These down-to-earth, familiar details and the deep sentiment of the scene are intended to make the holy family seem approachable and emotionally open to us. This approach prefigures developments in seventeenth-century religious art.</p></div>

Joseph, as Pharaoh’s vizier, sits on a chariot in the bottom right of the painting, deciding who should receive grain during the famine that he foretold. The elderly Jacob appears again wearing blue in the left foreground, kneeling at Pharaoh’s feet as Joseph introduces him. Joseph holds the hand of his own son as he takes him up the steps to visit the dying Jacob. In the concluding episode at the top right we see Joseph at his father’s bedside as Jacob blesses Joseph’s sons. This type of picture, in which several parts of a story are shown simultaneously, is known as a continuous narrative.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The story here is fragmented, presented almost like snatches from a dream. The stage set is oddly ill-defined, with sweeping curves and figures of different scales. The bright, acid colours are influenced by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0Q2C-0001-0000-0000.htm">Michelangelo</a>’s later work, particularly his recently completed Sistine Chapel ceiling <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ERD-0008-0000-0000.htm">frescoes</a>, which were unveiled in 1512.

Joseph refused the sexual advances of Potiphar’s wife, who falsely accused him of rape and had him thrown into jail. When in prison Joseph interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh’s butler and baker, who had been imprisoned for offending him. Joseph foresaw that the butler would be reinstated but the baker would be hanged (<span class="dokuwiki_italic"><a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EFA-0001-0000-0000.htm">Pharaoh with his Butler and Baker</a></span>).</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Joseph had asked the butler to mention him to Pharaoh and secure his release, but the butler forgot.

A statue of an old man pointing to the open page of his book towers over them on a column at the foot of the staircase. He may be an Old Testament prophet but his identity is unclear.

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This painting was inspired by a passage in the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Punica</span>, an epic poem by Silius Italicus (AD 25–101) recounting the story of the Second Punic War. This particular scene had never been painted before, and <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> may have been directed to it by a learned friend or patron. The little square <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a> is painted with minute attention to detail and a jewel-like finish, reminiscent of a <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FM4-0008-0000-0000.htm">manuscript illustration</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">While resting in the shade of a bay tree, the young soldier <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FCG-0008-0000-0000.htm">Scipio</a> has a vision of two ladies, Virtue and her adversary Pleasure. Virtue promises Scipio honour, fame and glory through victory in war. Pleasure, with fragrant flowing hair and beguiling eyes, promises a life of ease and serenity. Virtue on the left is soberly dressed with her hair covered. She offers Scipio a book and a sword, emblems of learning and valour. Pleasure’s dress is hooked up at her hip and her fair hair escapes from her billowing veil as she offers Scipio a sprig of flowers, standing for love. The hard path of virtue is represented by the craggy rock in the background, while Pleasure’s gentle meadows slope down to the shores of a lake.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Silius’s passage was based on the story of <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ENK-0008-0000-0000.htm">Hercules</a> at the crossroads, in which the hero had to choose between the paths of virtue and pleasure. Scipio, like Hercules before him, chose Virtue with her accompanying trials, victories and fame. Raphael would have been familiar with the story of the choice of Hercules since the legend inspired the prologue of his father Giovanni Santi’s epic poem about the life and deeds of Federigo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino. Raphael’s father’s version is the only one in which the hero is asleep.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Raphael interpreted the theme not as a moral dilemma but rather as a combination of all the virtues to which an ideal soldier or knight should aspire. The evergreen leaves of the bay tree in the centre of the symmetrical composition symbolise the lasting honour a good knight could hope to win through his military, scholarly and amorous activities. In the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ELJ-0008-0000-0000.htm">cartoon</a> for the painting (British Museum, London) Raphael originally drew Pleasure as a more seductive figure in a low-cut dress. However, in the finished picture she is more modestly dressed, emphasising her role here as the knightly prize, Love.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph"><span class="dokuwiki_italic">An Allegory</span> is first recorded in the Borghese collection in Rome in the seventeenth century together with a painting identical in size and style now in the Musée Condé, Chantilly. This shows the Three Graces – Chastity, Beauty and Love – each holding a perfect golden ball. The two paintings were probably conceived as a pair although they were probably not intended to be displayed side by side, as the figures are different sizes. It is likely that either one picture was intended as the cover for the other and they were framed back to back, or that they were kept as treasures in a cloth bag or drawer. The combination of the traditionally masculine virtues of courage, learning and love with the traditionally feminine virtues of chastity, beauty and love suggest that the two little paintings may have been made to mark the occasion of a marriage.</p></div>

        <div class="prose"><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">This is one of several small and medium-sized Madonnas made by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0QCD-0001-0000-0000.htm">Raphael</a> in the years immediately following his arrival in Rome, at the same time as he was painting his masterwork – a suite of rooms in the Vatican palace for the pope, the so-called papal <span class="dokuwiki_italic">stanze</span>. It was probably produced for a member of the papal court for private devotion, although we do not know who commissioned it. The painting is now known as the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Garvagh Madonna</span> or the <span class="dokuwiki_italic">Aldobrandini Madonna</span> after two of its previous owners.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EOR-0008-0000-0000.htm">Virgin Mary</a> sits in a complex twisting pose – sideways on a simple bench or plinth with one leg tucked under the other. She wears a blue, green and gold striped headdress bound up into a turban-like arrangement which was probably fashionable in Rome during Raphael’s time. The infant <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0EMO-0008-0000-0000.htm">Christ</a> sits on his mother’s lap, looking down towards the young <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0F8Q-0008-0000-0000.htm">John the Baptist</a>, who passes him a red carnation – symbolic of divine love and Christ’s future <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0ETT-0008-0000-0000.htm">Passion</a>. Their gazes suggest the thoughts that pass between them. The space between the children’s hands is the very centre of the careful geometry of the composition, emphasised by the lines of the architectural backdrop and the Virgin’s features.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Christ’s pose is very natural, although he seems to have an awareness greater than his years. The Virgin appears lost in melancholy thought as she draws John the Baptist’s soft fur pelt closer to him and gathers her mantle to cover the naked Christ. Perhaps she is thinking of the children’s destinies.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">Two arched openings either side of the Virgin reveal views reminiscent of the countryside outside Rome. Through the left-hand arch is a church with a bell tower and hills shrouded in blue haze. A larger building, possibly also a church, is visible through the right-hand arch. In the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FUK-0008-0000-0000.htm">underdrawing</a>, the landscape continues beneath the central architecture, suggesting that Raphael first intended to set the figures before a simple stone parapet but then changed his mind. The vivid colours of the Virgin’s clothes – the bright pink of her dress and two subtly different blues of her shirt and mantle – are echoed in the more soft and faded pastel hues of the misty landscape.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">A study for the painting on pink paper in the Musée des Beaux Arts, Lille, shows that Raphael experimented with different positions for the children. There is no sign that the design for the final painting was transferred from a drawing, but there is a very precise geometrical plan in the underdrawing on the <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0FV0-0008-0000-0000.htm">panel</a>.</p><p class="dokuwiki_paragraph">The dark backdrop and mouldings of the architecture very effectively frame the Virgin’s oval face and the delicate bend of her neck. This approach of showing the Virgin in an interior between two arched windows occurs in early works by <a class="dokuwiki_link" href="https://data.ng.ac.uk/0POV-0001-0000-0000.htm">Leonardo</a>, and it is possible that Raphael had these examples in mind. The complex psychological interaction between the figures also reflects earlier innovations by Leonardo. The figures are perfectly integrated into their setting, creating a sense of order and calm contemplation. Raphael makes divine harmony visible through geometry.</p></div>
